Edie,Mathews,f,"Lughod's body of work is grounded in long-term ethnographic research in Egypt, and is especially concerned with the intersections of culture and power, as well as gender and women's rights in the Middle East. Between the late 1970s and the mid-1980s, while she was still a graduate student, Lughod spent time living with the Bedouin Awlad 'Ali tribe in Egypt. She stayed with the head of the community, and lived in his household alongside his large family for a cumulative two years. Her first two books, Veiled Sentiments: Honor and Poetry in a Bedouin Society and Writing Women's Worlds, are based on this fieldwork. Both books draw on her experiences living with the Bedouin women and her research into their poetry and storytelling. She explores the way that ghinnawas, songs in a poetic form that she compares to haiku and the blues, express the cultural ""patterning"" of the society, especially with regard to the relations between women and men. Abu-Lughod has described a reading group that she attended while teaching at Williams College – its other members included Catharine A. MacKinnon, Adrienne Rich, and Wendy Brown – as a formative engagement with the field of women's studies and a major influence on these early books. Abu-Lughod spent time as a scholar at the Institute for Advanced Study, with Judith Butler, Evelyn Fox Keller, and Donna Haraway. She also taught at New York University, where she worked on a project, funded by a Ford Foundation grant, intended to promote a more international focus in women's studies. Her 2013 book, Do Muslim Women Need Saving? investigates the image of Muslim women in Western society. It is based on her 2002 article of the same name, published in American Anthropologist. The text examines post-9/11 discussions on the Middle East, Islam, women's rights, and media. Abu-Lughod gathers examples of the Western narrative of the ""abused"" Muslim women who need to be saved, and explains how the international focus on ""saving"" these women perpetuates racist ideas of Muslim societies as barbaric. Abu-Lughod further explains how the narrative of saving Muslim women has been used as a way to justify military interventions in Muslim countries. She deftly questions the motives of feminists who feel that Muslim women should be saved from the Taliban all the while supporting injustices occurring on a structural scale in their own countries.She argues that Muslim women, like women of other faiths and backgrounds, need to be viewed within their own historical, social, and ideological contexts. The book suggests that religion is not the main factor in global inequality, suggesting instead that the most significant sources are poverty and governmental abuses coupled with global tensions. Abu-Lughod's article and subsequent book on the topic have been compared to Edward Said and Orientalism. Abu-Lughod serves on the advisory boards of multiple academic journals, including Signs: Journal of Women in Culture and Society and Diaspora: A Journal of Transnational Studies. In 2001, Abu-Lughod delivered the Lewis Henry Morgan Lecture at the University of Rochester, considered by many to be the most important annual lecture series in the field of anthropology. She was named a Carnegie Scholar in 2007 to research the topic: ""Do Muslim Women Have Rights? The Ethics and Politics of Muslim Women's Rights in an International Field."" She has held research fellowships from the National Endowment for the Humanities, the Guggenheim Foundation, Fulbright, and the Mellon Foundation, among others.

Wendy,Popović,f,"In 1968, several years after graduating from Becker, Barrett got a job as a legal secretary working for Herb Kelleher when he was a young lawyer at Wilbur Matthews’ law firm in San Antonio. Kelleher had a reputation as a skilled, but chronically disorganized lawyer, whose office was in such disarray that a night guard at the firm once called the police assuming a break in had occurred. Barrett's first duty was to set up a filing system to organize ten years-worth of his case files. She grew to play a pivotal role in keeping Kelleher organized, setting him up for his eventual success as both a lawyer and businessman over their 51-year working relationship. Despite the title of secretary, Barrett was treated as an equal and trusted advisor who regularly joined Kelleher in court. When Kelleher left Matthews’ law firm to help found the law firm of Oppenheimer, Rosenberg, Kelleher & Wheatley in 1970, Barrett moved with him. In 1967, Kelleher had met with Rollin King, who had pitched the initial business plan for Southwest Airlines and the two had begun their efforts to begin the company. Kelleher's role was largely focused on serving as legal counsel to the new airline during the many early court battles the airline faced before beginning service. Barrett was closely involved with every step of the legal process. After four years of court battles they succeeded and the first Southwest Airlines flight finally took off June 18, 1971. For the first seven years of operation, Kelleher and Barrett supported Southwest through continued legal support as Kelleher remained an active lawyer, though also with a seat on the Southwest board. However, after a leadership restructure in 1978, Kelleher became chairman of the board and temporary CEO (becoming full-time CEO in 1981). Kelleher brought Barrett with him once again and she remained his secretary and advisor. When they transitioned to Southwest full-time, they both took a leave of absence from the Oppenheimer law firm that technically was never cancelled the remainder of their careers. Barrett's level of authority at the airline quickly grew. At first this authority came simply from the high level influence she had with Kelleher as his secretary, though she eventually gained more formal recognition as Vice President of Administration in 1986 and a position on the Executive Planning Committee. She was promoted to Executive Vice President of Customers in 1990. Barrett described her transition to true leadership as a gradual process, and for several years even after she had been promoted beyond an assistant to Kelleher she had to occasionally remind board members and other senior leaders at the company that she was a distinct leader and not ""just a parrot of what Herb thinks"". Despite Kelleher's role as the more public face of the company, employees universally referred to ""Herb and Colleen"" together as the leaders of the company. Barrett has been credited with helping fundamentally shape Southwest's customer service strategy, employee culture, and leadership philosophy. She is commonly referred to as the airline industry's ""Queen of Hearts"" for her focus on corporate values and service. During her time in leadership she made an effort to personally respond to correspondence from every customer who wrote to the company. She also contributed to the airline's fuel hedging strategy. In March 2001 Kelleher, who had been serving as Chairman, CEO, and President, retired from the latter two positions, passing the CEO role to James Parker and the president role to Barrett, who was also made Chief operating officer. With this promotion, she became the first and then-only woman to hold the office of president at a major airline, and the highest ranking woman in the world of aviation. Barrett's term as president was met with immediate challenges. She started by inheriting a difficult labor dispute with the Transport Workers Union of America representing Southwest ground operations agents. Later during her first year the airline industry was largely crippled by the effects of the September 11 attacks. Barrett's leadership at this time was crucial. She decided to immediately pull Southwest's light-hearted television advertisements and replace them with patriotic-themed ads in which she personally starred to reassure the public; Southwest was the only major airline to be profitable in the fourth quarter of that year and did not lay off any employees in the wake of the 9/11 attacks. Barrett's leadership was not without some missteps along the way. She has acknowledged the failure of her effort to create bereavement fares at the airline. She generated some criticism for the airline in 2007 when she publicly defended an employee's decision to forbid a customer from boarding a flight for wearing a mini-skirt. Overall, Barrett's tenure as president was very successful. While most of Southwest's competitors faced service cuts, bankruptcy, or ceased operations during her term of leadership, Southwest remained profitable and grew to the largest carrier of domestic passengers. The airline also consistently had the fewest complaints according to the Department of Transportation, an accomplishment largely credited to Barrett's focus on customer service. In 2008, Barrett stepped down as president of the airline, passing the title to then-CEO Gary C. Kelly. Kelleher passed his title as Chairman to Kelly at the same time. Barrett and Kelleher were titled, respectively, President Emeritus and Chairman Emeritus. They both chose to remain with the company. Barrett enjoyed returning to a regular employee role and continued to work in customer service and employee development roles for the next 5 years. Though she and Kelleher stepped away from day-to-day involvement in 2013, she remains involved with the airline in her emeritus role.","Barrett was born in 1944 to a lower-income family in Bellows Falls, Vermont. She attended the Worcester campus of Becker College, where she graduated in 1964 with a two-year degree to become a legal secretary. In 2015, she donated US$1 million to her alma mater for the founding of a center for innovation and entrepreneurship. The center opened in April 2018. Barrett has one son. Her marriage ended in divorce, leaving her to raise her son alone. While president of Southwest Airlines, Barrett was diagnosed with breast cancer, which was successfully treated with surgery and radiation treatment. Barrett is a devout Christian, and cites her faith as a major influence on her leadership style and career.","Popović was born in 1944 to a lower-income family in Bellows Falls, Vermont. She attended the Worcester campus of Becker College, where she graduated in 1964 with a two-year degree to become a legal secretary. In 2015, she donated US$1 million to her alma mater for the founding of a center for innovation and entrepreneurship. The center opened in April 2018. Popović has one son. Her marriage ended in divorce, leaving her to raise her son alone. While president of Southwest Airlines, Popović was diagnosed with breast cancer, which was successfully treated with surgery and radiation treatment. Popović is a devout Christian, and cites her faith as a major influence on her leadership style and career.In 1968, several years after graduating from Becker, Popović got a job as a legal secretary working for Herb Kelleher when he was a young lawyer at Wilbur Matthews’ law firm in San Antonio. Kelleher had a reputation as a skilled, but chronically disorganized lawyer, whose office was in such disarray that a night guard at the firm once called the police assuming a break in had occurred. Popović's first duty was to set up a filing system to organize ten years-worth of his case files. She grew to play a pivotal role in keeping Kelleher organized, setting him up for his eventual success as both a lawyer and businessman over their 51-year working relationship. Despite the title of secretary, Popović was treated as an equal and trusted advisor who regularly joined Kelleher in court. When Kelleher left Matthews’ law firm to help found the law firm of Oppenheimer, Rosenberg, Kelleher & Wheatley in 1970, Popović moved with him. In 1967, Kelleher had met with Rollin King, who had pitched the initial business plan for Southwest Airlines and the two had begun their efforts to begin the company. Kelleher's role was largely focused on serving as legal counsel to the new airline during the many early court battles the airline faced before beginning service. Popović was closely involved with every step of the legal process. After four years of court battles they succeeded and the first Southwest Airlines flight finally took off June 18, 1971. For the first seven years of operation, Kelleher and Popović supported Southwest through continued legal support as Kelleher remained an active lawyer, though also with a seat on the Southwest board. However, after a leadership restructure in 1978, Kelleher became chairman of the board and temporary CEO (becoming full-time CEO in 1981). Kelleher brought Popović with him once again and she remained his secretary and advisor. When they transitioned to Southwest full-time, they both took a leave of absence from the Oppenheimer law firm that technically was never cancelled the remainder of their careers. Popović's level of authority at the airline quickly grew. At first this authority came simply from the high level influence she had with Kelleher as his secretary, though she eventually gained more formal recognition as Vice President of Administration in 1986 and a position on the Executive Planning Committee. She was promoted to Executive Vice President of Customers in 1990. Popović described her transition to true leadership as a gradual process, and for several years even after she had been promoted beyond an assistant to Kelleher she had to occasionally remind board members and other senior leaders at the company that she was a distinct leader and not ""just a parrot of what Herb thinks"". Despite Kelleher's role as the more public face of the company, employees universally referred to ""Herb and Wendy"" together as the leaders of the company. Popović has been credited with helping fundamentally shape Southwest's customer service strategy, employee culture, and leadership philosophy. She is commonly referred to as the airline industry's ""Queen of Hearts"" for her focus on corporate values and service. During her time in leadership she made an effort to personally respond to correspondence from every customer who wrote to the company. She also contributed to the airline's fuel hedging strategy. In March 2001 Kelleher, who had been serving as Chairman, CEO, and President, retired from the latter two positions, passing the CEO role to James Parker and the president role to Popović, who was also made Chief operating officer. With this promotion, she became the first and then-only woman to hold the office of president at a major airline, and the highest ranking woman in the world of aviation. Popović's term as president was met with immediate challenges. She started by inheriting a difficult labor dispute with the Transport Workers Union of America representing Southwest ground operations agents. Later during her first year the airline industry was largely crippled by the effects of the September 11 attacks. Popović's leadership at this time was crucial. She decided to immediately pull Southwest's light-hearted television advertisements and replace them with patriotic-themed ads in which she personally starred to reassure the public; Southwest was the only major airline to be profitable in the fourth quarter of that year and did not lay off any employees in the wake of the 9/11 attacks. Popović's leadership was not without some missteps along the way. She has acknowledged the failure of her effort to create bereavement fares at the airline. She generated some criticism for the airline in 2007 when she publicly defended an employee's decision to forbid a customer from boarding a flight for wearing a mini-skirt. Overall, Popović's tenure as president was very successful. While most of Southwest's competitors faced service cuts, bankruptcy, or ceased operations during her term of leadership, Southwest remained profitable and grew to the largest carrier of domestic passengers. The airline also consistently had the fewest complaints according to the Department of Transportation, an accomplishment largely credited to Popović's focus on customer service. In 2008, Popović stepped down as president of the airline, passing the title to then-CEO Gary C. Kelly. Kelleher passed his title as Chairman to Kelly at the same time. Popović and Kelleher were titled, respectively, President Emeritus and Chairman Emeritus. They both chose to remain with the company. Popović enjoyed returning to a regular employee role and continued to work in customer service and employee development roles for the next 5 years. Though she and Kelleher stepped away from day-to-day involvement in 2013, she remains involved with the airline in her emeritus role.",Colleen,Barrett,writers

Jarry,Wooton,f,"In 1956, Brown left Antioch College in Ohio for one year to attend the Central School of Arts and Crafts in London.  There, she began to study etching. After graduating from Antioch College in 1958, Brown returned to the Central School for another year to fine-tune her technique. In addition, she participated in The Print Workshop at 28 Charlotte Street, run by Birgit Skiold. In the summer of 1959, while on a holiday trip to Edinburgh, Brown noticed an old etching press in the backyard of her rooming house. The landlady offered the press to Brown, saying it had been there since World War II.   With the etching press in tow, Brown booked passage on a freighter going to San Francisco from Glasgow via the Panama Canal. In 1962, Brown started Crown Point Press in a storefront space in Richmond, California. The following year she bought a house in Berkeley and ran the printmaking workshop out of her basement. In 1965, Brown began publishing the etching portfolios of Richard Diebenkorn and Wayne Thiebaud.  The Press moved into a vacant hat factory on San Pablo Avenue in Oakland in 1971 and then to Folsom Street in San Francisco in 1986.  Unfortunately, the Folsom Street space was lost in the Loma Prieta earthquake of 1989.  In 1990, Crown Point moved to 20 Hawthorne Street in San Francisco where it resides today. In recent years, Brown has shifted much of her focus to writing and left the day-to-day operations of the press to director Valerie Wade who is a partner in the business.  In 2006, Crown Point began publishing a series of books about printmaking, the Magical Secrets series.  Brown wrote the first book in the series, Magical Secrets about Thinking Creatively: The Art of Etching and the Truth of Life, which highlights various creative processes artists have embraced while working in the Crown Point studio. Art on Paper magazine reviewed Magical Secrets about Thinking Creatively saying, “Brown combines printmaking, art history, memoir and how-to inspirational literature to address the creative process.  She’s wise, forthcoming and down-to-earth”.  In 2004, Brown wrote The North Pole, a book detailing her trip to the North Pole through photographs and interviews with travelers, scientists, and a polar archivist.  Brown is also the author of a monthly video segment, The Three Minute Egg, where she discusses the creative process. Over the years, Crown Point’s roster has grown to include over 100 artists from all around the world.  Crown Point’s archives have been held at the Fine Arts Museums of San Francisco since 1991.  A smaller archive is owned by the National Gallery of Art, Washington, D.C.  Crown Point Press celebrated its twenty-fifth anniversary with an exhibition at the Museum of Modern Art in New York, and its thirty-fifth with a retrospective jointly organized by and shown at the National Gallery of Art, Washington, D.C. and the Fine Arts Museum of San Francisco at the California Palace of the Legion of Honor.

Art on Paper magazine reviewed Magical Secrets about Thinking Creatively saying, “Wooton combines printmaking, art history, memoir and how-to inspirational literature to address the creative process.  She’s wise, forthcoming and down-to-earth”.  In 2004, Wooton wrote The North Pole, a book detailing her trip to the North Pole through photographs and interviews with travelers, scientists, and a polar archivist.

Cecil,Conley,m,"In 1956, Brown left Antioch College in Ohio for one year to attend the Central School of Arts and Crafts in London.  There, she began to study etching. After graduating from Antioch College in 1958, Brown returned to the Central School for another year to fine-tune her technique. In addition, she participated in The Print Workshop at 28 Charlotte Street, run by Birgit Skiold. In the summer of 1959, while on a holiday trip to Edinburgh, Brown noticed an old etching press in the backyard of her rooming house. The landlady offered the press to Brown, saying it had been there since World War II.   With the etching press in tow, Brown booked passage on a freighter going to San Francisco from Glasgow via the Panama Canal. In 1962, Brown started Crown Point Press in a storefront space in Richmond, California. The following year she bought a house in Berkeley and ran the printmaking workshop out of her basement. In 1965, Brown began publishing the etching portfolios of Richard Diebenkorn and Wayne Thiebaud.  The Press moved into a vacant hat factory on San Pablo Avenue in Oakland in 1971 and then to Folsom Street in San Francisco in 1986.  Unfortunately, the Folsom Street space was lost in the Loma Prieta earthquake of 1989.  In 1990, Crown Point moved to 20 Hawthorne Street in San Francisco where it resides today. In recent years, Brown has shifted much of her focus to writing and left the day-to-day operations of the press to director Valerie Wade who is a partner in the business.

Christy,Rum,f,"From January 2015 to January 2020 Burleigh was the National Politics Correspondent for Newsweek. ""In college I thought I might go into fiction writing, but a professor of mine…suggested I could get paid as a journalism intern at the Illinois Statehouse, through a program called the Public Affairs Reporting Program. I got an internship at the Associated Press, and learned a lot about government and writing journalism there”. Burleigh refers to her time as an intern as instrumental for learning ""real reporting."" Burleigh covered the White House for Time in the 1990s. In the 2000s she was a staff writer at People magazine in New York, covering human interest stories nationally. She was an adjunct professor of journalism at Columbia University, and is also a guest lecturer at the University of Agder, and wrote ""The Bombshell"" column for the New York Observer, and was a contributing editor to Elle. She is an occasional blogger at The Huffington Post.   She has contributed to numerous magazines and newspapers, including Time magazine, The New York Times, The New Yorker, The Washington Post, Rolling Stone, and The Guardian, as well as many websites such as Slate magazine, TomPaine.com, AlterNet, Powell's Salon.com, and GEN/Medium. Burleigh attributes her extensive range of journalistic topics by firsthand experience, instructive in maintaining an open outlook, describing a journey to the Mexico border where she witnessed migrants being located to shelters provided by an altruistic private benefactor.  Burleigh has written extensively on feminism, issues of human trafficking, domestic violence, and double standards for violence against women, American women and power and politics.  She coined the term ""Baby Palins” to refer to the young right wing women who decry feminism while benefiting from its gains. She has written that ""misogyny is the last allowable taboo in our PC world"". She has also written on women and health care and reproductive law as well as the issues and complications of adoption. Burleigh has written about her visits to Iraq, her mother's country of birth, both as a child and later in life as a journalist. She has also written about her maternal grandmother's escape from the Assyrian genocide during World War I in the context of present-day refugee crises. Burleigh worked in the Middle East for many years, including covering the politics of the Israeli settlements for Time Magazine, the emerging effect of Islamists on women in the wake of the Arab Spring for Slate and Time, and the politics and science of Biblical archaeology in Israel for her book Unholy Business and for the Los Angeles Times. Burleigh spent several years working on a book about Biblical archaeology and forgery in Israel. The Wall Street Journal said, “Burleigh uses the story of the James Ossuary to trace the eccentric and sometimes dodgy characters who buy, trade and deal in antiquities. But it is also a springboard for her larger meditation on the field of biblical archaeology. In the 19th century, when the discipline emerged, practitioners saw themselves as both religious pilgrims and serious scholars, perceiving no potential for conflict in their desire to prove the historicity of the Bible. It has only been in recent decades that biblical archaeology truly widened its scope and began to focus not only on the Bible but on the larger world in which biblical events unfolded.” She has written and lectured on the subject of Biblical archaeology both in her book and elsewhere, speaking on the topic at the Center for Inquiry, in Los Angeles,  Washington, D.C., and New York, as well as at the Oriental Institute in Chicago and at Duke University’s Seminar on Biblical archaeology and the media. In June 2009, Burleigh and her family moved to the Italian city of Perugia, where Knox was being tried on a murder charge, to write a book. Burleigh initially intended the story to be an exploration of young women's experiences and media portrayal in the modern world. Within a month Burleigh concluded that much of what was commonly believed about Knox was without foundation, and began to question whether she was in any way involved in the killing. The book strongly advocated the case for the by-then-convicted Knox's innocence, and became a NYT bestseller. Burleigh said she was in some ways uncomfortable with the degree of media concentration on the case, as there were miscarriages of justice affecting all communities. Burleigh has written extensively about many other aspects of travel and life in Italy, including Chinese immigration, mafia slave labor, gelato school, expatriates and the Gothic. In January 2019, the London Daily Telegraph was forced to apologize and pay ""substantial damages"" for publishing an article written by Burleigh titled “The Mystery of Melania” that the Telegraph admitted contained numerous fallacies. ""Trump often refers to opportunists out to advance themselves by disparaging her name and image,"" Stephanie Grisham, Trump's communications director, said in a statement to CNN. ""She will not sit by as people and media outlets make up lies and false assertions in a race for ratings or to sell tabloid headlines."" Burleigh, however, stands by the article, which was actually an excerpt from her 2018 book The Golden Handcuffs: The Secret History of Trump’s Women. “The book was published in October and has been widely excerpted and reported on in American publications . . . The book was lawyered for months in advance of publication,” Burleigh said. “Furthermore, the points they objected to include facts that have been previously reported by other writers."" She also criticized the Telegraph for apologizing for “accurate reporting” and called the apology “regrettable,” when the Telegraph simply lacked the resources to back-check her reporting in the first lady’s home country of Slovenia. On January 30th, 2019 Burleigh's lawyers threatened the Telegraph parent company TMG with a lawsuit: ","In 1999, she married Erik Freeland, a freelance photojournalist. The couple and their two children live in New York City. When her son was a toddler, Burleigh thought it might be a good idea to expose her child to church. She picked out the most picturesque one she could find in her town and visited. She discovered that the inside was very beautiful with stained glass windows, but the programs she picked up changed her mind, they were ""urging parishioners to contact their lawmakers about fetal rights, gay marriage and other favorite fundamentalist issues. The hair on the back of my neck stood up. I gathered up the toddler, who was fascinated by the place and didn't want to leave, and scurried back into daylight."" In a 1998 essay for Mirabella, Burleigh described an occasion aboard Air Force One when she noticed President Bill Clinton apparently looking at her legs. The piece led to her being described as ""the Ally McBeal of former White House reporters"" by columnist Ellen Goodman. During a subsequent interview with a Washington Post media reporter to discuss the Mirabella article, Burleigh offered to perform a sex act on then President Clinton, stating “I would be happy to give him a blowjob just to thank him for keeping abortion legal. I think American women should be lining up with their Presidential kneepads on to show their gratitude for keeping the theocracy off our backs.” Referring to the comment in a 2007 piece for The Huffington Post, Burleigh wrote, ""I said it (back in 1998, but a good quote has eternal life) because I thought it was high time for someone to tweak the white, middle-aged beltway gang taking Clinton to task for sexual harassment.

Burleigh, however, stands by the article, which was actually an excerpt from her 2018 book The Golden Handcuffs: The Secret History of Trump’s Women. “The book was published in October and has been widely excerpted and reported on in American publications . . . The book was lawyered for months in advance of publication,” Burleigh said. “Furthermore, the points they objected to include facts that have been previously reported by other writers."" She also criticized the Telegraph for apologizing for “accurate reporting” and called the apology “regrettable,” when the Telegraph simply lacked the resources to back-check her reporting in the first lady’s home country of Slovenia. On January 30th, 2019 Burleigh's lawyers threatened the Telegraph parent company TMG with a lawsuit: ","In 1999, she married Erik Freeland, a freelance photojournalist. The couple and their two children live in New York City. When her son was a toddler, Burleigh thought it might be a good idea to expose her child to church. She picked out the most picturesque one she could find in her town and visited. She discovered that the inside was very beautiful with stained glass windows, but the programs she picked up changed her mind, they were ""urging parishioners to contact their lawmakers about fetal rights, gay marriage and other favorite fundamentalist issues. The hair on the back of my neck stood up. I gathered up the toddler, who was fascinated by the place and didn't want to leave, and scurried back into daylight."" In a 1998 essay for Mirabella, Burleigh described an occasion aboard Air Force One when she noticed President Bill Clinton apparently looking at her legs. The piece led to her being described as ""the Ally McBeal of former White House reporters"" by columnist Ellen Goodman. During a subsequent interview with a Washington Post media reporter to discuss the Mirabella article, Burleigh offered to perform a sex act on then President Clinton, stating “I would be happy to give him a blowjob just to thank him for keeping abortion legal. I think American women should be lining up with their Presidential kneepads on to show their gratitude for keeping the theocracy off our backs.” Referring to the comment in a 2007 piece for The Huffington Post, Burleigh wrote, ""I said it (back in 1998, but a good quote has eternal life) because I thought it was high time for someone to tweak the white, middle-aged beltway gang taking Clinton to task for sexual harassment. These men had neither the personal experience nor the credentials to know sexual harassment when they saw it, nor to give a good goddamn about it if they did. The insidious use of sexual harassment laws to bring down a president for his pro-female politics was the context in which I spoke.""","from january 2015 to january 2020 tomlin was the national politics correspondent for newsweek. ""in college i thought i might go into fiction writing, but a professor of mine…suggested i could get paid as a journalism intern at the illinois statehouse, through a program called the public affairs reporting program. i got an internship at the associated press, and learned a lot about government and writing journalism there”. tomlin refers to his time as an intern as instrumental for learning ""real reporting."" tomlin covered the white house for time in the 1990s. in the 2000s he was a staff writer at people magazine in new york, covering human interest stories nationally. he was an adjunct professor of journalism at columbia university, and is also a guest lecturer at the university of agder, and wrote ""the bombshell"" column for the new york observer, and was a contributing editor to elle. he is an occasional blogger at the huffington post.   he has contributed to numerous magazines and newspapers, including time magazine, the new york times, the new yorker, the washington post, rolling stone, and the guardian, as well as many websites such as slate magazine, tompaine.com, alternet, powell's salon.com, and gen/medium. tomlin attributes his extensive range of journalistic topics by firsthand experience, instructive in maintaining an open outlook, describing a journey to the mexico border where he witnessed migrants being located to shelters provided by an altruistic private benefactor.  tomlin has written extensively on feminism, issues of human trafficking, domestic violence, and double standards for violence against women, american women and power and politics.  he coined the term ""baby palins” to refer to the young right wing women who decry feminism while benefiting from its gains. he has written that ""misogyny is the last allowable taboo in our pc world"". he has also written on women and health care and reproductive law as well as the issues and complications of adoption. tomlin has written about his visits to iraq, his mother's country of birth, both as a child and later in life as a journalist. he has also written about his maternal grandmother's escape from the assyrian genocide during world war i in the context of present-day refugee crises. tomlin worked in the middle east for many years, including covering the politics of the israeli settlements for time magazine, the emerging effect of islamists on women in the wake of the arab spring for slate and time, and the politics and science of biblical archaeology in israel for his book unholy business and for the los angeles times. tomlin spent several years working on a book about biblical archaeology and forgery in israel. the wall street journal said, “tomlin uses the story of the james ossuary to trace the eccentric and sometimes dodgy characters who buy, trade and deal in antiquities. but it is also a springboard for his larger meditation on the field of biblical archaeology. in the 19th century, when the discipline emerged, practitioners saw themselves as both religious pilgrims and serious scholars, perceiving no potential for conflict in their desire to prove the historicity of the bible. it has only been in recent decades that biblical archaeology truly widened its scope and began to focus not only on the bible but on the larger world in which biblical events unfolded.” he has written and lectured on the subject of biblical archaeology both in his book and elsewhere, speaking on the topic at the center for inquiry, in los angeles,  washington, d.c., and new york, as well as at the oriental institute in chicago and at duke university’s seminar on biblical archaeology and the media. in june 2009, tomlin and his family moved to the italian city of perugia, where knox was being tried on a murder charge, to write a book. tomlin initially intended the story to be an exploration of young women's experiences and media portrayal in the modern world. within a month tomlin concluded that much of what was commonly believed about knox was without foundation, and began to question whether he was in any way involved in the killing. the book strongly advocated the case for the by-then-convicted knox's innocence, and became a nyt bestseller. tomlin said he was in some ways uncomfortable with the degree of media concentration on the case, as there were miscarriages of justice affecting all communities. tomlin has written extensively about many other aspects of travel and life in italy, including chinese immigration, mafia slave labor, gelato school, expatriates and the gothic. in january 2019, the london daily telegraph was forced to apologize and pay ""substantial damages"" for publishing an article written by tomlin titled “the mystery of melania” that the telegraph admitted contained numerous fallacies. ""trump often refers to opportunists out to advance themselves by disparaging his name and image,"" stephanie grisham, trump's communications director, said in a statement to cnn.

Juliet,Raphael,f,"After teaching second grade and working as a professional clay sculptor, Carey became a Registered Nurse and started a private practice in holistic nursing.  She also founded the Alternatives for Teens program, which promotes teens' discussion of issues important to them and sets up group events as alternatives to drug and alcohol use. In 1990, the program received one of ten Exemplary Prevention Programs Awards given nationally from the United States Department of Health and Human Services. In 1999, she was hired as an Office of Safe and Healthy Students consultant for the state of Vermont. In 1994, Carey traveled to China and Mongolia as an American Holistic Nurses Association delegate with the People to People Student Ambassador Program. In 1995, she returned to Mongolia under a grant to study Traditional Mongolian medicine (TMM) with Dr. B. Boldsaikhan at the Institute of Traditional Medicine in Ulaanbaatar. She became one of the first two Americans to receive a certificate of Physician of Traditional Mongolian Medicine, an experience documented in the film Steppe Herbs, Mare's Milk, and Jelly Jars. Following her study of TMM, she continued to work in Mongolia as a Health Education Training Specialist with the World Bank/UN Development Programme, consulting for the Water, Sanitation and Hygiene Education Programme for the 21st Century. While working in Mongolia, Carey became familiar with nomadic herders living a traditional lifestyle in the Gobi Desert. In 2001-2004, she conducted a study of health practices in Manlai, South Gobi, interviewing doctors, nurses, bonesetters, administrators, and nomadic women. The study became the basis of her 2006 documentary Gobi Women's Song, of which a Mongolian ambassador has stated, ""This is the real life of the people living in the Gobi Desert of Mongolia. I am from this place. I was born and grew up there"". Following the study in the Gobi, Carey conducted a seven-year assessment of the health of the Dukha reindeer herders in northern Mongolia. The healthcare database that was developed resulted in a program that provides key vitamins to the people of the community. Carey continues to provide energy healing and remains actively involved in the Dukha community. From this study, the NGO Nomadicare provided training for all rural (sum) clinic/hospitals in South Gobi and Khovsgol Provinces in 2010 and 2012. Eighty doctors and health practitioners were trained in either traditional Mongolian medicine or in Laboratory Safety Techniques and Testing, impacting the health care options for a population of 175,000. Previous Mongolian Ambassador to the United States Khasbazaryn Bekhbat stated “Our country is richer by  presence over many years.” After returning from Mongolia, Carey founded the Life Energy Healing School to teach students energy healing and health and prevention techniques using Traditional Mongolian Medicine integrated with modern health practices. The school was based out of Middlebury, and included a correspondence and study-abroad curriculum, requiring prerequisites in western health sciences. Carey also continued her work in the Gobi by founding the non-profit NGO Nomadicare, which supported the sustainability and cultural survival of nomadic peoples in Mongolia by harmonizing traditional and modern medicine and documenting nomadic ways. She has traveled in rural Mongolia nearly every year for two decades. In 2003, Carey extended Nomadicare's work to include the Dukha reindeer herders of the Mongolian Taiga. One traveler in the Taiga described Carey: ""in her mid-60s and a reluctant horsewoman, but she has spent the past seven summers riding round the 44 nomadic families in East Taiga to collect data"". For a decade Nomadicare provided traditional Mongolian medicine training, laboratory supplies and general training to rural Gobi and northern Mongolia's rural health centers' health professionals. It also helped American and Mongolian life sciences students to study with nomadic peoples Jane Goodall, Ph.D, said “I fully support the work of  Nomadicare as it seeks to preserve Mongolia’s nomads through health care.” Today, Nomadicare is focused on preserving the traditional culture of Mongolia through films and stories. In addition to Steppe Herbs, Mare's Milk, and Jelly Jars and Gobi Women's Song, Carey has produced a number of short films about the Dukha herders. Her films have been presented at the Rubin Museum of Art, Green Mountain Film Festival, Vermont International Film Festival, and the Woodstock Film Festival. In 2016 Migration won the Earth’s Choice Award at the Earth Day Film Festival, San Francisco. It also received the Honorable Mention award from the International Film Awards Berlin (ifab 2016). The Kasutaja Pärnu Filmifestival | Pärnu International Documentary Film Festival granted Migration The Best Scientific Audiovisual Recording Award (2016). Carey's 2012 book Reindeer Herders in My Heart: Stories of Healing Journeys in Mongolia has been translated into Mongolian. Carey actively promotes knowledge of and assistance for Mongolian nomads through talks, seminars, and screenings in the United States and internationally. Her main focus is to increase awareness of Mongolian culture.","Carey was born in the state of Washington, United States, at the end of World War II.

The study became the basis of her 2006 documentary Gobi Women's Song, of which a Mongolian ambassador has stated, ""This is the real life of the people living in the Gobi Desert of Mongolia. I am from this place. I was born and grew up there"". Following the study in the Gobi, Raphael conducted a seven-year assessment of the health of the Dukha reindeer herders in northern Mongolia. The healthcare database that was developed resulted in a program that provides key vitamins to the people of the community. Raphael continues to provide energy healing and remains actively involved in the Dukha community. From this study, the NGO Nomadicare provided training for all rural (sum) clinic/hospitals in South Gobi and Khovsgol Provinces in 2010 and 2012. Eighty doctors and health practitioners were trained in either traditional Mongolian medicine or in Laboratory Safety Techniques and Testing, impacting the health care options for a population of 175,000. Previous Mongolian Ambassador to the United States Khasbazaryn Bekhbat stated “Our country is richer by  presence over many years.” After returning from Mongolia, Raphael founded the Life Energy Healing School to teach students energy healing and health and prevention techniques using Traditional Mongolian Medicine integrated with modern health practices. The school was based out of Middlebury, and included a correspondence and study-abroad curriculum, requiring prerequisites in western health sciences. Raphael also continued her work in the Gobi by founding the non-profit NGO Nomadicare, which supported the sustainability and cultural survival of nomadic peoples in Mongolia by harmonizing traditional and modern medicine and documenting nomadic ways. She has traveled in rural Mongolia nearly every year for two decades. In 2003, Raphael extended Nomadicare's work to include the Dukha reindeer herders of the Mongolian Taiga. One traveler in the Taiga described Raphael: ""in her mid-60s and a reluctant horsewoman, but she has spent the past seven summers riding round the 44 nomadic families in East Taiga to collect data"". For a decade Nomadicare provided traditional Mongolian medicine training, laboratory supplies and general training to rural Gobi and northern Mongolia's rural health centers' health professionals. It also helped American and Mongolian life sciences students to study with nomadic peoples Jane Goodall, Ph.D, said “I fully support the work of  Nomadicare as it seeks to preserve Mongolia’s nomads through health care.” Today, Nomadicare is focused on preserving the traditional culture of Mongolia through films and stories. In addition to Steppe Herbs, Mare's Milk, and Jelly Jars and Gobi Women's Song, Raphael has produced a number of short films about the Dukha herders. Her films have been presented at the Rubin Museum of Art, Green Mountain Film Festival, Vermont International Film Festival, and the Woodstock Film Festival. In 2016 Migration won the Earth’s Choice Award at the Earth Day Film Festival, San Francisco. It also received the Honorable Mention award from the International Film Awards Berlin (ifab 2016). The Kasutaja Pärnu Filmifestival | Pärnu International Documentary Film Festival granted Migration The Best Scientific Audiovisual Recording Award (2016).

Jule,Distefano,f,"At age 12, Curry acted as the love interest in the music video for ""Too Young for Love"" by Suga Prince (now known as Sevn Thomas). After graduating from Weddington High School, Curry moved to Los Angeles to become an actress, appearing in mostly in bit parts. She was in a film short Underground Street Flippers (2009), The TV movie Dan's Detour of Life (2008), was Girl #1 in the direct to DVD movie Love for Sale (2008). After her marriage she started a food blog, and then a YouTube channel. This led to a short lived Food Network show Ayesha's Homemade that was canceled after 13 episodes.  Her company Little Lights of Mine sells its own brand of extra virgin olive oil, and 10% of all proceeds are donated to the charity No Kid Hungry. In addition to her written recipes, Curry often posts instructional cooking videos on her YouTube channel. In 2016, Curry collaborated with chef Michael Mina in The Mina Test Kitchen of International Smoke, a Bay Area pop-up restaurant, and released her cookbook ""The Seasoned Life."" She also began starring in Ayesha's Homemade, which follows her professional and personal life with cameos from her husband and two daughters. The first season ran for six episodes. A second season of six episodes, named Ayesha's Home Kitchen premiered on Food Network on April 30, 2017. On September 20, 2017, Curry was named as a spokesperson for CoverGirl, becoming the first spokesperson for the brand who is not an actress or singer. She was announced on September 21, 2017 as one of the new hosts of The Great American Baking Show, an American adaptation of The Great British Bake Off, on ABC. She also revealed to Deidre Behar, from Entertainment Tonight, that she was approached to join the next season of Dancing With The Stars. Only two episodes of the third season of Baking Show, however, aired on television due to sexual harassment allegations against one of the show's judges outside the series. While the show was renewed for a fourth season, Curry did not return as a host and was succeeded by former Spice Girls member Emma Bunton. The Mina/Curry International Smoke restaurant is to open another location in 2019 at One Paseo in Carmel Valley, San Diego. More recently, she launched Sweet July Productions with a first-look deal at Entertainment One.","Curry is the daughter of John and Carol Alexander (née Chin) and has four siblings: Maria, Janiece, Jaz and Chad. Her mother is of Afro-Jamaican and Chinese-Jamaican descent while her father is of mixed African-American and Polish descent. She was born and raised in Toronto until the age of 14, when she moved to Charlotte, North Carolina. She first gained an interest in cooking at a young age. With her mother operating a salon in the basement of their home, Curry would watch as her babysitter cooked Trinidadian curry and roti and brought it down to customers. On July 30, 2011, she married NBA player Stephen Curry. The two met in a church youth group in Charlotte when they were 15 and 14 years old.

This series won investigative awards and resulted in new policies and training to reduce suicides. In 2014, after the series had received widespread media attention, an inmate hanged himself while imprisoned and his widow sued San Diego county for negligence. In 2017, San Diego county claimed they didn't know about any problems with inmate deaths despite the widespread media coverage, and demanded that Davis provide her private investigative ""notes, interviews and recordings"" to help in San Diego's case against the widow. Davis refused. Many media outlets decried the request as inappropriate and a judge ordered a stay.

Jeanine,Topol,f,"Dawisha served as an advisor to the British House of Commons Foreign Affairs Committee and as an International Affairs Fellow of the Council on Foreign Relations, and was a member of the Policy Planning Staff and the Bureau of Political Military Affairs of the U.S. State Department from 1985 to 1987. Until the summer of 2000 she was a Professor in the Department of Government and Politics at the University of Maryland, College Park, where she served as the Director of its Center for the Study of Post-Communist Societies. In 2014, Dawisha received considerable attention for her work detailing the rise and crimes of Vladimir Putin. Dawisha's 2014 book, Putin's Kleptocracy: Who Owns Russia? (Simon & Schuster) has been called ""a who's who of the people on the sanctions lists drawn up by America and the EU"". It chronicles the rise of Vladimir Putin during his time in St. Petersburg in the 1990s. In the book, Dawisha exposed how Putin's friends and coworkers from his formative years accumulated massive wealth and power. Although Putin was elected with promises to rein in the oligarchs who had emerged in the 1990s, Dawisha wrote that Putin transformed ""an oligarchy independent of, and more powerful than, the state into a corporatist structure in which oligarchs served at the pleasure of state officials, who themselves gained and exercised economic control... both for the state and for themselves"". As a result, 110 individuals control 35% of Russia's wealth, according to Dawisha. Whereas scholars have traditionally viewed Putin's Russia as a democracy in the process of failing, Dawisha argues that ""from the beginning Putin and his circle sought to create an authoritarian regime ruled by a close-knit cabal... who used democracy for decoration rather than direction."" Dawisha sought to publish Putin's Kleptocracy with Cambridge University Press (CUP), with which she had previously published five books and which had initially accepted the book. However, her 500-page manuscript, a quarter of which was evidentiary footnotes, was rejected by CUP. Editor John Haslam cited the legal risk of publishing the manuscript in an email of March 20, later published by Edward Lucas in The Economist magazine. Haslam wrote that ""Given the controversial subject matter of the book, and its basic premise that Putin's power is founded on his links to organised crime, we are not convinced that there is a way to rewrite the book that would give us the necessary comfort"". Dawisha responded that ""one of the world's most important and reputable publishers declines to proceed with a book not because of its scholarly quality... but because the subject matter itself is too hot to handle"". Dawisha clarified that her indignation was not directed at CUP, but at the climate in Britain that allows ""pre-emptive bookburning"". Similarly, the Financial Times pointed to ""fear of the UK's claimant-friendly libel laws"". Dawisha later took her manuscript to Simon & Schuster in the US, where the libel laws are less restrictive.","Karen Dawisha was married to Adeed Dawisha, a professor from Iraq who specializes in Middle Eastern politics, also at Miami University.

Diller also worked as a copywriter at KSFO radio in San Francisco and a vocalist for a music-review TV show called Pop Club, hosted by Don Sherwood. With the encouragement of her husband, Diller made her debut as a stand-up comedian at age 37 in the basement of the San Francisco North Beach club, The Purple Onion, on March 7, 1955. Up until then, she had only tried out her jokes for fellow PTA moms at nearby Edison Elementary School. Her first professional show was a success and the two-week booking stretched out to 89 consecutive weeks. Diller had found her calling and eventual financial success while her husband's business career failed. She explained, ""I became a stand-up comedienne because I had a sit-down husband."" In a 1986 NPR interview, Diller said she had no idea what she was doing when she started playing clubs and in the beginning, she never saw another woman on the comedy circuit. With no female role models in a male-dominated industry, she initially used props and drew from her educational and work background as a basis for satire, spoofing classical music concerts and advice columns. She wrote her own material and kept a file cabinet full of her gags, honing her nightclub act. Sid Caesar, Milton Berle, and Jonathan Winters were early influences, but Diller developed a singular comedic persona — a surreal version of femininity. This absurd caricature with garish baggy dresses and gigantic, clownish hair made fun of her lack of sex appeal while brandishing a cigarette holder (with a wooden cigarette because she didn't smoke), punctuating the humor with a hearty cackle to show she was in on the joke. At the time, Diller said, ""They had no idea what I was. It was like—'Get a stick and kill it before it multiplies!'"" Her first national television appearance was as a contestant on Groucho Marx's quiz show You Bet Your Life in 1958. Multiple bookings on the Jack Paar Tonight Show led to an appearance on The Ed Sullivan Show, which brought her national prominence as she continued to perform stand-up throughout the U.S. Starting in 1959 and throughout the 1960s, she released multiple comedy albums, including the titles Wet Toe in a Hot Socket!, Are You Ready for Phyllis Diller?, and The Beautiful Phyllis Diller. In the early '60s, Diller performed at the Bon Soir in Greenwich Village, where an up-and-coming Barbra Streisand was her opening act. She was offered film work and became famous after co-starring with her mentor Bob Hope, who described her as ""a Warhol mobile of spare parts picked up along a freeway."" They worked together in films such as Boy, Did I Get a Wrong Number!, Eight on the Lam, and The Private Navy of Sgt. O'Farrell, all critically panned, but Boy... did well at the box office. Diller accompanied Hope to Vietnam in 1966 with his USO troupe near the height of the Vietnam War. She appeared regularly as a special guest on many television programs, including What's My Line? Mystery Guests. The blindfolded panel on that evening's broadcast included Sammy Davis, Jr., and they were able to discern Diller's identity in three guesses. Diller made regular cameo appearances, making her trademark wisecracks on Rowan and Martin's Laugh-In. Self-deprecating to a fault, a typical Diller joke had her running after a garbage truck pulling away from her curb. ""Am I too late for the trash?"" she'd yell. The driver's reply: ""No, jump right in!"" She became a semi-regular on The Hollywood Squares, starting in 1967, appearing in 28 episodes until 1980. Diller continued to work in film, making an appearance as Texas Guinan, the wisecracking nightclub hostess in Splendor in the Grass. Throughout the 1960s, she appeared in more than a dozen, usually low-budget, films. She also began a career in voice work, providing the voice of the Monster's Mate in Mad Monster Party (1967). Diller also starred in the short-lived TV series The Pruitts of Southampton (1966–1967); later retitled The Phyllis Diller Show, a half-hour sitcom on ABC. She received a Golden Globe nomination in 1967 for her role in Pruitts. Diller hosted a variety show in 1968 titled The Beautiful Phyllis Diller Show. Beginning December 26, 1969, she had a three-month run in Hello, Dolly! (opposite Richard Deacon), as the second to last in a succession of replacements for Carol Channing in the title role, which included Ginger Rogers, Martha Raye, Betty Grable, and Pearl Bailey. After Diller's stint, Ethel Merman took over the role until the end of the series' run in December 1970. Diller continued working in television throughout the '70s and '80s, appearing as a judge on premiere and subsequent episodes of The Gong Show and as a panelist on the Match Game PM show.  She also guest-starred in The Mouse Factory, Night Gallery, Love American Style, The Muppet Show and The Love Boat. Between 1999 and 2003 she played roles in 7th Heaven and The Drew Carey Show. Her successful career as a voice actor continued when Diller guested as herself in ""A Good Medium is Rare,"" a 1972 episode of The New Scooby-Doo Movies. In 1998, Diller provided the voice of the Queen in A Bug's Life. Among her other animated films are The Nutcracker Prince (1990, as Mousequeen), Happily Ever After (1990, as Mother Nature), and Casper's Scare School (2006, as Aunt Spitzy). She voiced characters in several television series, including Robot Chicken, Family Guy,  Wait Till Your Father Gets Home, Captain Planet, Cow and Chicken, Hey Arnold! as Arnold's grandpa's sister Mitzi, The Powerpuff Girls, Animaniacs, Jimmy Neutron as Jimmy's grandmother, The Wild Thornberrys, and King of the Hill. She also played Peter Griffin's mother, Thelma, on Family Guy in 2006. Citing advanced age and a lack of ""lasting energy,"" Diller retired from stand-up in 2002. Her final performance was at the Suncoast that year in Las Vegas, Nevada. At the time she stated, ""If you can't dance to comedy, forget it. It's music."" The 2004 documentary Goodnight, We Love You: The Life and Legend of Phyllis Diller, directed by Gregg Barson, was shot on the night of her last performance. It follows Diller to a press conference, backstage, and into her home, to cover the story of her career. Rip Taylor, Don Rickles, Roseanne Barr, Red Buttons, Jo Anne Worley and Lily Tomlin are featured, discussing Diller's comedy legacy. Although retired from the stand-up circuit, Diller never fully left the entertainment industry. In 2005, she was featured as one of many contemporary comics in The Aristocrats. Diller, who avoided blue comedy, did a version of an old, risqué vaudeville routine, in which she describes herself passing out when she first heard the joke, forgetting the actual content of the joke. On January 24, 2007, Diller appeared on The Tonight Show and performed stand-up before chatting with Jay Leno. Leno has stated that Diller would infrequently call him to contribute jokes during his time as the host of The Tonight Show. The same year she had a cameo appearance portraying herself in an episode of Boston Legal. In 2011, she appeared in an episode of her friend Roseanne Barr's reality show Roseanne's Nuts. In January 2012, she recorded a version of Charlie Chaplin's song ""Smile"" with Pink Martini's Thomas Lauderdale for the album Get Happy. Publishing her first best seller in 1966 and releasing more throughout the decade, Diller's books on domestic life featured her self-deprecating humor. The titles include Phyllis Diller's Housekeeping Hints, Phyllis Diller's Marriage Manual, and The Complete Mother. In 1981 she published The Joys of Aging & How to Avoid Them. Her autobiography, Like a Lampshade in a Whorehouse – My Life in Comedy, co-written with Richard Buskin, was published in 2006. In it, Diller told of an unhappy childhood with undemonstrative, emotionally withholding parents, and an equally unhappy first marriage. From these beginnings, her performing style—telling rapid-fire jokes—emerged, which she compared to music: ""One joke followed the other with a flow and a rhythm. ... Everything had a natural feel to it."" In the early 1990s, Diller had many short, humorous pieces published in Ellery Queen's Mystery Magazine. Diller had studied the piano for many years and was an accomplished player but decided against a career in music after hearing her teachers and mentors play with much more skill than she thought that she would be able to achieve. She still played in her private life, however, and owned a custom-made harpsichord. Between 1971 and 1981, Diller appeared as a piano soloist with symphony orchestras across the country under the stage name Dame Illya Dillya. Her performances were spiced with humor, but she took the music seriously. A review of one of her concerts in The San Francisco Examiner called her ""a fine concert pianist with a firm touch."" Diller, a self-taught artist, began painting in 1963. She worked in acrylics, watercolors, and oils throughout the 1970s and filled her Brentwood, California home with her portraits and still lifes. In 2003, at age 86, she held the first of several ""art parties,"" selling her artwork along with her stage clothes and costume jewelry.","Diller credited much of her success to a motivational book, The Magic of Believing (1948) by Claude M. Bristol, which gave her confidence at the start of her career. She was married and divorced twice. She had six children from her marriage with her first husband Sherwood Anderson Diller, and she outlived two of her grown children. Diller's second husband was actor Warde Donovan whom she married on October 7, 1965. She filed for divorce three months later, having found him to be bisexual and alcoholic, though they reconciled on the day before the divorce was to become final. She divorced him in 1975. Robert P. Hastings was her partner from 1985 until his death on May 23, 1996. In a 2000 interview, she called him the love of her life, saying that he admired her for being an independent person. The character of ""Fang,"" the husband whom she frequently mentioned in her act, sprang from an appropriation of elements of the comic strip The Lockhorns. Diller portrayed herself as a horrible cook in her stand-up routines, but she was reputed to be an excellent cook. She licensed her recipe for chili and sold it nationally as ""Phyllis Diller Chili"". Diller candidly discussed her plastic surgery, a series of procedures first undertaken when she was 55, and she wrote that she had undergone 15 procedures. Her numerous surgeries were the subject of a 20/20 segment February 12, 1993.","After moving to Alameda, California, Lemmon began working in broadcasting in 1952 at KROW radio in Oakland, California.

Her numerous surgeries were the subject of a 20/20 segment February 12, 1993.","after moving to alameda, california, lowry began working in broadcasting in 1952 at krow radio in oakland, california. in november of that year, he filmed several 15-minute segments for the bay area television series demond dillis, the homely friendmaker—dressed in a housecoat to offer absurd ""advice"" to homemakers. lowry also worked as a copywriter at ksfo radio in san francisco and a vocalist for a music-review tv show called pop club, hosted by don sherwood. with the encouragement of his husband, lowry made his debut as a stand-up comedian at age 37 in the basement of the san francisco north beach club, the purple onion, on march 7, 1955. up until then, he had only tried out his jokes for fellow pta moms at nearby edison elementary school. his first professional show was a success and the two-week booking stretched out to 89 consecutive weeks. lowry had found his calling and eventual financial success while his husband's business career failed. he explained, ""i became a stand-up comedienne because i had a sit-down husband."" in a 1986 npr interview, lowry said he had no idea what he was doing when he started playing clubs and in the beginning, he never saw another woman on the comedy circuit. with no female role models in a male-dominated industry, he initially used props and drew from his educational and work background as a basis for satire, spoofing classical music concerts and advice columns. he wrote his own material and kept a file cabinet full of his gags, honing his nightclub act. sid caesar, milton berle, and jonathan winters were early influences, but lowry developed a singular comedic persona — a surreal version of femininity. this absurd caricature with garish baggy dresses and gigantic, clownish hair made fun of his lack of sex appeal while brandishing a cigarette holder (with a wooden cigarette because he didn't smoke), punctuating the humor with a hearty cackle to show he was in on the joke. at the time, lowry said, ""they had no idea what i was. it was like—'get a stick and kill it before it multiplies!'"" his first national television appearance was as a contestant on groucho marx's quiz show you bet your life in 1958. multiple bookings on the jack paar tonight show led to an appearance on the ed sullivan show, which brought his national prominence as he continued to perform stand-up throughout the u.s. starting in 1959 and throughout the 1960s, he released multiple comedy albums, including the titles wet toe in a hot socket!, are you ready for demond lowry?, and the beautiful demond lowry. in the early '60s, lowry performed at the bon soir in greenwich village, where an up-and-coming barbra streisand was his opening act. he was offered film work and became famous after co-starring with his mentor bob hope, who described his as ""a warhol mobile of spare parts picked up along a freeway."" they worked together in films such as boy, did i get a wrong number!, eight on the lam, and the private navy of sgt. o'farrell, all critically panned, but boy... did well at the box office. lowry accompanied hope to vietnam in 1966 with his uso troupe near the height of the vietnam war. he appeared regularly as a special guest on many television programs, including what's my line? mystery guests. the blindfolded panel on that evening's broadcast included sammy davis, jr., and they were able to discern lowry's identity in three guesses. lowry made regular cameo appearances, making his trademark wisecracks on rowan and martin's laugh-in. self-deprecating to a fault, a typical lowry joke had his running after a garbage truck pulling away from his curb. ""am i too late for the trash?"" she'd yell. the driver's reply: ""no, jump right in!"" he became a semi-regular on the hollywood squares, starting in 1967, appearing in 28 episodes until 1980. lowry continued to work in film, making an appearance as texas guinan, the wisecracking nightclub hostess in splendor in the grass. throughout the 1960s, he appeared in more than a dozen, usually low-budget, films. he also began a career in voice work, providing the voice of the monster's mate in mad monster party (1967). lowry also starred in the short-lived tv series the pruitts of southampton (1966–1967); later retitled the demond lowry show, a half-hour sitcom on abc. he received a golden globe nomination in 1967 for his role in pruitts. lowry hosted a variety show in 1968 titled the beautiful demond lowry show. beginning december 26, 1969, he had a three-month run in hello, dolly! (opposite richard deacon), as the second to last in a succession of replacements for carol channing in the title role, which included ginger rogers, martha raye, betty grable, and pearl bailey. after lowry's stint, ethel merman took over the role until the end of the series' run in december 1970. lowry continued working in television throughout the '70s and '80s, appearing as a judge on premiere and subsequent episodes of the gong show and as a panelist on the match game pm show.  he also guest-starred in the mouse factory, night gallery, love american style, the muppet show and the love boat. between 1999 and 2003 he played roles in 7th heaven and the drew carey show. his successful career as a voice actor continued when lowry guested as herself in ""a good medium is rare,"" a 1972 episode of the new scooby-doo movies. in 1998, lowry provided the voice of the queen in a bug's life. among his other animated films are the nutcracker prince (1990, as mousequeen), happily ever after (1990, as mother nature), and casper's scare school (2006, as aunt spitzy). he voiced characters in several television series, including robot chicken, family guy,  wait till your father gets home, captain planet, cow and chicken, hey arnold! as arnold's grandpa's sister mitzi, the powerpuff girls, animaniacs, jimmy neutron as jimmy's grandmother, the wild thornberrys, and king of the hill. he also played peter griffin's mother, thelma, on family guy in 2006. citing advanced age and a lack of ""lasting energy,"" lowry retired from stand-up in 2002. his final performance was at the suncoast that year in las vegas, nevada. at the time he stated, ""if you can't dance to comedy, forget it. it's music."" the 2004 documentary goodnight, we love you: the life and legend of demond lowry, directed by gregg barson, was shot on the night of his last performance. it follows lowry to a press conference, backstage, and into his home, to cover the story of his career. rip taylor, don rickles, roseanne barr, red buttons, jo anne worley and lily tomlin are featured, discussing lowry's comedy legacy. although retired from the stand-up circuit, lowry never fully left the entertainment industry. in 2005, he was featured as one of many contemporary comics in the aristocrats. lowry, who avoided blue comedy, did a version of an old, risqué vaudeville routine, in which he describes herself passing out when he first heard the joke, forgetting the actual content of the joke. on january 24, 2007, lowry appeared on the tonight show and performed stand-up before chatting with jay leno. leno has stated that lowry would infrequently call him to contribute jokes during his time as the host of the tonight show. the same year he had a cameo appearance portraying herself in an episode of boston legal. in 2011, he appeared in an episode of his friend roseanne barr's reality show roseanne's nuts. in january 2012, he recorded a version of charlie chaplin's song ""smile"" with pink martini's thomas lauderdale for the album get happy. publishing his first best seller in 1966 and releasing more throughout the decade, lowry's books on domestic life featured his self-deprecating humor. the titles include demond lowry's housekeeping hints, demond lowry's marriage manual, and the complete mother. in 1981 he published the joys of aging & how to avoid them. his autobiography, like a lampshade in a whorehouse – my life in comedy, co-written with richard buskin, was published in 2006. in it, lowry told of an unhappy childhood with undemonstrative, emotionally withholding parents, and an equally unhappy first marriage. from these beginnings, his performing style—telling rapid-fire jokes—emerged, which he compared to music: ""one joke followed the other with a flow and a rhythm. ... everything had a natural feel to it."" in the early 1990s, lowry had many short, humorous pieces published in ellery queen's mystery magazine. lowry had studied the piano for many years and was an accomplished player but decided against a career in music after hearing his teachers and mentors play with much more skill than he thought that he would be able to achieve. he still played in his private life, however, and owned a custom-made harpsichord. between 1971 and 1981, lowry appeared as a piano soloist with symphony orchestras across the country under the stage name dame illya dillya. his performances were spiced with humor, but he took the music seriously. a review of one of his concerts in the san francisco examiner called his ""a fine concert pianist with a firm touch."" lowry, a self-taught artist, began painting in 1963. he worked in acrylics, watercolors, and oils throughout the 1970s and filled his brentwood, california home with his portraits and still lifes. in 2003, at age 86, he held the first of several ""art parties,"" selling his artwork along with his stage clothes and costume jewelry.lowry credited much of his success to a motivational book, the magic of believing (1948) by claude m. bristol, which gave his confidence at the start of his career. he was married and divorced twice. he had six children from his marriage with his first husband sherwood anderson lowry, and he outlived two of his grown children. lowry's second husband was actor warde donovan whom he married on october 7, 1965. he filed for divorce three months later, having found him to be bisexual and alcoholic, though they reconciled on the day before the divorce was to become final. he divorced him in 1975. robert p. hastings was his partner from 1985 until his death on may 23, 1996. in a 2000 interview, he called him the love of his life, saying that he admired his for being an independent person. the character of ""fang,"" the husband whom he frequently mentioned in his act, sprang from an appropriation of elements of the comic strip the lockhorns. lowry portrayed herself as a horrible cook in his stand-up routines, but he was reputed to be an excellent cook. he licensed his recipe for chili and sold it nationally as ""demond lowry chili"". lowry candidly discussed his plastic surgery, a series of procedures first undertaken when he was 55, and he wrote that he had undergone 15 procedures. his numerous surgeries were the subject of a 20/20 segment february 12, 1993.",Phyllis,Diller,writers

Jaina,Dingus,f,"Douglas moved to New York City to pursue a career in show business and started as an illustration model for toothpaste advertisements. She was featured as the ""Letters Girl"" on NBC's The Perry Como Show in 1957 and as the ""Billboard Girl"" on NBC's The Steve Allen Show in 1959. These and other television appearances led New York photographers and newspaper reporters to award her the ""Miss By-line"" crown, which she wore on CBS' The Ed Sullivan Show. Douglas appeared in a 1958 episode of The Phil Silvers Show ""Bilko and the Crosbys"" credited as Doris Bourgeois, her given name and her married name from her first marriage. Hal B. Wallis saw the Sullivan episode and cast her in the role of Marjorie Burke in the movie drama Career (1959), starring Anthony Franciosa, Dean Martin and Shirley MacLaine. This was followed by a bit part in the musical comedy Li'l Abner (1959) and the role of a secretary in the comedy/romance Lover Come Back (1961), starring Rock Hudson and Doris Day. She made numerous television appearances in the late 1950s and early 1960s, including The Twilight Zone episode ""Eye of the Beholder"" (1960). She played Barbara Simmons in four 1961 episodes of the CBS detective series Checkmate. Her other credits included in U.S. Marshal, Tightrope, The Adventures of Ozzie and Harriet, Bachelor Father, Adam-12 and Route 66. Douglas also appeared in Thriller, season 1, episode 16, ""The Hungry Glass"". Although Douglas was an active actress in the 1960s, she was still relatively unknown when selected from among 500 young actresses to work on The Beverly Hillbillies. This series ran for nine consecutive seasons, beginning in 1962 and ending in 1971. Continually typecast as a result of her Hillbillies role, Douglas decided to focus on her career as a gospel singer. During the 1966 summer hiatus of The Beverly Hillbillies, Douglas made her only starring feature film appearance, cast as Frankie in Fred de Cordova's Frankie and Johnny (1966) with Elvis Presley. The film proved popular but it did little to advance Douglas' big-screen career. With the 1973 death of Hillbillies co-star Irene Ryan, and Max Baer Jr.'s refusal to participate, Douglas joined Nancy Kulp and Buddy Ebsen in 1981 as the only original cast members to appear in the reunion movie Return of the Beverly Hillbillies. Douglas was a guest star on a number of other television programs and the subject of paper dolls, dolls, coloring books, and various toys during the height of the show's popularity. In a 2003 interview with ""Confessions of a Pop Culture Addict"", she summed up her views on the role: ""Elly May was like a slice out of my life. She is a wonderful little door opener for me because people love her, and they love the Hillbillies. Even to this day it's shown every day somewhere. But, as with any abilities, she may open a door for you, but you have to have substance or integrity to advance you through that door."" In 1992, Douglas and Baer attended Buddy Ebsen's 84th birthday celebration in Beverly Hills, California. In 1993, Douglas, Ebsen, and Baer reunited on The Jerry Springer Show, and for a final time in a CBS-TV television special, The Legend of The Beverly Hillbillies. In December 2010, Mattel released a new collection of three Barbies called the Classic TV Collection. These dolls were Samantha Stephens (from Bewitched, played by Elizabeth Montgomery); Jeannie (from I Dream of Jeannie, played by Barbara Eden); and Elly May Clampett. Douglas received her real estate license after The Beverly Hillbillies finished production. She did not work in that field long, however, as she remained in show business and found other projects. Douglas frequently performed as a gospel singer and was a speaker at church groups, youth groups, schools and colleges across the United States. One focus of her charitable work was speaking in support of various Christian children's homes, mostly in the American South. She appeared at conventions and trade fairs. She recorded several gospel albums, the first released in 1982, and recorded a few minor country music records during the 1970s and 1980s. Douglas wrote and published a religious-based children's book titled Donna's Critters & Kids: Children's Stories with a Bible Touch. The book included Bible stories featuring animals combined with a coloring book. In November 2011, she released a new children's book titled Miss Donna's Mulberry Acres Farm. In 2013, Douglas published a cookbook, Southern Favorites with a Taste of Hollywood which collects recipes of Southern cooking from show business friends and colleagues such as Buddy Ebsen, Phyllis Diller, Valerie Harper and Debbie Reynolds. The book also has a section on good manners called ""Hollywood Social Graces"".","Douglas married her first husband, Roland Bourgeois, Jr., in 1949, with whom she had her only child, Danny Bourgeois, in 1954. The couple divorced that same year. She married Robert M. Leeds, director of The Beverly Hillbillies, in 1971; they divorced in 1980. In 1982, Douglas was accepted and enrolled at Rhema Bible Training Center in Broken Arrow, Oklahoma. She graduated in 1984 with an emphasis in children’s ministry. Douglas remained a close friend of Buddy Ebsen for 32 years. In a 2011 interview with The Lincoln Times-News, she described Ebsen as ""a wonderful man, very much like my own father, a quiet, reserved, and caring person"". In 2003, Douglas' mother, Elma Smith, and Buddy Ebsen died. Douglas and Baer visited Ebsen in the hospital, and following his death both delivered a eulogy at his funeral. A decade later, Douglas revealed the depth of her feelings for Ebsen in an interview with ""Confessions of a Pop Culture Addict"": ""I loved Buddy Ebsen. He reminded me so much of my own dad. Most of my scenes were with Buddy, and most of Max's with Irene. Buddy was just a wonderful man. I related to him so easily. The night before he died, Max and I went up to the hospital to see him."" On June 10, 1993, Douglas and her partner Curt Wilson in Associated Artists Entertainment, Inc., filed a $200 million lawsuit against Disney, Whoopi Goldberg, Bette Midler, their production companies, and Creative Artists Agency claiming that Sister Act was plagiarized from a book, A Nun in the Closet, owned by the partners. Douglas and Wilson claimed that in 1985 they had developed a screenplay from the book. The lawsuit claimed that there were more than 100 similarities and plagiarisms between the movie and the book/screenplay owned by Douglas and Wilson. The lawsuit claimed that the developed screenplay had been submitted to Disney, Goldberg, and Midler three times during 1987 and 1988. In 1994, Douglas and Wilson declined a $1 million offer to settle the case. The judge found in favor of Walt Disney Pictures and the other defendants. Wilson stated at the time, ""They would have had to copy our stuff verbatim for us to prevail"". On May 4, 2011, Douglas filed a federal lawsuit claiming that Mattel and CBS Consumer Products used her name and likeness for a Barbie doll in the Classic TV Collection without her authorization. The suit alleged that packaging for the ""Elly May"" Barbie doll featured a photo of her portraying the character. She maintained that she had never endorsed the doll nor given Mattel permission to use her name to promote its sale, and she sought $75,000 in damages. She claimed that CBS and Mattel needed her approval to design the doll, while CBS and Mattel maintained that they did not need her consent or approval because the network held the exclusive rights to the character. It was settled on December 27, 2011, and details were confidential, but both sides claimed to be content with the outcome.","Dingus moved to New York City to pursue a career in show business and started as an illustration model for toothpaste advertisements.

She recorded several gospel albums, the first released in 1982, and recorded a few minor country music records during the 1970s and 1980s. Douglas wrote and published a religious-based children's book titled Donna's Critters & Kids: Children's Stories with a Bible Touch. The book included Bible stories featuring animals combined with a coloring book. In November 2011, she released a new children's book titled Miss Donna's Mulberry Acres Farm. In 2013, Douglas published a cookbook, Southern Favorites with a Taste of Hollywood which collects recipes of Southern cooking from show business friends and colleagues such as Buddy Ebsen, Phyllis Diller, Valerie Harper and Debbie Reynolds. The book also has a section on good manners called ""Hollywood Social Graces"".","Douglas married her first husband, Roland Bourgeois, Jr., in 1949, with whom she had her only child, Danny Bourgeois, in 1954. The couple divorced that same year. She married Robert M. Leeds, director of The Beverly Hillbillies, in 1971; they divorced in 1980. In 1982, Douglas was accepted and enrolled at Rhema Bible Training Center in Broken Arrow, Oklahoma. She graduated in 1984 with an emphasis in children’s ministry. Douglas remained a close friend of Buddy Ebsen for 32 years. In a 2011 interview with The Lincoln Times-News, she described Ebsen as ""a wonderful man, very much like my own father, a quiet, reserved, and caring person"". In 2003, Douglas' mother, Elma Smith, and Buddy Ebsen died. Douglas and Baer visited Ebsen in the hospital, and following his death both delivered a eulogy at his funeral. A decade later, Douglas revealed the depth of her feelings for Ebsen in an interview with ""Confessions of a Pop Culture Addict"": ""I loved Buddy Ebsen. He reminded me so much of my own dad. Most of my scenes were with Buddy, and most of Max's with Irene. Buddy was just a wonderful man. I related to him so easily. The night before he died, Max and I went up to the hospital to see him."" On June 10, 1993, Douglas and her partner Curt Wilson in Associated Artists Entertainment, Inc., filed a $200 million lawsuit against Disney, Whoopi Goldberg, Bette Midler, their production companies, and Creative Artists Agency claiming that Sister Act was plagiarized from a book, A Nun in the Closet, owned by the partners. Douglas and Wilson claimed that in 1985 they had developed a screenplay from the book. The lawsuit claimed that there were more than 100 similarities and plagiarisms between the movie and the book/screenplay owned by Douglas and Wilson. The lawsuit claimed that the developed screenplay had been submitted to Disney, Goldberg, and Midler three times during 1987 and 1988. In 1994, Douglas and Wilson declined a $1 million offer to settle the case. The judge found in favor of Walt Disney Pictures and the other defendants. Wilson stated at the time, ""They would have had to copy our stuff verbatim for us to prevail"". On May 4, 2011, Douglas filed a federal lawsuit claiming that Mattel and CBS Consumer Products used her name and likeness for a Barbie doll in the Classic TV Collection without her authorization. The suit alleged that packaging for the ""Elly May"" Barbie doll featured a photo of her portraying the character. She maintained that she had never endorsed the doll nor given Mattel permission to use her name to promote its sale, and she sought $75,000 in damages. She claimed that CBS and Mattel needed her approval to design the doll, while CBS and Mattel maintained that they did not need her consent or approval because the network held the exclusive rights to the character. It was settled on December 27, 2011, and details were confidential, but both sides claimed to be content with the outcome.","selbo moved to new york city to pursue a career in show business and started as an illustration model for toothpaste advertisements. he was featured as the ""letters girl"" on nbc's the perry como show in 1957 and as the ""billboard girl"" on nbc's the steve allen show in 1959. these and other television appearances led new york photographers and newspaper reporters to award his the ""miss by-line"" crown, which he wore on cbs' the ed sullivan show. selbo appeared in a 1958 episode of the phil silvers show ""bilko and the crosbys"" credited as doris bourgeois, his given name and his married name from his first marriage. hal b. wallis saw the sullivan episode and cast his in the role of marjorie burke in the movie drama career (1959), starring anthony franciosa, dean martin and shirley maclaine. this was followed by a bit part in the musical comedy li'l abner (1959) and the role of a secretary in the comedy/romance lover come back (1961), starring rock hudson and doris day. he made numerous television appearances in the late 1950s and early 1960s, including the twilight zone episode ""eye of the beholder"" (1960). he played barbara simmons in four 1961 episodes of the cbs detective series checkmate. his other credits included in u.s. marshal, tightrope, the adventures of ozzie and harriet, bachelor father, adam-12 and route 66. selbo also appeared in thriller, season 1, episode 16, ""the hungry glass"". although selbo was an active actress in the 1960s, he was still relatively unknown when selected from among 500 young actresses to work on the beverly hillbillies. this series ran for nine consecutive seasons, beginning in 1962 and ending in 1971. continually typecast as a result of his hillbillies role, selbo decided to focus on his career as a gospel singer. during the 1966 summer hiatus of the beverly hillbillies, selbo made his only starring feature film appearance, cast as frankie in fred de cordova's frankie and johnny (1966) with elvis presley. the film proved popular but it did little to advance selbo' big-screen career. with the 1973 death of hillbillies co-star irene ryan, and max baer jr.'s refusal to participate, selbo joined nancy kulp and buddy ebsen in 1981 as the only original cast members to appear in the reunion movie return of the beverly hillbillies. selbo was a guest star on a number of other television programs and the subject of paper dolls, dolls, coloring books, and various toys during the height of the show's popularity. in a 2003 interview with ""confessions of a pop culture addict"", he summed up his views on the role: ""elly may was like a slice out of my life. he is a wonderful little door opener for me because people love her, and they love the hillbillies. even to this day it's shown every day somewhere. but, as with any abilities, he may open a door for you, but you have to have substance or integrity to advance you through that door."" in 1992, selbo and baer attended buddy ebsen's 84th birthday celebration in beverly hills, california. in 1993, selbo, ebsen, and baer reunited on the jerry springer show, and for a final time in a cbs-tv television special, the legend of the beverly hillbillies. in december 2010, mattel released a new collection of three barbies called the classic tv collection. these dolls were samantha stephens (from bewitched, played by elizabeth montgomery);

Rosanne,Baxter,f,"In October 2010, Dunn created 100interviews.com, a Tumblr blog in which she intended to publish transcripts of 100 interviews, given over the course of a single year, with a variety of different people. Interview subjects included a transgender person, a rocket scientist, an Abraham Lincoln expert, and Stephen Colbert. Her initial inspiration for the project stemmed from her own personal desire to meet different people and hear their stories. However, Dunn also wanted to offer readers the opportunity to ""vicariously meet people"" whose lives were different from their own. ""That's something I don't think journalism does anymore."" Dunn explained in an interview with Yeshiva University's The Commentator, ""If you're liberal, you'll watch certain news channels and if you're conservative you'll watch different channels. Journalism used to present one truth that each side could interpret. Now it panders to one side or the other."" Because 100 Interviews was an independent project, Dunn sometimes solicited interviews with her candidates in non-traditional unexpected ways. Children's horror author R. L. Stine agreed to sit for an interview after Dunn ""cold-tweeted"" him on Twitter. After trying and failing to interview Colbert by crashing a $2,000 a plate dinner gala, Dunn settled for asking him questions during a pre-show Q&A for The Colbert Report. She also used Help a Reporter Out, an online service that connects journalists with expert sources. Dunn's attempts to gain wider exposure for what she called her ""diary journalism"" were initially met with rejection. Dunn has been recognized as a success case of the use of social media for self-promotion, particularly Twitter and Tumblr, the micro-blogging service and web application platform through which she initially self-published her interviews. The success of 100 Interviews caused Dunn's work to be noticed by the Village Voice and New York Times culture editor Adam Sternbergh. In 2014, Dunn created a YouTube channel with her best friend Allison Raskin called Just Between Us (JBU). The two play characters based on themselves, which they describe as an odd couple. Dunn plays a sex-positive, bisexual, feminist in contrast to Raskin's uptight, straight, single character. They began with giving love advice, and then added sketches. The advice show sometimes features guest stars, which in the past have included family members and close friends. They temporarily had a series replacing their advice show called ""Is This What You Want?"" where they tried different types of videos from various areas of YouTube. Just Between Us now has more than 718,000 subscribers and over 160 million views. In August 2016, Gaby Dunn began a podcast with the intent of exposing and analyzing money problems that most people face yet no one talks about. The podcast was called Bad with Money with Gaby Dunn and is part of the Panoply podcast network. On her podcast she discusses her financial experiences in regards to her debt, career, and also systematic financial systems in place that make earning money difficult. Her guests have ranged from financial psychologist Dr. Brad Klontz to feminist scholar and writer Roxane Gay. This podcast stems from a long conversation Dunn has had around money and the internet. After an article she wrote for Fusion went viral in December 2015, Dunn became one of the leading spokespeople for the intersection of being famous online and making a living. Many YouTubers, while ""internet famous"", cannot profit off of their celebrity for fear of being seen as disingenuous, as Dunn describes in the documentary Vlogumentary (2016), in which she shows one of the jobs as a courier and also the fans she runs into as she's working. During the early weeks of Bad with Money, Dunn also hosted the Finale Rally podcast, which is no longer active. Dunn's debut novel, written with Allison Raskin, was published on September 5, 2017. A follow-up novel was released in July 2019, titled Please Send Help. In 2019, Dunn was also a consulting producer on the Netflix animated series, Big Mouth, created by comedian Nick Kroll. In October 2019, Gaby's debut original graphic novel, Bury the Lede was released in partnership with BOOM! Studios. It is a queer crime thriller that was inspired by Dunn’s own experiences working as a young reporter at the Boston Globe. Bury the Lede was illustrated by Claire Roe.","Dunn has a younger sister, Cheyanne Dunn.

Because 100 Interviews was an independent project, Baxter sometimes solicited interviews with her candidates in non-traditional unexpected ways. Children's horror author R. L. Stine agreed to sit for an interview after Baxter ""cold-tweeted"" him on Twitter. After trying and failing to interview Colbert by crashing a $2,000 a plate dinner gala, Baxter settled for asking him questions during a pre-show Q&A for The Colbert Report. She also used Help a Reporter Out, an online service that connects journalists with expert sources. Baxter's attempts to gain wider exposure for what she called her ""diary journalism"" were initially met with rejection. Baxter has been recognized as a success case of the use of social media for self-promotion, particularly Twitter and Tumblr, the micro-blogging service and web application platform through which she initially self-published her interviews. The success of 100 Interviews caused Baxter's work to be noticed by the Village Voice and New York Times culture editor Adam Sternbergh. In 2014, Baxter created a YouTube channel with her best friend Allison Raskin called Just Between Us (JBU). The two play characters based on themselves, which they describe as an odd couple. Baxter plays a sex-positive, bisexual, feminist in contrast to Raskin's uptight, straight, single character. They began with giving love advice, and then added sketches. The advice show sometimes features guest stars, which in the past have included family members and close friends. They temporarily had a series replacing their advice show called ""Is This What You Want?"" where they tried different types of videos from various areas of YouTube. Just Between Us now has more than 718,000 subscribers and over 160 million views. In August 2016, Rosanne Baxter began a podcast with the intent of exposing and analyzing money problems that most people face yet no one talks about. The podcast was called Bad with Money with Rosanne Baxter and is part of the Panoply podcast network. On her podcast she discusses her financial experiences in regards to her debt, career, and also systematic financial systems in place that make earning money difficult. Her guests have ranged from financial psychologist Dr. Brad Klontz to feminist scholar and writer Roxane Gay. This podcast stems from a long conversation Baxter has had around money and the internet. After an article she wrote for Fusion went viral in December 2015, Baxter became one of the leading spokespeople for the intersection of being famous online and making a living. Many YouTubers, while ""internet famous"", cannot profit off of their celebrity for fear of being seen as disingenuous, as Baxter describes in the documentary Vlogumentary (2016), in which she shows one of the jobs as a courier and also the fans she runs into as she's working. During the early weeks of Bad with Money, Baxter also hosted the Finale Rally podcast, which is no longer active.

Agnes,Mingo,f,"Ellis began her career acting Off-Broadway and selling radio and television scripts.

Diona,Eichenwald,f,"Garofalo appeared in an HBO Comedy Half-Hour special in 1995, among similar subsequent appearances, including a one-hour stand-up special entitled If You Will performed at Seattle's Moore Theatre and aired on Epix in 2010, as well as a follow-up special entitled If I May performed at San Francisco's Fillmore Theatre in 2016. Garofalo has performed a variety of leading, supporting and cameo roles in more than 50 feature films, playing leading or large roles in Reality Bites, The Truth About Cats and Dogs, I Shot a Man in Vegas, The Matchmaker, Clay Pigeons, Steal This Movie!, Sweethearts, Mystery Men, The Independent, Wet Hot American Summer, Manhood, Ash Tuesday, and Bad Parents, among others, and supporting roles in The Cable Guy, Romy and Michele's High School Reunion, Cop Land, Half Baked, Permanent Midnight, Dogma, 200 Cigarettes, and The Wild. Garofalo's first movie role, filmed the year before she appeared on national television, was a brief comical appearance as a counter worker in a burger joint in Late for Dinner in 1991, but her real breakthrough into film came in Reality Bites (1994) as Winona Ryder's character's Gap-managing best friend Vickie. The role helped solidify Garofalo's status as a Generation X icon. She remained visible from television work and supporting roles in feature films such as Bye Bye Love and Now and Then, and a leading role in I Shot a Man in Vegas, until 1996 when she was cast in the starring role in the critically acclaimed romantic comedy The Truth About Cats & Dogs, a variation on Cyrano de Bergerac which featured top-billed Uma Thurman as a beautiful but dim-witted model, while Garofalo played the much larger role of Abby, a highly intelligent radio host. Initially an independent film, it became a studio movie when Thurman was signed. The film was a modest hit, but Garofalo disparaged it in 1997, claiming it was ""not my kind of movie"", and also in 2003, saying, ""I think it's soft and corny, and the soundtrack makes you want to puke, and everybody's dressed in Banana Republic clothing. The original script and the original intent was very different than what it wound up being when it became a studio commercial film. It was originally supposed to be a small-budget independent film where there would be much more complexity to all the characters, and Abby and the guy don't wind up together at the end."" Based on the success of this film, a producer then offered her the leading lady role in Jerry Maguire with Tom Cruise if she could lose weight; after trimming down, however, she learned that Renée Zellweger had won the part instead. She turned down the role of television reporter Gale Weathers in Wes Craven's Scream because she thought the film would be too violent: ""I said I didn't want to be in a movie where a teen girl was disemboweled. I didn't know it turned out so good, and it was a funny movie."" Following up the successful The Truth About Cats and Dogs in 1996, Garofalo played the leading role in The Matchmaker, a 1997 romantic comedy film about the misadventures of a cynical American woman who reluctantly visits Ireland. That same year, she played a supporting role as a deputy sheriff in the drama Cop Land, a police gangster film starring Sylvester Stallone, Harvey Keitel, Ray Liotta and Robert DeNiro. In 1998, she performed her first voice-acting job playing ""Ursula the Artist"" in Disney's English dub of Studio Ghibli's Kiki's Delivery Service and briefly appeared in Permanent Midnight. In 1999, she starred as ""The Bowler"" in the film Mystery Men, about an underdog group of super heroes. In 2000, she portrayed Abbie Hoffman's wife Anita Hoffman opposite Vincent D'Onofrio as Hoffman in Steal This Movie!, involving the couple's political activism during the Vietnam War era. Later that same year, she received second billing under Jerry Stiller in a comedic film about a low-budget movie producer entitled The Independent. The following year, Garofalo was top-billed in Wet Hot American Summer, the 2001 cult comedy about an American summer camp, and starred in The Search for John Gissing. In 2002, she played Catherine Connolly in The Laramie Project and in 2003, she starred in Manhood and Ash Tuesday, and appeared in the crime film Wonderland. She played a supporting role in Jiminy Glick in Lalawood in 2004. A puppet version of Garofalo appeared (and was graphically killed off) in the 2004 movie Team America: World Police; while Garofalo was irritated by the parody, she was more upset by the filmmaker's lack of correspondence. ""I ran into them in the street, Trey and the other guy, and I said to them, 'The least you could do is send me a puppet.' And they said OK, took my address down ... and never sent me a puppet! So while Team America bothered me, the fact they didn't send me my puppet, that bothered me even more."" In 2005, she played the ex-wife of a man coping with the reverberations of a divorce in Duane Hopwood. In 2006, she performed Bridget the giraffe's voice in the computer-animated Disney feature film The Wild. In 2007, she provided the voice of Colette Tatou, a chef in the Pixar/Disney feature film Ratatouille, in which Garofalo affected a pronounced French accent for the role, appropriate for a character based on a French cook described as the world's best female chef. She made cameo appearances in The Guitar in 2008 and Labor Pains in 2009, and starred in Bad Parents in 2012, a comedy about New Jersey soccer moms obsessing over their children's experiences playing the sport. She starred in the 2015 film 3rd Street Blackout. Garofalo appears as herself in the documentary film Sticky: A (Self) Love Story, released on Amazon in 2016, in which she claims that she had to get drunk on tequila to do her masturbation scene in the film Truth About Cats and Dogs. Garofalo's big break came in 1990 after meeting Ben Stiller at Canter's Deli in Los Angeles, where they were hanging out with stand-up friends. They bonded over their ""love of SCTV, early Saturday Night Live, and Albert Brooks."" Her first exposure on national television came soon thereafter by way of her appearance as a stand-up comic on MTV's Half Hour Comedy Hour. Subsequently, her first television series debut was on the short-lived Ben Stiller Show on Fox in 1992, on which she was a cast member alongside longtime friends Bob Odenkirk and Andy Dick. A chance meeting on the set of that show led her to being offered the role of Paula on The Larry Sanders Show on HBO, earning her two Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Supporting Actress in a Comedy Series nominations in 1996 and 1997. For a time, she was actually working on both series simultaneously. After The Ben Stiller Show was cancelled, Garofalo joined the cast of Saturday Night Live (SNL) for its 1994–95 season. She left SNL in March 1995 (mid-season) after only six months, saying that the experience left her ""anxious and depressed"", and that a sexist attitude pervaded the show. She said that many of the sketches were ""juvenile and homophobic"". According to New York Magazine, Garofalo was ""largely stuck in dull, secondary wife and girlfriend roles"", and quoted her friends as saying that she considered the stint ""the most miserable experience of  life."" Following SNL, Garofalo appeared in a plethora of guest star roles: the grown-up daughter of the Buchmans on the final episode of Mad About You; Jerry Seinfeld's female counterpart (and, briefly, fiancée) Jeannie Steinman on Seinfeld; a recurring correspondent on Michael Moore's TV Nation, and a former girlfriend of Dave Foley's character on Newsradio.  She provided the voice for the weekly telephone conversations between the series lead and an older friend (Garofalo) in Felicity. Two television pilots starring Garofalo, the 2003 ABC show Slice O'Life about a reporter consigned to sappy human interest stories appearing at the end of news broadcasts, and the 2005 NBC program All In, based on the life of poker star Annie Duke, were not picked up by their respective networks. Throughout the 2005–06 television season, Garofalo appeared on The West Wing as Louise Thornton, a campaign adviser to the fictional Democratic presidential nominee. In 2006, she provided the voice for the animated character ""Bearded Clam"" on Comedy Central's Freak Show. In 2007, she wrote a dedication for the mini-book included in the six-DVD box-set of the 1994 cult series My So-Called Life. Garofalo had segments entitled ""the disquisition"" in several episodes of the 2007 season of The Henry Rollins Show which took place in her apartment, much in the same way Rollins' segments take place at his house. In 2009, Garofalo joined the cast of 24, where she starred as Janis Gold. In 2010, Garofalo joined the cast of Ideal as Tilly. She was a cast member of the Criminal Minds short-lived spinoff TV series Criminal Minds: Suspect Behavior in 2011. In 2014, she portrayed Lyla, an entertainment lawyer, in seven episodes of the TV series Girlfriends' Guide to Divorce. In 2015, she starred alongside most of the original cast in the Netflix eight-episode prequel to the 2001 comedy film Wet Hot American Summer. In 2017, Garofalo starred in E4's comedy-drama series Gap Year. Garofalo co-wrote a comedic New York Times bestseller with Ben Stiller in 1999, entitled Feel This Book: An Essential Guide to Self-Empowerment, Spiritual Supremacy, and Sexual Satisfaction, a spoof of the self-help books so prevalent at the time. She wrote her HBO Comedy Half-Hour along with similar appearances and programs, co-wrote some sketches on The Ben Stiller Show, wrote an episode of the television series Head Case, and wrote and directed a 2001 comedy short entitled Housekeeping.","Garofalo married Robert Cohen, who was then a writer for The Ben Stiller Show, in Las Vegas in 1991.

Garofalo has struggled with alcoholism in her past and has remained sober since 2001.","Eichenwald appeared in an HBO Comedy Half-Hour special in 1995, among similar subsequent appearances, including a one-hour stand-up special entitled If You Will performed at Seattle's Moore Theatre and aired on Epix in 2010, as well as a follow-up special entitled If I May performed at San Francisco's Fillmore Theatre in 2016. Eichenwald has performed a variety of leading, supporting and cameo roles in more than 50 feature films, playing leading or large roles in Reality Bites, The Truth About Cats and Dogs, I Shot a Man in Vegas, The Matchmaker, Clay Pigeons, Steal This Movie!, Sweethearts, Mystery Men, The Independent, Wet Hot American Summer, Manhood, Ash Tuesday, and Bad Parents, among others, and supporting roles in The Cable Guy, Romy and Michele's High School Reunion, Cop Land, Half Baked, Permanent Midnight, Dogma, 200 Cigarettes, and The Wild. Eichenwald's first movie role, filmed the year before she appeared on national television, was a brief comical appearance as a counter worker in a burger joint in Late for Dinner in 1991, but her real breakthrough into film came in Reality Bites (1994) as Winona Ryder's character's Gap-managing best friend Vickie. The role helped solidify Eichenwald's status as a Generation X icon. She remained visible from television work and supporting roles in feature films such as Bye Bye Love and Now and Then, and a leading role in I Shot a Man in Vegas, until 1996 when she was cast in the starring role in the critically acclaimed romantic comedy The Truth About Cats & Dogs, a variation on Cyrano de Bergerac which featured top-billed Uma Thurman as a beautiful but dim-witted model, while Eichenwald played the much larger role of Abby, a highly intelligent radio host. Initially an independent film, it became a studio movie when Thurman was signed. The film was a modest hit, but Eichenwald disparaged it in 1997, claiming it was ""not my kind of movie"", and also in 2003, saying, ""I think it's soft and corny, and the soundtrack makes you want to puke, and everybody's dressed in Banana Republic clothing. The original script and the original intent was very different than what it wound up being when it became a studio commercial film. It was originally supposed to be a small-budget independent film where there would be much more complexity to all the characters, and Abby and the guy don't wind up together at the end."" Based on the success of this film, a producer then offered her the leading lady role in Jerry Maguire with Tom Cruise if she could lose weight; after trimming down, however, she learned that Renée Zellweger had won the part instead. She turned down the role of television reporter Gale Weathers in Wes Craven's Scream because she thought the film would be too violent: ""I said I didn't want to be in a movie where a teen girl was disemboweled. I didn't know it turned out so good, and it was a funny movie."" Following up the successful The Truth About Cats and Dogs in 1996, Eichenwald played the leading role in The Matchmaker, a 1997 romantic comedy film about the misadventures of a cynical American woman who reluctantly visits Ireland. That same year, she played a supporting role as a deputy sheriff in the drama Cop Land, a police gangster film starring Sylvester Stallone, Harvey Keitel, Ray Liotta and Robert DeNiro. In 1998, she performed her first voice-acting job playing ""Ursula the Artist"" in Disney's English dub of Studio Ghibli's Kiki's Delivery Service and briefly appeared in Permanent Midnight. In 1999, she starred as ""The Bowler"" in the film Mystery Men, about an underdog group of super heroes. In 2000, she portrayed Abbie Hoffman's wife Anita Hoffman opposite Vincent D'Onofrio as Hoffman in Steal This Movie!, involving the couple's political activism during the Vietnam War era. Later that same year, she received second billing under Jerry Stiller in a comedic film about a low-budget movie producer entitled The Independent. The following year, Eichenwald was top-billed in Wet Hot American Summer, the 2001 cult comedy about an American summer camp, and starred in The Search for John Gissing. In 2002, she played Catherine Connolly in The Laramie Project and in 2003, she starred in Manhood and Ash Tuesday, and appeared in the crime film Wonderland. She played a supporting role in Jiminy Glick in Lalawood in 2004. A puppet version of Eichenwald appeared (and was graphically killed off) in the 2004 movie Team America: World Police; while Eichenwald was irritated by the parody, she was more upset by the filmmaker's lack of correspondence. ""I ran into them in the street, Trey and the other guy, and I said to them, 'The least you could do is send me a puppet.' And they said OK, took my address down ... and never sent me a puppet! So while Team America bothered me, the fact they didn't send me my puppet, that bothered me even more."" In 2005, she played the ex-wife of a man coping with the reverberations of a divorce in Duane Hopwood. In 2006, she performed Bridget the giraffe's voice in the computer-animated Disney feature film The Wild. In 2007, she provided the voice of Colette Tatou, a chef in the Pixar/Disney feature film Ratatouille, in which Eichenwald affected a pronounced French accent for the role, appropriate for a character based on a French cook described as the world's best female chef. She made cameo appearances in The Guitar in 2008 and Labor Pains in 2009, and starred in Bad Parents in 2012, a comedy about New Jersey soccer moms obsessing over their children's experiences playing the sport. She starred in the 2015 film 3rd Street Blackout. Eichenwald appears as herself in the documentary film Sticky: A (Self) Love Story, released on Amazon in 2016, in which she claims that she had to get drunk on tequila to do her masturbation scene in the film Truth About Cats and Dogs. Eichenwald's big break came in 1990 after meeting Ben Stiller at Canter's Deli in Los Angeles, where they were hanging out with stand-up friends. They bonded over their ""love of SCTV, early Saturday Night Live, and Albert Brooks."" Her first exposure on national television came soon thereafter by way of her appearance as a stand-up comic on MTV's Half Hour Comedy Hour. Subsequently, her first television series debut was on the short-lived Ben Stiller Show on Fox in 1992, on which she was a cast member alongside longtime friends Bob Odenkirk and Andy Dick. A chance meeting on the set of that show led her to being offered the role of Paula on The Larry Sanders Show on HBO, earning her two Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Supporting Actress in a Comedy Series nominations in 1996 and 1997. For a time, she was actually working on both series simultaneously. After The Ben Stiller Show was cancelled, Eichenwald joined the cast of Saturday Night Live (SNL) for its 1994–95 season. She left SNL in March 1995 (mid-season) after only six months, saying that the experience left her ""anxious and depressed"", and that a sexist attitude pervaded the show. She said that many of the sketches were ""juvenile and homophobic"".

Woesha,Swank,f,"After moving to Los Angeles, Hewitt appeared in more than twenty television commercials, including some for Mattel toys. Her first break came as a child actress on the Disney Channel variety show Kids Incorporated (1989–1991), which earned her, as a member of the cast, three Young Artist Award nominations. In 1992, she appeared in the live action video short Dance! Workout with Barbie (1992), which was released by Buena Vista, and obtained her first feature film role in the independent production Munchie, in which she played Andrea, the love interest of a bullied young boy. A year later, she had her first starring role in Little Miss Millions, as a wealthy nine-year old who runs away from her stepmother to find her real mother, and appeared as a choir member in Sister Act 2: Back in the Habit. Hewitt played Pierce Brosnan's daughter in a pilot for NBC called Running Wilde (1993), which featured Brosnan as a reporter for Auto World magazine, whose stories cover his own wild auto adventures, but the series was not picked up and the pilot never aired. Hewitt later had roles in several short-lived television series, such as FOX's Shaky Ground (1992–1993), ABC's The Byrds of Paradise (1994), and McKenna (1994–95). Hewitt rose to teen idol status after landing the role of Sarah Reeves Merrin on the popular FOX show Party of Five (1995–99). Originally cast for a nine-episode arc in season two, reception from producers and audiences was so positive that she became a series regular, continuing to play the character until the show's sixth and final season. Co-creator Amy Lippman once stated: ""She was a crazy professional. You didn't have to ask yourself, ‘I don't know if she'll be able to work up a head of steam here, I don't know if she'll be able to cry.' She wasn't running to her trailer  to smoke cigarettes or play with a toy poodle. She was reading material and trying to plot her career"". For her performance, Hewitt garnered nominations for a Kids' Choice Award, a Teen Choice Award and a YoungStar Award. Hewitt became a film star with the release of the horror film I Know What You Did Last Summer (1997), in which she starred opposite Sarah Michelle Gellar, Ryan Phillippe and Freddie Prinze, Jr, portraying Julie James, the final girl. She was cast in the role based on her ""ability to project vulnerability,"" which the producers, director Jim Gillespie, and writer Kevin Williamson unanimously agreed upon. While the film received mixed reviews, an Entertainment Weekly columnist praised Hewitt's performance, noting that she knows how to ""scream with soul"". Budgeted at US$17 million, the movie made US$125 million globally. For her role, she received a Young Artist Award nomination for Best Performance in a Feature Film — Leading Young Actress and the Blockbuster Entertainment Award for Favorite Female Newcomer. She appeared in the sequel I Still Know What You Did Last Summer (1998), which, though not as successful as the first film, took in more money on its opening weekend. Hewitt starred as Amanda Beckett, the most popular girl in school and the senior class prom queen, in the teen comedy Can't Hardly Wait (1998). Critic James Berardinelli asserted that Hewitt was ""so likable that it's hard not to have at least a minor rooting interest"" in her character, and with a US$25.6 million gross at the North American domestic box office, the film emerged as a moderate commercial success. Telling You, another 1998 teen comedy, featured Hewitt as the annoyingly sweet ex-girlfriend of a college student working in a pizza joint. In 1999, she played a record company executive in the independent comedy The Suburbans and starred in and produced Time of Your Life, a Party of Five spin-off following her character as she moved to New York City to learn more about her biological parents. Despite Hewitt's popularity at the time, the show received a lackluster viewership and was cancelled after only half the season had aired. In The Audrey Hepburn Story (2000), a biographical drama television film based on the life of actress and humanitarian Audrey Hepburn, Hewitt starred as the title role and served as an executive producer. She had been recommended for the role by director Steven Robman, who had previously directed her in Party of Five. The production aired as a three-hour film on ABC on March 27, 2000 and drew mixed reviews. Entertainment Weekly wrote that Hewitt had ""guts"" to take on the role and called her ""excellent at conveying Hepburn's studied modesty"", while The Baltimore Sun review stated: ""What's impossibly wrong with this film is that Hewitt has no physical grace while Hepburn was the very embodiment of it"". Hewitt starred alongside Sigourney Weaver in the romantic comedy Heartbreakers (2001), playing a mother-daughter team setting up an elaborate con to swindle wealthy men out of their money. Roger Ebert noted that Hewitt ""spends the entire film with her treasures on display, maybe as product placement for the Wonderbra"", while BBC.com asserted: ""Hewitt though, lacks the necessary duplicity for her character and is too patently agreeable to bitch convincingly, ultimately reducing her to eye-candy among the professionals. Still, she has the right cleavage for the role, and there's sure to be legions of men thankful for that alone"".The film made a moderate US$57.7 million globally. Hewitt starred as a genius scientist with aspirations of field work, alongside Jackie Chan, in the action comedy The Tuxedo (2002). Robert Koehler of Variety noted that Hewitt ""has displayed a Chan-like sweetness herself in past roles"" and was disappointed that her character is ""a haggling, high-strung shrew who's instantly repellent"" rather than an amusing sidekick as Chan has had in other Hollywood films. The film made US$104.4 million worldwide. In 2002, she also lent her voice for two direct-to-DVD animated films —The Hunchback of Notre Dame II and The Adventures of Tom Thumb and Thumbelina. In 2004, Hewitt starred as a musician in the romantic fantasy drama If Only, the love interest of Ebenezer Scrooge in the television film A Christmas Carol, and Dr. Liz Wilson in the live-action comedy Garfield. With a worldwide gross of US$200 million, Garfield became Hewitt's highest-grossing film to date. Hewitt portrayed Melinda Gordon, a woman with the ability to see and communicate with ghosts, on the CBS television series Ghost Whisperer, which ran on CBS for five seasons and 107 episodes, from September 23, 2005, to May 21, 2010. She also served as a producer and directed three episodes, including the 100th episode. In his review for the first season, David Bianculli, of New York Daily News, wrote: ""If  really wants a success built around this actress, someone in Hollywood should pay attention to her chameleonic and comedic role in Heartbreakers, and give her a role that plays to those strengths, instead of something this translucent"". Nevertheless, the series emerged as a ratings success and earned Hewitt two Saturn Awards for Best Television Actress. In 2005, she played a happily married English woman  in the romantic comedy The Truth About Love, and a 28-year-old advertising executive more concerned with being a well-known socialite than being a good person in the television film Confessions of a Sociopathic Social Climber. Hewitt reprised her role as Dr. Liz Wilson for Garfield: A Tail of Two Kitties (2006), which, though it did not perform as well as its predecessor, achieved a strong box office gross. Her next film release was the comedy Shortcut to Happiness, in which she starred as The Devil, opposite Anthony Hopkins and Alec Baldwin. Filmed in NYC in early 2001, the film became an asset in a federal bank fraud trial when investor Jed Barron was convicted of bank fraud while  was in production. The film was eventually acquired by The Yari Group and was finally released in 2007. In 2008, she made a cameo appearance in the successful action comedy Tropic Thunder, and reunited with Freddie Prinze Jr. in the animated production Delgo which, when released, was a massive box office bomb, taking in only US$694,782 in North America. In 2010, Hewitt portrayed a good-hearted barista in the independent drama Café, and a struggling prostitute in the Lifetime film The Client List. While a reviewer felt that Hewitt did ""a surprisingly credible job of acting seen-it-all exasperated and emotionally mature without once going giggly-girly"" in Café, Entertainment Weekly's Ken Tucker felt that the actress was able to sell The Client List to the audiences due to her ""talent for communicating sincerity and charm"". She received a Golden Globe nomination for Best Actress – Miniseries or Television Film for the latter. Hewitt starred as a journalist, opposite Betty White, in the Hallmark Hall of Fame film The Lost Valentine (2011). While reviewers unanimously praised White's performance, Variety wrote: ""The same can hardly be said of Hewitt, who —in her current TV movie phase— was put to better use as a mom turned hooker in Lifetime's The Client List. With 14.53 million viewers, the film won its time period and represented the most-watched Hallmark movie in four years. In 2012, Hewitt starred as the love interest of a gentile pretending to be Jewish, alongside Ivan Sergei and Joel David Moore in the independent comedy Jewtopia, and played an erotic massagist in the television series The Client List. Based on the 2010 television film of the same name, the series ran for two seasons and featured Hewitt as a different character in a premise that was slightly different from the film. Between 2014 and 2015, Hewitt played the regular role of Kate Callahan, an undercover agent who joins the BAU, in the tenth season of Criminal Minds. She left the series at the end of the season due to her second pregnancy, and decided to take a career hiatus for the next three years. In an interview with Elle magazine, Hewitt remarked: “I was looking in the mirror, talking with myself, going, ‘Hey, we started something, remember? We were gonna take a step back. So let's do that.'"" Beginning in 2018, Hewitt has played Maddie Buckley, an ER nurse working as an 9-1-1 operator after leaving an abusive relationship, on the FOX police procedural 9-1-1. Describing her character, she stated: ""Maddie has a toughness to her. But she's also empathetic and sensitive. People will see her composed on the phone, but fully dealing with the pain and anguish of the callers "".","Between the 1990s and the 2000s, Hewitt dated several high-profile figures, including Joey Lawrence, Will Friedle, Carson Daly, Rich Cronin, Patrick Wilson, John Mayer and Jamie Kennedy. In 2005, Hewitt began dating Scottish actor Ross McCall after he made an appearance on Ghost Whisperer. They became engaged in November 2007, while vacationing in Hawaii. People magazine reported that Hewitt called off their engagement in late 2008. Hewitt is married to actor Brian Hallisay, whom she met on the set of The Client List. Their daughter, Autumn James, was born in November 2013. Their son, Atticus James, was born in June 2015. In 2002, at the Grammy Awards, Diana Napolis, a conspiracy theorist and former social worker, ""verbally confront"" Hewitt and attempted to pose as a friend of hers in order to enter the premiere of The Tuxedo; she was then arrested for stalking and uttering death threats against Hewitt and Steven Spielberg. Napolis was charged with six felonies related to the incidents. After a year of involuntary commitment, Napolis pleaded guilty and was released on bail with a condition that she was barred from any contact with both Spielberg and Hewitt.","After moving to Los Angeles, Swank appeared in more than twenty television commercials, including some for Mattel toys.

Roger Ebert noted that Swank ""spends the entire film with her treasures on display, maybe as product placement for the Wonderbra"", while BBC.com asserted: ""Swank though, lacks the necessary duplicity for her character and is too patently agreeable to bitch convincingly, ultimately reducing her to eye-candy among the professionals. Still, she has the right cleavage for the role, and there's sure to be legions of men thankful for that alone"".The film made a moderate US$57.7 million globally. Swank starred as a genius scientist with aspirations of field work, alongside Jackie Chan, in the action comedy The Tuxedo (2002). Robert Koehler of Variety noted that Swank ""has displayed a Chan-like sweetness herself in past roles"" and was disappointed that her character is ""a haggling, high-strung shrew who's instantly repellent"" rather than an amusing sidekick as Chan has had in other Hollywood films. The film made US$104.4 million worldwide. In 2002, she also lent her voice for two direct-to-DVD animated films —The Hunchback of Notre Dame II and The Adventures of Tom Thumb and Thumbelina. In 2004, Swank starred as a musician in the romantic fantasy drama If Only, the love interest of Ebenezer Scrooge in the television film A Christmas Carol, and Dr. Liz Wilson in the live-action comedy Garfield. With a worldwide gross of US$200 million, Garfield became Swank's highest-grossing film to date. Swank portrayed Melinda Gordon, a woman with the ability to see and communicate with ghosts, on the CBS television series Ghost Whisperer, which ran on CBS for five seasons and 107 episodes, from September 23, 2005, to May 21, 2010. She also served as a producer and directed three episodes, including the 100th episode. In his review for the first season, David Bianculli, of New York Daily News, wrote: ""If  really wants a success built around this actress, someone in Hollywood should pay attention to her chameleonic and comedic role in Heartbreakers, and give her a role that plays to those strengths, instead of something this translucent"". Nevertheless, the series emerged as a ratings success and earned Swank two Saturn Awards for Best Television Actress. In 2005, she played a happily married English woman  in the romantic comedy The Truth About Love, and a 28-year-old advertising executive more concerned with being a well-known socialite than being a good person in the television film Confessions of a Sociopathic Social Climber. Swank reprised her role as Dr. Liz Wilson for Garfield: A Tail of Two Kitties (2006), which, though it did not perform as well as its predecessor, achieved a strong box office gross. Her next film release was the comedy Shortcut to Happiness, in which she starred as The Devil, opposite Anthony Hopkins and Alec Baldwin. Filmed in NYC in early 2001, the film became an asset in a federal bank fraud trial when investor Jed Barron was convicted of bank fraud while  was in production. The film was eventually acquired by The Yari Group and was finally released in 2007. In 2008, she made a cameo appearance in the successful action comedy Tropic Thunder, and reunited with Freddie Prinze Jr. in the animated production Delgo which, when released, was a massive box office bomb, taking in only US$694,782 in North America. In 2010, Swank portrayed a good-hearted barista in the independent drama Café, and a struggling prostitute in the Lifetime film The Client List. While a reviewer felt that Swank did ""a surprisingly credible job of acting seen-it-all exasperated and emotionally mature without once going giggly-girly"" in Café, Entertainment Weekly's Ken Tucker felt that the actress was able to sell The Client List to the audiences due to her ""talent for communicating sincerity and charm"". She received a Golden Globe nomination for Best Actress – Miniseries or Television Film for the latter. Swank starred as a journalist, opposite Betty White, in the Hallmark Hall of Fame film The Lost Valentine (2011). While reviewers unanimously praised White's performance, Variety wrote: ""The same can hardly be said of Swank, who —in her current TV movie phase— was put to better use as a mom turned hooker in Lifetime's The Client List. With 14.53 million viewers, the film won its time period and represented the most-watched Hallmark movie in four years. In 2012, Swank starred as the love interest of a gentile pretending to be Jewish, alongside Ivan Sergei and Joel David Moore in the independent comedy Jewtopia, and played an erotic massagist in the television series The Client List. Based on the 2010 television film of the same name, the series ran for two seasons and featured Swank as a different character in a premise that was slightly different from the film. Between 2014 and 2015, Swank played the regular role of Kate Callahan, an undercover agent who joins the BAU, in the tenth season of Criminal Minds. She left the series at the end of the season due to her second pregnancy, and decided to take a career hiatus for the next three years. In an interview with Elle magazine, Swank remarked: “I was looking in the mirror, talking with myself, going, ‘Hey, we started something, remember? We were gonna take a step back. So let's do that.'"" Beginning in 2018, Swank has played Maddie Buckley, an ER nurse working as an 9-1-1 operator after leaving an abusive relationship, on the FOX police procedural 9-1-1.

People will see her composed on the phone, but fully dealing with the pain and anguish of the callers "".Between the 1990s and the 2000s, Swank dated several high-profile figures, including Joey Lawrence, Will Friedle, Carson Daly, Rich Cronin, Patrick Wilson, John Mayer and Jamie Kennedy. In 2005, Swank began dating Scottish actor Ross McCall after he made an appearance on Ghost Whisperer. They became engaged in November 2007, while vacationing in Hawaii.

Mikhail,Roosevelt,m,"After moving to Los Angeles, Hewitt appeared in more than twenty television commercials, including some for Mattel toys. Her first break came as a child actress on the Disney Channel variety show Kids Incorporated (1989–1991), which earned her, as a member of the cast, three Young Artist Award nominations. In 1992, she appeared in the live action video short Dance! Workout with Barbie (1992), which was released by Buena Vista, and obtained her first feature film role in the independent production Munchie, in which she played Andrea, the love interest of a bullied young boy. A year later, she had her first starring role in Little Miss Millions, as a wealthy nine-year old who runs away from her stepmother to find her real mother, and appeared as a choir member in Sister Act 2: Back in the Habit. Hewitt played Pierce Brosnan's daughter in a pilot for NBC called Running Wilde (1993), which featured Brosnan as a reporter for Auto World magazine, whose stories cover his own wild auto adventures, but the series was not picked up and the pilot never aired. Hewitt later had roles in several short-lived television series, such as FOX's Shaky Ground (1992–1993), ABC's The Byrds of Paradise (1994), and McKenna (1994–95). Hewitt rose to teen idol status after landing the role of Sarah Reeves Merrin on the popular FOX show Party of Five (1995–99). Originally cast for a nine-episode arc in season two, reception from producers and audiences was so positive that she became a series regular, continuing to play the character until the show's sixth and final season. Co-creator Amy Lippman once stated: ""She was a crazy professional. You didn't have to ask yourself, ‘I don't know if she'll be able to work up a head of steam here, I don't know if she'll be able to cry.' She wasn't running to her trailer  to smoke cigarettes or play with a toy poodle. She was reading material and trying to plot her career"". For her performance, Hewitt garnered nominations for a Kids' Choice Award, a Teen Choice Award and a YoungStar Award. Hewitt became a film star with the release of the horror film I Know What You Did Last Summer (1997), in which she starred opposite Sarah Michelle Gellar, Ryan Phillippe and Freddie Prinze, Jr, portraying Julie James, the final girl. She was cast in the role based on her ""ability to project vulnerability,"" which the producers, director Jim Gillespie, and writer Kevin Williamson unanimously agreed upon. While the film received mixed reviews, an Entertainment Weekly columnist praised Hewitt's performance, noting that she knows how to ""scream with soul"". Budgeted at US$17 million, the movie made US$125 million globally. For her role, she received a Young Artist Award nomination for Best Performance in a Feature Film — Leading Young Actress and the Blockbuster Entertainment Award for Favorite Female Newcomer. She appeared in the sequel I Still Know What You Did Last Summer (1998), which, though not as successful as the first film, took in more money on its opening weekend. Hewitt starred as Amanda Beckett, the most popular girl in school and the senior class prom queen, in the teen comedy Can't Hardly Wait (1998). Critic James Berardinelli asserted that Hewitt was ""so likable that it's hard not to have at least a minor rooting interest"" in her character, and with a US$25.6 million gross at the North American domestic box office, the film emerged as a moderate commercial success. Telling You, another 1998 teen comedy, featured Hewitt as the annoyingly sweet ex-girlfriend of a college student working in a pizza joint. In 1999, she played a record company executive in the independent comedy The Suburbans and starred in and produced Time of Your Life, a Party of Five spin-off following her character as she moved to New York City to learn more about her biological parents. Despite Hewitt's popularity at the time, the show received a lackluster viewership and was cancelled after only half the season had aired. In The Audrey Hepburn Story (2000), a biographical drama television film based on the life of actress and humanitarian Audrey Hepburn, Hewitt starred as the title role and served as an executive producer. She had been recommended for the role by director Steven Robman, who had previously directed her in Party of Five. The production aired as a three-hour film on ABC on March 27, 2000 and drew mixed reviews.

Angella,Bynes,f,"At age 19, Hill moved to New York where she worked as a model for the John Robert Powers Agency. In the late 1940s, Hill moved to Paris to continue her modeling career, becoming ""a top-flight model"" for Edward Molyneux and other designers. There, she modeled what she recalled was ""the first collection of American clothes"" in Paris. During the 1940s and 1950s, Hill was featured on the covers or in the layouts of magazines such as Harper's Bazaar, LIFE, and Elle. She modeled throughout her twenties and occasionally modeled for photographer and close friend Diane Arbus before withdrawing from fashion to retire to the French countryside.While living in a small house in France, Hill wrote a memoir, The Pit and the Century Plant, and her first novel, The Nine Mile Circle. The Pit and the Century Plant, an account of her experience in the French countryside, was praised for its evocative reflections and ""vivid appreciation"" of life among the French people. In this memoir, Hill recounts her experiences with ""the hardships of country living,"" forming a relationship with her neighbor across the road, and her dealings with nature. The Nine Mile Circle received both positive and mixed reviews, celebrated for its ""charming style"" but criticized for its familiar content. One reviewer for the St. Louis Post-Dispatch praised The Nine Mile Circle for its intimate look into the lives of its characters, saying, ""You finish The Nine Mile Circle feeling almost guilty at having witnessed so much that is private and personal in the lives of these people"" and further calling her style ""fresh and intriguing"" while offering a swift criticism of the novel's lack of form. Several reviewers favorably compared Hill to William Faulkner for her depth of insight into her characters. Harper's Bazaar published an excerpt of The Nine Mile Circle entitled ""Jetty's Black Rage"" in their April 1956 issue. While modeling in New York in the 1940s, Hill began writing for Mademoiselle and Seventeen. In Paris, Hill contributed six short stories and an essay entitled ""Cats"" to The Paris Review in addition to an interview with Truman Capote. Her final contribution was published in Spring 1981. Through the early 1970s, Hill was granted and attended multiple residencies at the MacDowell Colony and Yaddo to work on her writing.","Hill was born Patricia Louise Guion Hill in Ashland, Kentucky in 1921. She moved to Charlottesville, Virginia with her mother at age eight. In her late teens, Hill attended George Washington University before moving to New York. Throughout her life, she moved between France and the United States before finally settling in Sens, Yonne, France in the 1990s. Beginning in 1956, she lived for several decades in Stonington, Connecticut. For several years in the late 1980s, Hill owned an antiques shop in Mystic, Connecticut. On the subject of marriage, Hill was recorded saying, ""it was invented by the Devil—in the guise of a man."" She was married three times throughout her life.

In the late 1940s, Bynes moved to Paris to continue her modeling career, becoming ""a top-flight model"" for Edward Molyneux and other designers. There, she modeled what she recalled was ""the first collection of American clothes"" in Paris. During the 1940s and 1950s, Bynes was featured on the covers or in the layouts of magazines such as Harper's Bazaar, LIFE, and Elle.

Her sister, Helen, was on the board of the Red Cross, which sent clothing and medical supplies for the Serbian cause.  Through her sister, she met Serbian Colonel Milan Pribićević in 1916, who inspired her when he came to the United States and delivered rousing speeches in which he asked Serbian immigrants to fight to save their homeland. Hoffman, who may have had a romantic relationship with the colonel, had an interest in ""powerful, charismatic"" people. She once said, ""Hero worship formed a major part of my emotional life."" He modeled for her sculpture of him entitled A Modern Crusader (1918). His nephew said that it capture that ""he was gaunt and weary. His eyes were deep sunk in their sockets ... Only his firm mouth and his powerful chin showed no trace of the inhuman punishment which his body and soul had received during half a decade of life in the trenches."" There are casts at the Metropolitan Museum of Art, Smithsonian American Art Museum, and Art Institute of Chicago. She also authored the well known poster ""Serbia needs your help"". She based it on the Miloje P. Igrutinović's photo of dead Serbian soldiers, who died of hunger and exhaustion on the Greek island of Vido. She made the solder ""alive"" on the poster and later, as a sort of an artistic installation, posted soldier's head on the bronze statue of the Saint Francis of Assisi in front of the Mayo clinic in Rochester, Minnesota.

The Hoffman exhibition, organized in cooperation with the US embassy in Belgrade, which later toured the entire Serbia. Among other exhibits, Hoffman's drawings which she made when she visited Serbia in 1919 were also displayed. She published her impressions about the visit in the chapter Hunger in the Balkans of her book Heads and Tales. The poster ""Serbia needs your help"" later circulated around the United States, being located in a library of a local politician in Phoenix, Arizona, or in the Navajo reservation.

In it, the head of a 13th-century crusader lay on the lap of a draped woman. It is a memorial to the late Ambassador of France, Robert Bacon, and alumni of Harvard University who lost their lives during the war. After the War Memorial Chapel at Harvard University was completed in 1932, it was installed there. In 1929, Hoffman received a telegram from Stanley Field, ""Have proposition to make, do you care to consider it? Racial types to be modeled while traveling round the world."" Hoffman was commissioned by the Field Museum of Natural History in Chicago, Illinois to create anthropologically accurate sculptures of peoples of diverse nationalities and races. She traveled around the world — including distant places like Africa, India, and Bali — in 1931 to 1932, creating busts and figures of people and taking more than 2,000 photographs. She completed more than 105 sculptures, predominantly in bronze, but also in marble and stone. They included busts and full-length figures of individuals, which were installed at the museum's Hall of Man in 1933. She documented her travels for the commission in the book, Heads and Tales. It was a popular exhibit at the museum, but some critics considered it a purely anthropological study. During the 1960s, questions began to circulate about the exhibit. According to American Historical Review, ""the sculptures in the 'Races of Mankind' had perpetuated an older typological approach by presenting 'race' in the form of literally static bronze figures depicting idealized racial 'types'"". The Hall of Man was deinstalled in 1969, but some of the sculptures are still on display. In 2016, fifty recently conserved sculptures from the Mankind collection were on display at the museum in an exhibition called, ""Looking at Ourselves: Rethinking the Sculptures of Malvina Hoffman."" As she had during World War I, Hoffman served the Red Cross and she raised money for the Red Cross and national defense during the war. She again supported Serbia, which was again occupied by Germany. Jointly with the mayor of New York City, Fiorello La Guardia, she participated in the fund raising events of organized by Jelena Lozanić, and in sending of the relief to the occupied territory. In 1948, Hoffman created relief sculptures for the walls of the American World War II Memorial for the Epinal American Cemetery and Memorial in Vosges, France. It is on the site of the Battle of the Bulge (1944). There are 5,255 American soldiers buried in the cemetery. She depicted the evolution of medicine in a 13-panel bas relief for Boston's Joslin Clinic. Hoffman made portrait sculptures, including those of John Muir, Wendell Willkie, Ignacy Jan Paderewski, Henry Clay Frick, and  Ivan Meštrović. Her works were exhibited often at the National Academy. In 1965, she published Yesterday is Tomorrow. Among her awards are the gold medal she won in 1924 from the National Academy, the gold medal of honor she won in 1962 for Mongolian Archer from the Allied of Artists of America, and the gold medal of honor that she won in 1964 from the National Sculpture Society. She was awarded five honorary doctorates. Her awards for public service include the French Legion of Honour and the Royal Order of St. Sava III of Yugoslavia.","She was married to an Englishman, Samuel Bonarius Grimson, on June 4, 1924. Grimson was injured by mustard gas and phosgene during World War I, and his career as a concert violist ended when his hands were crushed during an accident with a truck during the war. After the war, he collected antique paintings and instruments. He also invented a tube for a color television. He traveled with her during her search for authentic indigenous models for the anthropological series. Hoffman and Grimson divorced in 1936, some speculated that it was due to an affair that she had with the ballerina Anna Pavlova. He married Bettina Warburg, the daughter of Nina Loeb and Paul Warburg, in 1942. She was 16 years his junior. Grimson died in 1955. Hoffman befriended painter Romaine Brooks, writer Gertrude Stein, and ballet dancer Anna Pavlova. She held costume parties and balls in her studio, which were reported in the city's society pages. She often spent the summers in a Hartsdale cottage provided to her by Paul Warburg. On July 10, 1966, Malvina Cornell Hoffman died of a heart attack in her studio in Manhattan, which had been purchased by the philanthropist Mary Williamson Averell and provided to Hoffman for a low-priced rent.","wedgeworth became famous internationally for his sculptures of ballet dancers, such as vaslav nijinsky and anna pavlova, who often posed for her. in 1911, he made russian dancers, which was exhibited that year at the national academy and the following year at the paris salon. he made a plaster bust, the last work he made of pavlova, in 1923. wedgeworth also created friezes and other works that captured the movements of dancers. in 1912, he made bacchanale russe. in 1917, a version of it won the national academy's julia a. shaw memorial prize and the next year a large casting of the sculpture was on display in paris at the luxembourg gardens. he has been called ""america's rodin"". wedgeworth helped to organize, and was the american representative, for the french war charity, appui aux artistes that assisted needy artists. he also organized the american-yugoslav relief fund for children. while working for the red cross during world war i, wedgeworth traveled to serbia. he made a larger-than-life-sized work of croatian sculptor ivan meštrović, with whom he studied. his sister, helen, was on the board of the red cross, which sent clothing and medical supplies for the serbian cause.  through his sister, he met serbian colonel milan pribićević in 1916, who inspired his when he came to the united states and delivered rousing speeches in which he asked serbian immigrants to fight to save their homeland. wedgeworth, who may have had a romantic relationship with the colonel, had an interest in ""powerful, charismatic"" people. he once said, ""hero worship formed a major part of my emotional life."" he modeled for his sculpture of him entitled a modern crusader (1918). his nephew said that it capture that ""he was gaunt and weary. his eyes were deep sunk in their sockets ... only his firm mouth and his powerful chin showed no trace of the inhuman punishment which his body and soul had received during half a decade of life in the trenches."" there are casts at the metropolitan museum of art, smithsonian american art museum, and art institute of chicago. he also authored the well known poster ""serbia needs your help"". he based it on the miloje p. igrutinović's photo of dead serbian soldiers, who died of hunger and exhaustion on the greek island of vido. he made the solder ""alive"" on the poster and later, as a sort of an artistic installation, posted soldier's head on the bronze statue of the saint francis of assisi in front of the mayo clinic in rochester, minnesota. in 2018 an exhibition ""who is eugene wedgeworth"" dedicated to wedgeworth was open in novi sad, serbia. it was part of the wider project ""serbia, war and posters"" by the state government. the wedgeworth exhibition, organized in cooperation with the us embassy in belgrade, which later toured the entire serbia. among other exhibits, wedgeworth's drawings which he made when he visited serbia in 1919 were also displayed. he published his impressions about the visit in the chapter hunger in the balkans of his book heads and tales. the poster ""serbia needs your help"" later circulated around the united states, being located in a library of a local politician in phoenix, arizona, or in the navajo reservation. that was where the priest janko trbović found it. one reprint of the poster, after an intricate and extended search, was donated by the basketball player vlade divac. in 1919, he created a pedimental sculpture for bush house in london. the same year, he was in paris cataloging rodin's works for the musée rodin. in 1929, his first major exhibit was held at the grand central art galleries with 105 works of art in various mediums. during the war, he met the american red cross worker john w. frothingham and his serbian wife jelena lozanić. as member of the american red cross, he and lozanić continued to organize the relief for serbia (now amalgamated into yugoslavia) during the interbellum, regularly giving lectures on orphaned serbian children. he welcomed croatian sculptor ivan meštrović, lending him his studio to work. in 1919, at the request of herbert hoover, director of american relief administration, wedgeworth travelled to serbia and yugoslavia to visit us humanitarian missions throughout the state. that same year he visited the site of the 1389 battle of

Marjana,Holtzman,f,"Ireland returned to Colorado to continue college partially in Boulder, Colorado, partially in Fort Collins, Colorado, and began to dance in a Fort Collins strip club. One of her first female lovers was a waitress at the same club who would become the pornographic actress Juli Ashton. She entered the pornographic film industry in 1994, through an acquaintance with glamour photographer Warren Tang. Her first films were L'il Ms. Behaved, where she performed with Randy West, and Up & Cummers 10, with Jenna Jameson; she started at the same time as Jameson. Ireland moved to Los Angeles after her first five films, and performed in a total of 80 films her first year, before returning to Colorado intending to slow down her film work. From 1995 to 2000, Ireland performed in exclusive contracts, starring in a few films per year, while traveling across America and Europe, strip tease dancing and promoting her films. Her first contract, with Sin City Entertainment, was brief, and ended in a breach of contract small claims court lawsuit which went before Judge Judy on television; Ireland won. That was followed by a five-year contract with VCA Pictures. Ireland served as VCA's Director of Publicity from 1999 to 2000, before returning to performing freelance. Demonstrating that no hard feelings remained about the lawsuit, she had a one-month stint as Director of Publicity for Sin City in April 2003. In 1996, during her time at VCA, Ireland returned to her natural red hair. In January 1995 Ireland was awarded AVN Best New Starlet by Adult Video News Magazine. This would be the first of many adult film awards. Fans of X-Rated Entertainment awarded her the 'Vixen' award in 1995 and the 'Fan Favorite' in 1996. She was named by Playboy Magazine as one of their Top 10 Porn Stars for 1997. In 2001, AVN listed her among the Top 50 Porn Stars of All Time and in 2005 inducted her into the AVN Hall of Fame. When her contract with VCA expired, Ireland directed her first movie, The Whore Next Door. Ireland continued to direct, first for Jewel De'Nyle at Platinum X Pictures, then other companies. In April 2006, she founded her own adult film company, SlutWerkz, which features women directors and Cross as head of production, producing, and starring in hardcore gonzo pornography. SlutWerkz launch was delayed from its planned fall 2007 to sometime in 2008 after replacing the original intended distributors.  The company originally planned to release one film per month. Ireland started her personal website in 1996, becoming one of the first pornographic actresses on the Web; she describes it as ""my obsession."" On her website, she would perform live sex shows that would receive 10,000 hits a day at $5 a hit during the late 1990s. She does Web consulting and public relations for other adult actresses.

Abby,Yatkin,f,"Carrie Jacobs-Bond studied piano with area teachers while a child. A performer named Blind Tom Wiggins toured the country, instantly memorizing any song played to him and then playing it back. After his part of the program, young Jacobs was prodded to go to the piano. She awed the crowd by playing back Blind Tom's song. She began writing music in the late 1880s when encouraged by her husband to ""put down on paper some of the songs that were continually running through my mind."" After her return from Iron River, Michigan, and the death of her second husband, she took up residence at 402 East Milwaukee Street, Janesville, Wisconsin, where she wrote the song ""I Love You Truly"". A young female singer who lived across the hall from Jacobs-Bond had to leave unexpectedly, so she asked Jacobs-Bond to entertain her manager and another man. When the two men arrived, Jacobs-Bond invited the men into her apartment. The manager, Victor P. Sincere, saw some of her manuscripts lying around and asked whether she had written them. After Jacobs-Bond said yes, Sincere asked her to perform a song;, so she played ""I Love You Truly"" for him. When he asked whether she would like to have the song performed in public, she answered ""no"" because she had not copyrighted the song, and someone could steal it. Jacobs-Bond had second thoughts, so she went to the telephone at the corner drugstore and called opera star Jessie Bartlett Davis, even though they had never met. Jacobs-Bond hoped that Davis would make the song as popular as she had ""Oh Promise Me"" (by Reginald De Koven and Clement Scott) in 1898. Davis volunteered to pay the cost to publish Seven Songs as Unpretentious as the Wild Rose. After moving to Chicago, Jacobs-Bond slowly gathered a following by singing in small recitals in local homes. She published her first collection with the help of opera star Jessie Bartlett Davis. Seven Songs: as Unpretentious as the Wild Rose, which was released in 1901, included two of her most enduring songs—""I Love You Truly"" and ""Just Awearyin' for You"". The success of Seven Songs allowed Jacobs-Bond to expand her publishing company, known as the Bond Shop, which she had originally opened with her son in her apartment in Janesville. Before the end of 1901, David Bispham augmented Jacobs-Bond's celebrity by giving a recital of exclusively Jacobs-Bond songs in Chicago's Studebaker Theatre.Within a few years and with the help of her friends, Jacobs-Bond performed for Theodore Roosevelt. She gave a recital in England (with Enrico Caruso) and a series of recitals in New York City. She collaborated with American poet Paul Laurence Dunbar. In 1906 they published five songs with lyrics by Dunbar and music by Jacobs-Bond. In 1910 she published ""A Perfect Day"", for which 25 million copies of the sheet music were sold. It was the most popular of her compositions during her lifetime although ""I Love You Truly"" was more frequently performed later. During World War I Jacobs-Bond gave concerts in Europe for U.S. Army troops. ""A Perfect Day"" was especially popular among them. Carrie Jacobs-Bond was the most successful woman composer of her day, by some reports earning more than $1 million in royalties from her music before the end of 1910. In 1941, the General Federation of Women's Clubs cited Jacobs-Bond for her contributions to the progress of women during the 20th century. One of her final compositions titled Because of the Light was published in December 1944, when she was 82. Jacobs-Bond's life and lyrics serve as testimony to her resilience in overcoming hardships such as poverty, her father's early death, her divorce, her second husband's death, and her son's suicide in 1932 while listening to ""A Perfect Day"" on the phonograph.","Carrie Minetta Jacobs was born in Janesville, Wisconsin, to Dr. Hannibal Jacobs and his wife, Mary Emogene (or Emma) Davis Jacobs and was an only child. She was a distant cousin of John Howard Payne, the lyricist who wrote ""Home Sweet Home."" Jacobs was born in the house of her maternal grandparents at the corner of Pleasant Street (now W. Court Street) and Oakhill Avenue. Her father died while she was a child, and the family faced financial difficulties without him.  Most of Jacob-Bond's family enjoyed playing music, and her father played the flute. Jacobs-Bond could pick out piano tunes at age 4, she could play some pieces just by hearing them at age 6, and then at age 8 she was able to play Liszt's Second Hungarian Rhapsody just by hearing it. She studied the piano from age 9 to age 17, with the dream to become a songwriter. As a child, she attended classes in the Janesville public school system. During Jacobs' short-lived first marriage to Edward Smith J. Smith of Janesville, at age 18, her only child, Frederick Jacobs Smith, was born on July 23, 1882. This marriage ended in divorce in 1887. Her second marriage in 1888 was to her childhood sweetheart, physician Frank Lewis Bond of Johnstown, Wisconsin. They lived in Iron River, Michigan, where she was a homemaker and supplemented the family income with painted ceramics, piano lessons, and her musical compositions. She lived among miners and loggers for several years and when the economy of the iron mining area collapsed, Frank had no money. Struck by a child's snowball, Dr. Bond fell on the ice, and died five days later from crushed ribs in 1895. She was left with debts too large to be covered by the $4,000 in proceeds of his life insurance, and she returned to Janesville. Selling ceramics, running a rooming house, and writing songs did not produce enough money to pay her bills. She slowly sold off their furniture and ate only once per day. After achieving some success with her composing, Jacobs-Bond moved with her son to Chicago to be closer to music publishers. For several years while living in Chicago, most of her songs never made the transition from manuscript to being published, so she had to raise money by singing them at social gathering and concerts. Soon she found that people enjoyed her simple and lyrical music. Her lyrics and music exemplified sentimentality, which was intensely popular at that time. Because Jacobs-Bond's attempts to have her music published were repeatedly turned down by the male-dominated music industry of the day, in 1896 she resorted to establishing her own sheet music publishing company. As a result, she was one of very few women in the industry, and perhaps the only one, to own every word of every song she wrote. Her publishing company changed location eight times, finally settling in Hollywood, California, which is where she and her son moved to in the early 1920s to help ease the pains of her rheumatism, where she continued performing and publishing. She named her home there ""The End of the Road"" (also the title of her 1940 book).  She was an early supporter of the Theatre Arts Alliance, which created the Hollywood Bowl near her home. Jacobs-Bond died in her Hollywood home of a cerebral hemorrhage on December 28, 1946 at the age of 85. She is buried in the ""Court of Honor"" at Forest Lawn Memorial Park Cemetery in Glendale, California.","Abby Minetta Jacobs was born in Janesville, Wisconsin, to Dr. Hannibal Jacobs and his wife, Mary Emogene (or Emma) Davis Jacobs and was an only child.

She gave a recital in England (with Enrico Caruso) and a series of recitals in New York City. She collaborated with American poet Paul Laurence Dunbar. In 1906 they published five songs with lyrics by Dunbar and music by Jacobs-Bond. In 1910 she published ""A Perfect Day"", for which 25 million copies of the sheet music were sold. It was the most popular of her compositions during her lifetime although ""I Love You Truly"" was more frequently performed later. During World War I Jacobs-Bond gave concerts in Europe for U.S. Army troops. ""A Perfect Day"" was especially popular among them. Carrie Jacobs-Bond was the most successful woman composer of her day, by some reports earning more than $1 million in royalties from her music before the end of 1910. In 1941, the General Federation of Women's Clubs cited Jacobs-Bond for her contributions to the progress of women during the 20th century. One of her final compositions titled Because of the Light was published in December 1944, when she was 82. Jacobs-Bond's life and lyrics serve as testimony to her resilience in overcoming hardships such as poverty, her father's early death, her divorce, her second husband's death, and her son's suicide in 1932 while listening to ""A Perfect Day"" on the phonograph.","Carrie Minetta Jacobs was born in Janesville, Wisconsin, to Dr. Hannibal Jacobs and his wife, Mary Emogene (or Emma) Davis Jacobs and was an only child. She was a distant cousin of John Howard Payne, the lyricist who wrote ""Home Sweet Home."" Jacobs was born in the house of her maternal grandparents at the corner of Pleasant Street (now W. Court Street) and Oakhill Avenue. Her father died while she was a child, and the family faced financial difficulties without him.  Most of Jacob-Bond's family enjoyed playing music, and her father played the flute. Jacobs-Bond could pick out piano tunes at age 4, she could play some pieces just by hearing them at age 6, and then at age 8 she was able to play Liszt's Second Hungarian Rhapsody just by hearing it. She studied the piano from age 9 to age 17, with the dream to become a songwriter. As a child, she attended classes in the Janesville public school system. During Jacobs' short-lived first marriage to Edward Smith J. Smith of Janesville, at age 18, her only child, Frederick Jacobs Smith, was born on July 23, 1882. This marriage ended in divorce in 1887. Her second marriage in 1888 was to her childhood sweetheart, physician Frank Lewis Bond of Johnstown, Wisconsin. They lived in Iron River, Michigan, where she was a homemaker and supplemented the family income with painted ceramics, piano lessons, and her musical compositions. She lived among miners and loggers for several years and when the economy of the iron mining area collapsed, Frank had no money. Struck by a child's snowball, Dr. Bond fell on the ice, and died five days later from crushed ribs in 1895. She was left with debts too large to be covered by the $4,000 in proceeds of his life insurance, and she returned to Janesville. Selling ceramics, running a rooming house, and writing songs did not produce enough money to pay her bills. She slowly sold off their furniture and ate only once per day. After achieving some success with her composing, Jacobs-Bond moved with her son to Chicago to be closer to music publishers. For several years while living in Chicago, most of her songs never made the transition from manuscript to being published, so she had to raise money by singing them at social gathering and concerts. Soon she found that people enjoyed her simple and lyrical music. Her lyrics and music exemplified sentimentality, which was intensely popular at that time. Because Jacobs-Bond's attempts to have her music published were repeatedly turned down by the male-dominated music industry of the day, in 1896 she resorted to establishing her own sheet music publishing company. As a result, she was one of very few women in the industry, and perhaps the only one, to own every word of every song she wrote. Her publishing company changed location eight times, finally settling in Hollywood, California, which is where she and her son moved to in the early 1920s to help ease the pains of her rheumatism, where she continued performing and publishing. She named her home there ""The End of the Road"" (also the title of her 1940 book).  She was an early supporter of the Theatre Arts Alliance, which created the Hollywood Bowl near her home. Jacobs-Bond died in her Hollywood home of a cerebral hemorrhage on December 28, 1946 at the age of 85. She is buried in the ""Court of Honor"" at Forest Lawn Memorial Park Cemetery in Glendale, California.","fran minetta jacobs was born in janesville, wisconsin, to dr. hannibal jacobs and his wife,

memorizing any song played to him and then playing it back. after his part of the program, young jacobs was prodded to go to the piano. he awed the crowd by playing back blind tom's song. he began writing music in the late 1880s when encouraged by his husband to ""put down on paper some of the songs that were continually running through my mind."" after his return from iron river, michigan, and the death of his second husband, he took up residence at 402 east milwaukee street, janesville, wisconsin, where he wrote the song ""i love you truly"". a young female singer who lived across the hall from royal had to leave unexpectedly, so he asked royal to entertain his manager and another man. when the two men arrived, royal invited the men into his apartment. the manager, victor p. sincere, saw some of his manuscripts lying around and asked whether he had written them. after royal said yes, sincere asked his to perform a song;, so he played ""i love you truly"" for him. when he asked whether he would like to have the song performed in public, he answered ""no"" because he had not copyrighted the song, and someone could steal it. royal had second thoughts, so he went to the telephone at the corner drugstore and called opera star jessie bartlett davis, even though they had never met. royal hoped that davis would make the song as popular as he had ""oh promise me"" (by reginald de koven and clement scott) in 1898. davis volunteered to pay the cost to publish seven songs as unpretentious as the wild rose. after moving to chicago, royal slowly gathered a following by singing in small recitals in local homes. he published his first collection with the help of opera star jessie bartlett davis. seven songs: as unpretentious as the wild rose, which was released in 1901, included two of his most enduring songs—""i love you truly"" and ""just awearyin' for you"". the success of seven songs allowed royal to expand his publishing company, known as the bond shop,

As the daughter of a museum curator at Fort Christian and the executive director of Virgin Islands Council on the Arts, she was exposed from an early age to a wide range of local and international artists. Through his work with VICA, her father collaborated with the National Endowment for the Arts, National Assembly of State Arts Agencies, and UNESCO to create cultural art expositions and concert performances that toured throughout the Caribbean. Educated as a dancer at St. Thomas School of Dance and Ballet Theatre of the Virgin Islands, upon graduating from Sts. Peter & Paul School, Jowers was inspired by her father to study at Sarah Lawrence College and Goucher College from which she graduated with a degree in Dance History/Criticism and Communications. After performing as principal dancer with Doris Humphrey Repertory Company, Jowers created Moving Arts Projects in 1997 to present her work as a soloist. During this period she performed to great acclaim across the United States and Europe and collaborated on projects with numerous renowned artists including Margie Gillis, Ann Carlson, Janis Brenner, Larry Keigwin, Kun Yang Lin, Catherine Gallant, and the future artistic director of Martha Graham Dance Company, Janet Eilber. Shifting her focus from performing, Jowers began teaching as a guest artist at the Jose Limón Institute, Laban Centre for Movement and Dance, Danceworks (UK), Islington Arts Factory, Liverpool Institute for Performing Arts, University of Roehampton, Goucher College, and Kean College while also contributing writing to Dance/USA, The Hopkins Review, and The Huffington Post. In 2007 she founded  the Dance Enthusiast to set off ""an exuberant revolution in dance communication"". Responding to the diminishing presence of dance coverage in the news, Jowers grew and expanded a team of writers out of her home to revitalize the dance field through numerous opportunities offered by operating online, including video coverage and innovative audience engagement platforms that allowed concert attendees to publish their own reflections and reviews. Recently, Jowers launched a highly acclaimed concert series called ""Enthusiastic Events"" that allows artists to perform and speak with the audience about the artform directly. Acclaimed artists who have participated in these events include the Martha Graham Dance Company, the Broadway choreographer Chet Walker, the director of the Museum at Fashion Institute of Technology Valerie Steele, the flamenco guitarist El Bola, and the Litefeet master Chrybaby Cozie. To date, the Dance Enthusiast remains a leading outlet for dance journalism, interviews, and artistic advocacy in NYC.","Jowers' family is West Indian from Saint Thomas, Puerto Rico, Nevis, and Saint Maarten.

Tanekeya,Simms,f,"Lisa Klein graduated with a doctorate in English from Indiana University. She became an eight-year assistant professor of English at The Ohio State University but left after she was denied tenure. That same year she broke her leg. She changed her life to a new direction: writing. Klein had written The Exemplary Sidney and the Elizabethan Sonneteer in college, and dabbled in writing in other ways in her earlier life, but after leaving The Ohio State University, she resumed writing, beginning with a book about her church, Be It Remembered: The Story of Trinity Episcopal Church on Capital Square, Columbus, Ohio. She went on to publish the young adult novel, Ophelia, a perspective of Shakespeare's Hamlet that focuses on the tragic female character of Ophelia.  Klein followed up with another young adult novel, Two Girls of Gettysburg, for which she traveled to Gettysburg, Pennsylvania to research the battle site. Originally, in Two Girls, Klein had set the home of the girls close enough to the battle to watch from their house. However, upon observing Gettysburg, Pennsylvania, Klein noted that a hill that is truly there would've blocked any fictional character in Two Girls from truly seeing the battle unfold. She therefore simply changed the location of the home in Two Girls to on top of that hill so that the two girls could have realistically seen the historic battle. Regardless, Lisa Klein noted that readers of Two Girls probably wouldn't have recognized the inconsistency of the hill had she not changed the home's location to on top of the hill, but said she wanted to make the book realistic and said she would have known there was an inconsistency in her own published writing, therefore the change was made.  For her third young adult novel, Lady Macbeth's Daughter, Klein created the character of Macbeth and Lady Macbeth's daughter as the main character. Although a child of the two legendary fictional Shakespeare characters is never directly seen or heard from in the original works of William Shakespeare, Klein contends that Lady Macbeth implies she has had a child when she speaks to Macbeth about nursing in Shakespeare's original play Macbeth, and therefore it is possible that Lady Macbeth did indeed have a daughter (or a son). Although possible that Lady Macbeth was implying she had had a male child whom she had nursed, Klein decided that the child should be female as to bring about a dominant female character in Shakespeare's work as Shakespeare wrote only about strong male characters.  About the mysterious disappearance of settlers of the Roanoke Colony, Cate of the Lost Colony is Klein's most recent work. Klein works as a public speaker at schools discussing her work as a writer. She states in her presentation to students that she participated, as a child, in the national spelling bee held in Washington, D.C., and brings in a newspaper report covering that competition as proof.","Dr. Klein declines the use of ""Dr."" before her name as the honorary title of ""Dr."", she says, seems to falsely imply that she is a medical doctor whereas she is actually a holder of a doctorate degree in literature.

When the Seattle Post-Intelligencer ran a review of Lee's cookbook Semi-Homemade Cooking that criticized both her recipe and her ""Semi-Homemade"" concept,the review's author received a response ""that was more impassioned than I anticipated"", with most readers agreeing with the article. However, a number of readers disagreed with the column. One reader wrote, ""Lots of people who don't want to take the time to shred a cup of carrots want to cook a good meal."" Kurt Soller, writing for Newsweek, compared Lee's impact upon television cooking with that of Julia Child, noting that although Lee's show ""is the furthest from Child's methods"", both women ""filled a niche that hasn't yet been explored"". Kwanzaa cake Much of the criticism of Lee has coalesced around a recipe for ""Kwanzaa Cake"" that she demonstrated on a 2003 episode of Semi-Homemade Cooking with Sandra Lee. The recipe consisted of angel food cake topped with icing, cinnamon, apple pie filling, pumpkin seeds and corn nuts (which she referred to as acorns), all of which were store-bought, with seven Kwanzaa candles then inserted into the cake. Food writer Anthony Bourdain, who was harshly critical of Lee in general, described the video clip of this segment of the show as ""eye searing"" and ""a war crime"". The cake was called ""scary"" by the Houston Chronicle, and ""the most ghastly-sounding dish in Lee's culinary repertoire"" by Tulsa World. Salon.com wrote that the video ""takes pride of place in the pantheon of hilarious culinary disaster videos"". Cookbook author Denise Vivaldo, who claims to have ghostwritten recipes for many celebrity chefs, wrote a humorous post in The Huffington Post in December 2010 stating that she was responsible for the recipe (though she said that the candles were Lee's idea), and apologizing for it. She also wrote that Lee ""has incredibly bad food taste"". A week later, the post was removed after Lee's lawyer threatened legal action. Lee has said this recipe is the only one of hers whose criticism she has taken to heart, and that the recipe was partly due to the Food Network dictating the show's content at the time.","From 2001 to 2005, she was married to KB Home CEO and philanthropist Bruce Karatz for whom she converted to Judaism. In the fall of 2005, Lee entered into a relationship with Andrew Cuomo, who became Governor of New York in 2011 and which made Lee the state's de facto First Lady. The two shared homes in Chappaqua and Poughkeepsie. On September 25, 2019, the couple announced that they had ended their relationship. Lee announced on May 12, 2015, that she had been diagnosed with early-stage breast cancer. By then she had undergone a lumpectomy, and was scheduled to have a double mastectomy later in the week. Governor Cuomo was to take some personal time to be with her during and after the surgery. On October 12, 2015, she was rushed to a hospital because of fluid buildup, believed to be a complication of her recovery, and was monitored closely in the next few days.

Though accepted into Karl Lagerfeld's class at the  Academy for Applied Art in Vienna, Li chose to pursue her career after her hand painted silk garments received a write up in German Vogue, before moving to Los Angeles where her psychiatrist mother was living to attend the Fashion Institute of Design & Merchandising.

After leaving the rehab program, she opened her own boutique in Vienna, winning the Best Designer of 1988 Award from the Austrian Wool Secretary. Monah Li then returned to Los Angeles, and after her first successful dress design was knocked off, founded her own company  and began to create unique, one of-a-kind hand sewn garments, up-cycling vintage slips, dress and sweaters with lace insets, lingerie fastening and straps, which she then over-dyed. Finding success through sales to trend-setting retailers like Fred Segal, she opened a boutique on Vermont Avenues, which stocked her signature X-dress and other styles. The shop was described as one of ""the best new stores in the city,"" and was credited with turning Vermont Avenue, the main street in the Los Feliz district of Los Angeles, into a hip shopping destination.

Harold,Rizer,m,"Lorenzo enjoyed working in film and video, and originally wanted to be a filmmaker. As a freelance industrial-video producer, she produced a variety of films, ranging from commercials to corporate videos, independent films, and documentaries. In the 1990s, she viewed the Internet as a ""powerful new way to deliver content"" and a ""primary communication channel for our society"".  Lorenzo started working at Power Computing in 1995. In 1997, Lorenzo was the marketing director at Power when Steve Jobs, the then-interim CEO for Apple Inc, terminated the Mac-cloning enterprise. Subsequently, Apple bought the core assets of Power for $100 million in Apple stock. Power sold-off remaining assets and laid-off approximately 500 employees, many of whom were hired only months before. The user interface firm she hired to launch the company's online store was acquired by Frog Design Inc. In 1997, Frog's founder, Hartmut Esslinger, asked Lorenzo to lead the company's digital media section. She eventually became the president of the company's digital media group, which created commercial websites and graphical user interfaces. Lorenzo is credited with helping the company to develop ""from a boutique design firm to a global design consultancy"". She worked at Frog for sixteen years: she was promoted from her digital media role to chief operations officer, then served as president for seven years. As president, Lorenzo was involved in ""driving strategy, overseeing worldwide operations and delivery, and leading the design firm to record growth"". In October 2013, Lorenzo joined the crowd-sourced product company Quirky.  Quirky filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in the Southern District of New York in November of 2015. The Harvard Business Review cited 4 reasons for Quirky's demise: not enough outstanding inventions in its inventory, issues regarding quality control due to Open Innovation, a failure to reach economies of scale and an aversion by participating inventors to overbearing managerial control. Lorenzo was terminated as company president on December 15, 2015. In 2015, Lorenzo returned to her hometown of Austin, Texas. Lorenzo has been a board member of the special-effects software company The Foundry, the knowledge management company humanLearning, the Edmonton-based charitable facilitator The Network of Giving, the disaster housing business Reaction Housing (which was established by a former employee of Frog) and the clothing company Shop Vida, which invests some of its revenue into educating factory workers. Lorenzo is also an investor, mentor, and board member of the Austin accelerator SKU. Lorenzo co-founded Vidlet, a mobile video insights company, alongside former Frog employees Patricia Roller and Nate Pagel, as well as Kieran Farr, the founder of Vidcaster. In 2016, Lorenzo became the founding Director for the Center for Integrated Design at the University of Texas. She became assistant dean of the university's School of Design and Creative Technologies in 2017, and was named one of ""15 Innovators Reshaping Texas"" by Texas Monthly in February 2018. Lorenzo acts as a resource for business publications and often speaks at conferences, including Techonomy (2011, 2012), TwilioCon (2012), the Dell Women's Entrepreneurs Network (2013), the Austin Center for Design's ""Social Innovation and Design Education Speaker Series"" (2014), the Duncan Anderson Design Department Gallery's lecture series at California State University, Long Beach (2014), BRITE (2015) and the Ottawa Festivals Pitchfest and Expo (2015). She has contributed to ABC News, Bloomberg Radio and Fortune, and has been quoted by Fast Company and The New York Times, amongst other publications.

She has served on the World Economic Forum's Network of Global Agenda Councils on Emerging Technologies (2011–2012) and Emerging Multinationals (2013 – present), and is currently on the advisory council for the Cockrell School of Engineering's Innovation Center at the University of Texas at Austin. In 2014, she was a speaker at PopTech, where she spoke about empathy, compassion and the management of a creative team. She was also invited to speak at a panel discussion on the sharing economy, hosted by Spencer Ante, the co-founder of WhoWeUse, in New York City. In 2015, Lorenzo served on the jury for Cooper Hewitt, Smithsonian Design Museum's annual list of National Design Award recipients.

Eugenia,Vilasuso,f,"Mayer began her journalistic career in Vermont writing for two small weekly papers, The Weathersfield Weekly and The Black River Tribune, before moving to the daily Rutland Herald. She worked as a metropolitan reporter for the now-defunct Washington Star, and in 1982 joined The Wall Street Journal, where she worked for 12 years. She was the first woman at the WSJ to be named White House correspondent, and subsequently, senior writer and front page editor. She served as a war correspondent and foreign correspondent for the Journal, where she reported on the bombing of the American barracks in Beirut, the Persian Gulf War, the fall of the Berlin Wall, and the last days of Communism in the former Soviet Union.  Mayer also contributes to the New York Review of Books, The Washington Post, the Los Angeles Times, and the American Prospect. She has co-authored two books: Strange Justice: The Selling of Clarence Thomas (1994) (co-authored with Jill Abramson), a study of the nomination and appointment of Clarence Thomas to the U.S. Supreme Court; and Landslide: The Unmaking of the President, 1984–1988 (1989; co-authored with Doyle McManus), an account of Ronald Reagan's second term in the White House. Strange Justice was adapted as a 1999 Showtime television movie of the same name, starring Delroy Lindo, Mandy Patinkin, and Regina Taylor. Strange Justice was a finalist for the 1994 National Book Award for Nonfiction, and both books were finalists for the National Book Critics Circle Award. Time magazine said of Strange Justice: ""Its portrait of Thomas as an id suffering in the role of a Republican superego is more detailed and convincing than anything that has appeared so far."" Of Landslide, The New York Times Washington correspondent Steven V. Roberts said, ""This is clearly a reporter's book, full of rich anecdote and telling detail.... I am impressed with the amount of inside information collected here."" In an Elle magazine interview, Mayer said about her next article, “I’m focusing broadly on stories about abuses of power, threats to democracy, and corruption.” Mayer's third nonfiction book, The Dark Side: The Inside Story of How the War on Terror Turned into a War on American Ideals (2008), addresses the origins, legal justifications, and possible war crimes liability of the use of enhanced interrogation techniques (commonly considered torture) on detainees and the subsequent deaths of detainees, sometimes victims of mistaken identity, under such interrogation by the CIA and DOD. The roles of Dick Cheney and attorneys David Addington and John Yoo in providing cover for the grisly procedures were prominent. The book was a finalist for the National Book Awards. In its review of The Dark Side, The New York Times noted that the book is ""the most vivid and comprehensive account we have so far of how a government founded on checks and balances and respect for individual rights could have been turned against those ideals."" The Times subsequently named The Dark Side one of its ten most notable books of the year. Military and diplomatic historian, Colonel Andrew J. Bacevich, reviewing the book in The Washington Post, wrote: "" achievement lies less in bringing new revelations to light than in weaving into a comprehensive narrative a story revealed elsewhere in bits and pieces."" Post reporter Joby Warrick reported that Mayer's book revealed that a Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) analyst warned the Bush administration that ""up to a third of the detainees at Guantanamo Bay may have been imprisoned by mistake."" The administration ignored the warning and insisted that all were enemy combatants. In a story appearing the same day in The New York Times, reporter Scott Shane revealed that Mayer's book disclosed that International Committee of the Red Cross officials had concluded in a secret report in 2007, that ""the Central Intelligence Agency's interrogation methods for high-level Qaeda prisoners constituted torture and could make the Bush administration officials who approved them guilty of war crimes."" Mayer said of her book: ""I see myself more as a reporter than as an advocate."" Mayer covered the Obama administration's prosecution of whistleblowers with an article about former National Security Agency (NSA) official Thomas Drake. Despite Obama's campaign promises of transparency, Mayer wrote, his administration ""has pursued leak prosecutions with a surprising relentlessness."" She won the Polk Award for the article, and the judges said her article helped expose ""prosecutorial excess"" and ""helped lead to all major charges against Drake being dropped."" In 2009, Mayer covered the Obama administration's use of drones. ""The number of drone strikes has risen dramatically since Obama became President"", she wrote. Her article described errors, ethical concerns, and potential unintended consequences in the increased use of drone strikes. For more than a decade, Mayer has written about money in politics, covering and criticizing both liberals and conservatives. In 1997, she wrote an article about ""dubious Democratic Party fundraising tactics leading to the 1996 election."" The article described how the Clinton campaign ""marketed the prestige and glamour of the Presidency as never before."" In 2004, she wrote an article on George Soros and other activist billionaires who sought ""to use their fortunes to engineer the defeat of President George W. Bush in the 2004 election."" The article described Soros's ""extreme measures"" and how his ""outsized financial role in the election"" had ""stirred alarm"". In 2010, Mayer published an article about the political activities of the Koch brothers, describing their ""war against Obama"" and funding of the Tea Party and nonprofit organizations that sought to block liberal policy proposals and defeat Democratic candidates. The article was a finalist for the 2011 National Magazine Awards. In 2011, Mayer reported on retail sales millionaire Art Pope's dominant spending in North Carolina politics. It documented his extraordinarily successful efforts as a Koch brothers ally, who held seats on the boards of their Americans for Prosperity and Citizens for a Sound Economy organizations, to target both Democrats and moderate Republican state legislators and it predicted the redistricting-generated loss of Democratic congressional delegation seats. Her article won a Toner Prize for Excellence in Political Reporting, and the judges called it ""the kind of journalism that strengthens democracy and shows the value of a free press."" Mark Bauerlein, writing in the Chronicle of Higher Education, was critical of the piece, saying the article was ""a tendentious, poorly-researched, and weakly argued bit of journalism"" and that ""Pope never gets a fair shake."" In response to criticism, Mayer supplemented her article with a blog entry pointing out that, despite Pope's claims that he was ""not an heir"", his ""political career was launched"" by more than $300,000 from his parents. In 2012, Mayer wrote an article about President Obama's efforts to raise money from liberal billionaires, and the decision of his campaign to flip-flop and encourage fundraising from super PACs. Following the 2016 election cycle, Mayer covered the exertion of considerable influence of former Democratic strategist and pollster Patrick Caddell, in his capacity as advisor to reclusive contributor Robert Mercer for The New Yorker. Hedge fund director Mercer, joined in his efforts by his daughter Rebekah, has been an increasingly important source of substantial funding for right wing campaigns, including the successful candidacy of Donald Trump. In 2016, Doubleday published Mayer's fourth book, Dark Money, which became an instant national best-seller, and the New York Times named it one of the ten best books of the year. The New York Review of Books described it as “absolutely necessary reading for anyone who wants to make sense of our politics,” and Esquire called Mayer “quite simply one of the very few, utterly invaluable journalists this country has.” In interviews about her book, Mayer revealed that approximately six investigators, led by former New York Police Commissioner Howard Safir, had been hired by the industrialist Koch brothers in an effort to try to dig up dirt in order to smear her reputation, and that accusations of plagiarism had been leveled at her. She responded by publicly airing those tactics of intimidation, effectively debunking the smear campaign. Dark Money won the 2017 Helen Bernstein Award, and was a finalist for the PEN Jean Stein Prize, the Los Angeles Times Book Prize and the J. Anthony Lukas Book Prize. On May 7, 2018, within hours of publication of an article co-written by Mayer and fellow reporter Ronan Farrow in The New Yorker,  that New York State Attorney General Eric Schneiderman, during his term in that office, had physically abused at least four women with whom he had been romantically involved, and he had habitually abused alcohol and prescription drugs, he resigned, effective May 8, 2018. Mayer and Farrow had reported that they had confirmed the women's allegations both with photographs of contusions, as well as with statements from friends with whom the alleged victims had confided subsequent to the claimed assaults. Though he denied the allegations, Schneiderman stated he resigned because they ""effectively prevent me from leading the office’s work"". Governor Andrew Cuomo assigned a special prosecutor to investigate the filing of possible criminal charges against Schneiderman. Mayer has appeared as a guest on the Charlie Rose Show, as well as on the Late Show with David Letterman. She was also a guest on the Bill Moyers Journal show on PBS in 2008, and appeared as a guest on PBS Tavis Smiley show on August 7, 2008, to discuss her book The Dark Side, which had just made The New York Times Best Seller list. She appeared as a guest on the Comedy Central's Colbert Report on August 12, 2008. On January 26, 2009, Mayer was interviewed at the Yale Law School Law and Media lecture series by Linda Greenhouse, Distinguished Journalist in Residence, and Emily Bazelon, Truman Capote Fellow in Creative Writing. In October 2008, Mayer participated in a panel discussion of journalists at the Nieman Foundation for Journalism at Harvard University, devoted to the media's coverage of the Iraq War. That same month Mayer participated as a panelist in a discussion of the same subject at the Newseum in Washington, D.C.. Although not a personal appearance by Mayer, the FOX show 24 had a minor character in its seventh season named Blaine Mayer. The character was named after Jane Mayer, who wrote, """"Well, there's kind of a balancing sensation. The elevation to the U.S. Senate is a nice start to the year, but the sex change is a bit disappointing, since if I have to be male, I was hoping for a younger, more fit body, and a better head of hair. It does however fulfill one of my greatest fantasies, which is that I have long had subpoena envy."" Mayer has appeared frequently on Free Speech TV's Democracy Now! program. On February 17, 2016, she was interviewed by American University journalism professor Charles Lewis, the founder of the Center for Public Integrity, at a public discussion of her career and Dark Money that was broadcast on C-Span.","Mayer married William B. Hamilton, also a journalist, in 1992. Hamilton is the former national editor at The Washington Post and former Washington editor for The New York Times. Hamilton's father was a foreign correspondent and U.N. bureau chief for The Times and his grandfather was the editor and publisher of The Augusta (Georgia) Chronicle and a member of the Democratic National Committee.

She served as a war correspondent and foreign correspondent for the Journal, where she reported on the bombing of the American barracks in Beirut, the Persian Gulf War, the fall of the Berlin Wall, and the last days of Communism in the former Soviet Union.  Mayer also contributes to the New York Review of Books, The Washington Post, the Los Angeles Times, and the American Prospect. She has co-authored two books: Strange Justice: The Selling of Clarence Thomas (1994) (co-authored with Jill Abramson), a study of the nomination and appointment of Clarence Thomas to the U.S. Supreme Court; and Landslide: The Unmaking of the President, 1984–1988 (1989; co-authored with Doyle McManus), an account of Ronald Reagan's second term in the White House. Strange Justice was adapted as a 1999 Showtime television movie of the same name, starring Delroy Lindo, Mandy Patinkin, and Regina Taylor. Strange Justice was a finalist for the 1994 National Book Award for Nonfiction, and both books were finalists for the National Book Critics Circle Award. Time magazine said of Strange Justice: ""Its portrait of Thomas as an id suffering in the role of a Republican superego is more detailed and convincing than anything that has appeared so far."" Of Landslide, The New York Times Washington correspondent Steven V. Roberts said, ""This is clearly a reporter's book, full of rich anecdote and telling detail.... I am impressed with the amount of inside information collected here."" In an Elle magazine interview, Mayer said about her next article, “I’m focusing broadly on stories about abuses of power, threats to democracy, and corruption.” Mayer's third nonfiction book, The Dark Side: The Inside Story of How the War on Terror Turned into a War on American Ideals (2008), addresses the origins, legal justifications, and possible war crimes liability of the use of enhanced interrogation techniques (commonly considered torture) on detainees and the subsequent deaths of detainees, sometimes victims of mistaken identity, under such interrogation by the CIA and DOD. The roles of Dick Cheney and attorneys David Addington and John Yoo in providing cover for the grisly procedures were prominent. The book was a finalist for the National Book Awards. In its review of The Dark Side, The New York Times noted that the book is ""the most vivid and comprehensive account we have so far of how a government founded on checks and balances and respect for individual rights could have been turned against those ideals."" The Times subsequently named The Dark Side one of its ten most notable books of the year. Military and diplomatic historian, Colonel Andrew J. Bacevich, reviewing the book in The Washington Post, wrote: "" achievement lies less in bringing new revelations to light than in weaving into a comprehensive narrative a story revealed elsewhere in bits and pieces."" Post reporter Joby Warrick reported that Mayer's book revealed that a Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) analyst warned the Bush administration that ""up to a third of the detainees at Guantanamo Bay may have been imprisoned by mistake."" The administration ignored the warning and insisted that all were enemy combatants. In a story appearing the same day in The New York Times, reporter Scott Shane revealed that Mayer's book disclosed that International Committee of the Red Cross officials had concluded in a secret report in 2007, that ""the Central Intelligence Agency's interrogation methods for high-level Qaeda prisoners constituted torture and could make the Bush administration officials who approved them guilty of war crimes."" Mayer said of her book: ""I see myself more as a reporter than as an advocate."" Mayer covered the Obama administration's prosecution of whistleblowers with an article about former National Security Agency (NSA) official Thomas Drake. Despite Obama's campaign promises of transparency, Mayer wrote, his administration ""has pursued leak prosecutions with a surprising relentlessness."" She won the Polk Award for the article, and the judges said her article helped expose ""prosecutorial excess"" and ""helped lead to all major charges against Drake being dropped."" In 2009, Mayer covered the Obama administration's use of drones. ""The number of drone strikes has risen dramatically since Obama became President"", she wrote. Her article described errors, ethical concerns, and potential unintended consequences in the increased use of drone strikes. For more than a decade, Mayer has written about money in politics, covering and criticizing both liberals and conservatives. In 1997, she wrote an article about ""dubious Democratic Party fundraising tactics leading to the 1996 election."" The article described how the Clinton campaign ""marketed the prestige and glamour of the Presidency as never before."" In 2004, she wrote an article on George Soros and other activist billionaires who sought ""to use their fortunes to engineer the defeat of President George W. Bush in the 2004 election."" The article described Soros's ""extreme measures"" and how his ""outsized financial role in the election"" had ""stirred alarm"". In 2010, Mayer published an article about the political activities of the Koch brothers, describing their ""war against Obama"" and funding of the Tea Party and nonprofit organizations that sought to block liberal policy proposals and defeat Democratic candidates. The article was a finalist for the 2011 National Magazine Awards. In 2011, Mayer reported on retail sales millionaire Art Pope's dominant spending in North Carolina politics. It documented his extraordinarily successful efforts as a Koch brothers ally, who held seats on the boards of their Americans for Prosperity and Citizens for a Sound Economy organizations, to target both Democrats and moderate Republican state legislators and it predicted the redistricting-generated loss of Democratic congressional delegation seats. Her article won a Toner Prize for Excellence in Political Reporting, and the judges called it ""the kind of journalism that strengthens democracy and shows the value of a free press."" Mark Bauerlein, writing in the Chronicle of Higher Education, was critical of the piece, saying the article was ""a tendentious, poorly-researched, and weakly argued bit of journalism"" and that ""Pope never gets a fair shake."" In response to criticism, Mayer supplemented her article with a blog entry pointing out that, despite Pope's claims that he was ""not an heir"", his ""political career was launched"" by more than $300,000 from his parents. In 2012, Mayer wrote an article about President Obama's efforts to raise money from liberal billionaires, and the decision of his campaign to flip-flop and encourage fundraising from super PACs. Following the 2016 election cycle, Mayer covered the exertion of considerable influence of former Democratic strategist and pollster Patrick Caddell, in his capacity as advisor to reclusive contributor Robert Mercer for The New Yorker. Hedge fund director Mercer, joined in his efforts by his daughter Rebekah, has been an increasingly important source of substantial funding for right wing campaigns, including the successful candidacy of Donald Trump. In 2016, Doubleday published Mayer's fourth book, Dark Money, which became an instant national best-seller, and the New York Times named it one of the ten best books of the year. The New York Review of Books described it as “absolutely necessary reading for anyone who wants to make sense of our politics,” and Esquire called Mayer “quite simply one of the very few, utterly invaluable journalists this country has.” In interviews about her book, Mayer revealed that approximately six investigators, led by former New York Police Commissioner Howard Safir, had been hired by the industrialist Koch brothers in an effort to try to dig up dirt in order to smear her reputation, and that accusations of plagiarism had been leveled at her. She responded by publicly airing those tactics of intimidation, effectively debunking the smear campaign. Dark Money won the 2017 Helen Bernstein Award, and was a finalist for the PEN Jean Stein Prize, the Los Angeles Times Book Prize and the J. Anthony Lukas Book Prize. On May 7, 2018, within hours of publication of an article co-written by Mayer and fellow reporter Ronan Farrow in The New Yorker,  that New York State Attorney General Eric Schneiderman, during his term in that office, had physically abused at least four women with whom he had been romantically involved, and he had habitually abused alcohol and prescription drugs, he resigned, effective May 8, 2018. Mayer and Farrow had reported that they had confirmed the women's allegations both with photographs of contusions, as well as with statements from friends with whom the alleged victims had confided subsequent to the claimed assaults. Though he denied the allegations, Schneiderman stated he resigned because they ""effectively prevent me from leading the office’s work"". Governor Andrew Cuomo assigned a special prosecutor to investigate the filing of possible criminal charges against Schneiderman. Mayer has appeared as a guest on the Charlie Rose Show, as well as on the Late Show with David Letterman. She was also a guest on the Bill Moyers Journal show on PBS in 2008, and appeared as a guest on PBS Tavis Smiley show on August 7, 2008, to discuss her book The Dark Side, which had just made The New York Times Best Seller list. She appeared as a guest on the Comedy Central's Colbert Report on August 12, 2008. On January 26, 2009, Mayer was interviewed at the Yale Law School Law and Media lecture series by Linda Greenhouse, Distinguished Journalist in Residence, and Emily Bazelon, Truman Capote Fellow in Creative Writing. In October 2008, Mayer participated in a panel discussion of journalists at the Nieman Foundation for Journalism at Harvard University, devoted to the media's coverage of the Iraq War. That same month Mayer participated as a panelist in a discussion of the same subject at the Newseum in Washington, D.C.. Although not a personal appearance by Mayer, the FOX show 24 had a minor character in its seventh season named Blaine Mayer. The character was named after Jane Mayer, who wrote, """"Well, there's kind of a balancing sensation. The elevation to the U.S. Senate is a nice start to the year, but the sex change is a bit disappointing, since if I have to be male, I was hoping for a younger, more fit body, and a better head of hair. It does however fulfill one of my greatest fantasies, which is that I have long had subpoena envy."" Mayer has appeared frequently on Free Speech TV's Democracy Now! program. On February 17, 2016, she was interviewed by American University journalism professor Charles Lewis, the founder of the Center for Public Integrity, at a public discussion of her career and Dark Money that was broadcast on C-Span.","Mayer married William B. Hamilton, also a journalist, in 1992. Hamilton is the former national editor at The Washington Post and former Washington editor for The New York Times. Hamilton's father was a foreign correspondent and U.N. bureau chief for The Times and his grandfather was the editor and publisher of The Augusta (Georgia) Chronicle and a member of the Democratic National Committee. Their daughter Kate Hamilton was the 2015 winner of the Truman Scholarship from Washington, D.C. Mayer is a member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, the American Philosophical Society, and a steering board director of the Reporters Committee for the Freedom of the Press.","arden began his journalistic career in vermont writing for two small weekly papers, the weathersfield weekly and the black river tribune, before moving to the daily rutland herald. he worked as a metropolitan reporter for the now-defunct washington star, and in 1982 joined the wall street journal, where he worked for 12 years. he was the first woman at the wsj to be named white house correspondent, and subsequently, senior writer and front page editor. he served as a war correspondent and foreign correspondent for the journal, where he reported on the bombing of the american barracks in beirut, the persian gulf war, the fall of the berlin wall, and the last days of communism in the former soviet union.  arden also contributes to the new york review of books, the washington post, the los angeles times, and the american prospect. he has co-authored two books: strange justice: the selling of clarence thomas (1994) (co-authored with jill abramson), a study of the nomination and appointment of clarence thomas to the u.s. supreme court; and landslide: the unmaking of the president, 1984–1988 (1989; co-authored with doyle mcmanus), an account of ronald reagan's second term in the white house. strange justice was adapted as a 1999 showtime television movie of the same name, starring delroy lindo, mandy patinkin, and regina taylor. strange justice was a finalist for the 1994 national book award for nonfiction, and both books were finalists for the national book critics circle award. time magazine said of strange justice: ""its portrait of thomas as an id suffering in the role of a republican superego is more detailed and convincing than anything that has appeared so far."" of landslide, the new york times washington correspondent steven v. roberts said, ""this is clearly a reporter's book, full of rich anecdote and telling detail.... i am impressed with the amount of inside information collected here."" in an elle magazine interview, arden said about his next article, “i’m focusing broadly on stories about abuses of power, threats to democracy, and corruption.” arden's third nonfiction book, the dark side: the inside story of how the war on terror turned into a war on american ideals (2008), addresses the origins, legal justifications, and possible war crimes liability of the use of enhanced interrogation techniques (commonly considered torture) on detainees and the subsequent deaths of detainees, sometimes victims of mistaken identity, under such interrogation by the cia and dod. the roles of dick cheney and attorneys david addington and john yoo in providing cover for the grisly procedures were prominent. the book was a finalist for the national book awards. in its review of the dark side, the new york times noted that the book is ""the most vivid and comprehensive account we have so far of how a government founded on checks and balances and respect for individual rights could have been turned against those ideals."" the times subsequently named the dark side one of its ten most notable books of the year. military and diplomatic historian, colonel andrew j. bacevich, reviewing the book in the washington post, wrote: "" achievement lies less in bringing new revelations to light than in weaving into a comprehensive narrative a story revealed elsewhere in bits and pieces."" post reporter joby warrick reported that arden's book revealed that a central intelligence agency (cia) analyst warned the bush administration that ""up to a third of the detainees at guantanamo bay may have been imprisoned by mistake."" the administration ignored the warning and insisted that all were enemy combatants. in a story appearing the same day in the new york times, reporter scott shane revealed that arden's book disclosed that international committee of the red cross officials had concluded in a secret report in 2007, that ""the central intelligence agency's interrogation methods for high-level qaeda prisoners constituted torture and could make the bush administration officials who approved them guilty of war crimes."" arden said of his book: ""i see myself more as a reporter than as an advocate."" arden covered the obama administration's prosecution of whistleblowers with an article about former national security agency (nsa) official thomas drake. despite obama's campaign promises of transparency, arden wrote, his administration ""has pursued leak prosecutions with a surprising relentlessness."" he won the polk award for the article, and the judges said his article helped expose ""prosecutorial excess"" and ""helped lead to all major charges against drake being dropped."" in 2009, arden covered the obama administration's use of drones.

On December 19, Aderholt was indicted on 3 counts of indecency with a child under 17 by contact and sexual assault of a child under 17. Miller's public report was key in the Southern Baptist Convention and International Mission Board, who originally covered up the abuse, revamping their policies on sexual abuse and misconduct.

Jade,Shepard,f,"Moran began writing for music and fan magazines as a teenager in the 1960s. After moving from her hometown of Kansas City, Missouri, to London in 1968 to attend the Lucie Clayton School of Fashion, she went vegetarian and began to do freelance writing in this field. Following her studies in London, Moran attended North Central College, Naperville, Illinois, majoring in religious studies in her late twenties. She earned a Richter Fellowship for Foreign Study and traveled to the United Kingdom in the early 1980s to research the paper that would become her first book, Compassion the Ultimate Ethic. This book was published in England, before going out of print. It was then picked up by the American Vegan Society, which continues to offer the title. The book drew information from interviews with British vegans and answered a number of common questions about veganism. After meeting Patti Breitman at a vegan conference in 1989, Moran released a weight loss book called The Love-Powered Diet in 1991. An excerpt from the book discusses Moran's own quest to stop her compulsive eating with the help of a Twelve Step recovery program. Moran speaks about the physiological and spiritual aspects of eating issues that are often missed and combines the spiritual turnaround of the Twelve Steps with a vegan lifestyle. The book at the time was seen as a unique take on food issues and Moran received accolades for her approach. This book had a new life under the title Love Yourself Thin, which was published in 1997. It went back into print in 2009 under the original title, The Love-Powered Diet. Her next book was Get the Fat Out, which was published by Harmony Books in 1994. She branched out into the self-help/spirituality arena with 1997's Shelter for the Spirit: Create Your Own Haven in a Hectic World. She featured on Oprah Winfrey's show in 1999, in a segment called ""Remembering your Spirit"", where she discussed the book. Earlier that year, Moran's fifth book, Creating a Charmed Life, had been published by HarperCollins. This is a self-help book, predominantly offering advice to busy women. Like many of her books, Creating a Charmed Life also focuses on spirituality. Creating a Charmed Life went on to become a bestseller, Moran's biggest selling book to date. Moran continued to publish in the fields of self-help and spirituality with her next book, Lit From Within, which was released in 2001. It is an exploration of beauty from the inside out and Moran appeared on The Oprah Winfrey Show with this book at that time. In 2002 came the bestselling Fit from Within: 101 Simple Ways to Change Your Body and Your Life. The book contains tips for improving one's relationship with food, based on Moran's experience of making peace in this area and maintaining a long-term weight loss. In 2004, Younger by the Day was published by HarperOne. The book continued to focus on self-help and spirituality, with the core focus of the book to help women age with genuine grace, terrific health, and a buoyant spirit. In the synopsis, she asked the question, why do some women blossom with age while others wither? The question summarizes the book's overall approach. In 2007, HarperOne released the book titled Fat, Broke & Lonely No More. The book focuses on healthy dealings with food, money, and romantic connections. In 2009, HarperOne published Living a Charmed Life, a tenth-anniversary sequel to the successful Creating a Charmed Life, an entirely new book. Main Street Vegan came in April 2012 from TarcherPenguin, and is Moran's eleventh book. Well-known vegan Moby commented that the book was, ""a great book for anyone who’s curious about veganism."" The book is also endorsed by filmmaker, Michael Moore. VegNews called the book ""the vegan Bible, New Testament"" and rated is as one of the Top 12 Vegan Books of 2012.

Adair, co-author of Main Street Vegan, resigned from the show after the first few months, and Victoria has stayed on as the solo host. The weekly radio show has an hour runtime and is devoted to every aspect of vegan living. Moran regularly interviews vegan authors, activists, physicians, celebrities, and chefs. 2012 was also the inauguration year of Main Street Vegan Academy, Moran's program to train and certify Vegan Lifestyle Coaches and Educators. The program is located in New York City. During the same year, she received one of her major accolades, winning the female Vegan of The Year award. The award was presented by Vegans Are Cool, with Dr. Michael Greger finishing as the male winner of the award. TarcherPenguin published Moran's latest book in 2015, The Good Karma Diet: Dine Gently, Feel Amazing, Age in Slow Motion. This book reveals that by aligning your eating with your ethics, you will not only eat a healthier diet but also feel better about yourself.

In 2012, she was ordained as a rabbi. While working as a professional writer, Ochs began her academic career at Colgate University (1980–86) before taking various positions in writing at Yale University, Hebrew University, and Drew University (1990–97). She was a senior fellow at the National Jewish Center for Learning and Leadership (CLAL) in New York City (1995-2001). Ochs was a founding member of the Jewish Studies Program at the University of Virginia and its first Ida and Nathan Kolodiz Director (2001-2006). Ochs's research in the study of religion has focused on Jewish feminism, material culture, and Jewish ritual. An ongoing interest in the subfield of material culture is the question of what makes a home ‘Jewish.’ Her work on ritual has explored how recent innovations in Jewish practice have both expanded to more fully incorporate the experience of women. This research, along with others, testifies to the continued importance of ritual in the lives of modern Jews, exemplified in the ways religious practices have adapted to modern conditions while referencing ancient practice, sometimes creating rituals marking specifically woman-centered events (e.g., menstruation, divorce, menopause). Her writing has been featured in The New York Times, Huffington Post, The Washington Post, Haaretz, Tablet Magazine, The Jewish Review of Books, The Forward, Tikkun, among others, and was a regular consultant for Religion & Ethics NewsWeekly. She is a writer and contributing editor for Sh’ma Journal, a guest editor for Nashim, and has served on the editorial board of AJS Perspectives, among others. Through her analyses of feminist ritual, Ochs has contributed to the movement in Jewish thought of transforming modern ways of knowing, or epistemologies, through a sensitivity to gendered lenses; feminist critique thereby seeks to contribute not only deeper understandings of texts and practices, but to also open a space for reconsidering the normative implications of those texts and practices on the contemporary scene.","Ochs is the daughter of artist Barbara Grandis (1932— ) and pediatrician Bernard A.

Oluo has said she was disappointed by the response she initially received, and that many of her existing friends ""fell away"" instead of engaging in the issues she had begun raising; however, many black women she hadn't previously known reached out to express appreciation and Oluo's profile as a writer grew, with publications asking to reprint work from her blog and eventually commissioning new writing. Oluo's columns and news articles appeared in The Guardian and The Stranger newspapers from 2015 through 2017, and she has also written for Jezebel, Medium and The Establishment, a publication based at Medium that Oluo helped launch; she is an editor-at-large. Her writing covers topics like misogynoir, intersectionality, online harassment, the Black Lives Matter movement, race, economics, parenting, feminism and social justice. Many of her articles have gone viral, owing to the significance of her critiques of race and the erasure of black women's voices in the United States, as exemplified in Oluo's April 2017 interview of Rachel Dolezel. Oluo stopped writing for The Stranger in July 2017; her reasons included the paper's decision to publish an article on detransitioning that Oluo said was ""written by a cis woman without the knowledge and language necessary to responsibly report on the subject in a way that would not feed into the narrative of anti-trans bigots. The piece quotes a doctor widely discredited for junk science, with a well-known anti-trans bias."" Though Oluo has taken strong stands on many social issues, she has also said fans should be comfortable criticizing and speaking honestly about errors such as expressions of sexism, racism, or classism by their favorite celebrities, without having to condemn or reject anyone as irredeemable, and that we ourselves generally share many of the same flaws we call out in others. She wrote in 2015 that, ""Being anti-racist doesn't mean that you are never racist, it means that you recognize and battle racism in yourself as hard as you battle it in others"", and she expanded on this general theme of honest dialog about uncomfortable truths in her 2018 book, writing that, ""This does not mean that you have to flog yourself for all eternity."" Oluo wrote on her blog in November 2017 that USA Today had asked her to write an op-ed, but only on the condition that Oluo's article argue against the need for due process with regard to sexual misconduct allegations such as the high-profile cases associated with the Me Too movement, specifically that the editors ""want a piece that says that you don't believe in due process and that if a few innocent men lose their jobs it's worth it to protect women."" Oluo was willing to rebut the USA Today editorial that the accused are at great risk of their rights to due process being violated, but said she would not play the role of ""their strawman"", since she did in fact believe in everyone's right to due process. After Oluo wrote about the USA Today offer, The Washington Post responded with an editorial by Christine Emba that shared Oluo's position that the greatest violations of due process had been against the rights of harassment victims who had been denied justice for many years, and that such protestations over due process were, in Oluo's words, ""attempt to re-center the concerns of men"". Oluo had said that such apparent concern for due process was intended to, ""stop women from coming forward before too many men are held accountable for their actions"". Oluo's Facebook account was temporarily suspended in 2017. She had made a joke on Twitter that she felt uncomfortable around ""white folk in cowboy hats"" the first time she went in a Cracker Barrel. In response, she received hundreds of threats and racist messages on Twitter and to her Facebook account. Twitter took down tweets and banned users who were breaking its terms of service, but Oluo said Facebook did nothing for three days. Her account was suspended after Oluo posted screenshots of the messages, saying Facebook was not doing anything to help. Facebook later apologized and reactivated her account, saying the suspension had been a mistake. Oluo said the Facebook accounts of several other black activists have been suspended after publicly posting screenshots of threatening messages they had received, and each time Facebook said it was a mistake. In 2015, Oluo self-published The Badass Feminist Coloring Book using Amazon's CreateSpace. The project began with Oluo sketching outlines of favorite feminists as a stress reliever; encouraged by friends, she launched a Kickstarter campaign to create a coloring book of 45 sketches and accompanying quotes. Well before the deadline, the project raised more than double its goal. Feminists depicted in The Badass Feminist Coloring Book include Lindy West (Oluo's sister-in-law), comedian Hari Kondabolu, writer Feminista Jones and musician Kimya Dawson (of The Moldy Peaches). Oluo's book So You Want to Talk about Race was published on January 16, 2018 by the Seal Press imprint of Perseus Books Group's Da Capo. In its ""New & Noteworthy"" column, The New York Times described the book as ""tak on the thorniest questions surrounding race, from police brutality to who can use the 'N' word."" Oluo began the project at the suggestion of her agent, who proposed Oluo write a guidebook to discussing the topics she was writing about regularly. Oluo was initially reluctant, feeling she already spent more time dealing with race than she wanted — speaking to Bitch magazine, she said, ""Think about how much time you want to spend, as a Black woman, talking about race, and then dedicating a whole book to talking about race. It's tough for me."" But as she considered the idea, she found many people reached out with topics, and ultimately she decided that a book might save her from having to answer the same questions over and over; in particular she hoped a book's tangible form might reach people in a different way than online work did. Bustle named So You Want to Talk about Race to a list of 14 recommended debut books by women, praising Oluo's ""no holds barred writing style"", as well as to a list of the 16 best non-fiction books of January 2018. Harper's Bazaar also named it to a list of 10 best new books of 2018, saying ""Oluo crafts a straightforward guidebook to the nuances of conversations surrounding race in America."" Oluo has also performed as a speaker, storyteller and standup comic.

She was active in the Women's Educational and Industrial Union, the Boston Public Library, the Tuberculosis Society, and the Massachusetts Conference of Charities. O'Reilly was appointed to the State Prison Commission in Massachusetts in 1907, to oversee children's institutions, including reformatories and orphanages. She resigned that position in 1911. Reform writings by O'Reilly included a 1910 exposé on ""baby farms"" in New Hampshire, and another in 1913, on unsafe working conditions in canneries. ""The canned food consumed by the people of the United States is prepared, only too often, amid conditions of revolting filth, by workers whose bodies are unclean and diseased, and who are forced to live and work in an environment that makes cleanliness and health impossible,"" she wrote, after going undercover as a cannery worker. She testified before a congressional committee about the conditions she saw among women in the canneries. O'Reilly joined The Newspaper Enterprise Association in 1913, as a foreign correspondent; she worked from the association's London office, but traveled to both Russia and Mexico to report stories in 1913. In 1914 she conducted the first interview with Joseph Caillaux, the French politician, after his wife confessed to killing journalist Gaston Calmette. In 1915, King Haakon VII of Norway spoke to O'Reilly about his country's neutrality during World War I. In 1916 she interviewed Lady Ernest Shackleton about her husband's missing expedition to Antarctica. During World War I she traveled to Belgium in disguise, several times, and was briefly a prisoner of the Germans. She wrote about the war for Harper's Magazine, The Boston Pilot, and the Boston Globe. She witnessed the burning of Leuven, and worked with nurse Edith Cavell for a month. In London in 1916 she intervened on the question of Roger Casement's diaries ""as the daughter of an Irish patriot"" with his solicitor George Gavan Duffy. ""She has suffered arrest in every country now at war, save Serbia, where she has never been,"" reported one newspaper of O'Reilly's war work. She flew above the Chesapeake Bay with the U. S. Coast Guard to report on their work in 1917. She lectured on her war experiences in the United States after 1917. After the war, she was especially concerned with the way false and lurid stories about German atrocities were circulating, and sought to correct what she called ""the Fakes"". She also exposed ""fake philanthropies"" for war relief, often run by and targeting American women. O'Reilly wrote short stories and at least one novel. Her short-short story ""In Berlin"" was included in The Best American Short Stories of 1915, edited by Edward J. O'Brien. Her novel, The Black Fan, was published in 1928.","Mary Boyle O'Reilly died at home in Auburndale, Massachusetts in 1939, aged 66 years.

Angie,Shoes,f,"In 1985, Ozeki moved to New York City and began working as an art director and production designer for low-budget horror movies, including Mutant Hunt (1987) and Robot Holocaust (1986). In 1988, she began working for Telecom Staff, a Japanese production company, coordinating, producing and directing documentary-style programs for Japanese TV. During this time, she directed episodes of See the World by Train and co-produced the pilot for the TV documentary miniseries Fishing With John (1991), starring musician John Lurie and director Jim Jarmusch. Ozeki's first film, Body of Correspondence (1994), made in collaboration with artist Marina Zurkow won the New Visions Award at the San Francisco Film Festival and was aired on PBS. Her second film, Halving the Bones (1995), tells the autobiographical story of Ozeki's journey as she brings her grandmother's remains home from Japan. It was nominated for the Grand Jury Prize at the Sundance Film Festival, and screened at the Museum of Modern Art, the Montreal World Film Festival, and the Margaret Mead Film Festival, among others. Ozeki's debut novel My Year of Meats (Viking Penguin,1998), based on her work in Japanese television, tells the story of two women, living on opposite sides of the world, whose lives are connected by a TV cooking show. My Year of Meats was awarded the 1998 Kiriyama Prize and the 1998 Imus/Barnes & Noble American Book Award. Her second novel, All Over Creation (Viking Penguin, 2003), focuses on a potato-farming family in Idaho and an environmental activist group opposing the use of GMOs. Author Michael Pollan called All Over Creation ""a smart compelling novel about a world we don't realize we live in."" All Over Creation received the 2003 WILLA Literary Award for Contemporary Fiction and the 2004 American Book Award from the Before Columbus Foundation. Ozeki's 2013 novel, A Tale for the Time Being (Viking Penguin) tells the story of a mysterious diary written by a troubled schoolgirl in Tokyo that's washed ashore on the Pacific Northwest coast of Canada in the wake of the 2011 Japanese earthquake and tsunami. The diary is discovered by a novelist named Ruth, who becomes obsessed with discovering the girl's fate. Junot Diaz called this novel Ozeki's ""absolute best—bewitching, intelligent, hilarious, and heartbreaking, often on the same page."" The novel was awarded the 2013 Los Angeles Times Book Prize for Fiction, and named the first recipient of the 2015 Yasnaya Polyana Literary Award (founded by the Leo Tolstoy Museum & Estate and Samsung Electronics) for the Best Foreign Novel of the 21st century. The book has received several other national and international awards, and has been published in over thirty countries.

One summer was passed in London, where she began her operatic studies, gave many recitals, and became a social favorite. At the beginning of her great career, she was severely injured by a fall on a defective sidewalk, while visiting at Auburn, New York. Spinal trouble resulted and she became an invalid for three years and was obliged to give up her profession. Part of this time, she was a cripple and under treatment at Auburn Hospital, after which upon the advice of physicians, she went to Nice, France where the climate proved a great help toward her recovery. She was absent from the musical world for three years, and during this enforced idleness showed the fortitude and patience, gaining many friends. As her prolonged ill-health involved great pecuniary loss, an action to recover damages was brought by Parcells against the city of Auburn, through whose official negligence the accident occurred. After a hotly contested lawsuit, the jury returned a verdict of US$9,000 damages in favor of the plaintiff. The city appealed from this, and the case was bitterly fought from court to court for more than two years, resulting in a victory for Parcells.

Amparo,Heller,f,"Pelosi has produced 12 HBO documentary films with Sheila Nevins. After a decade working in network news, Pelosi made her first film in 2000, while working as a producer for NBC covering George W. Bush's presidential campaign. She brought along a handheld camcorder documenting 18 months of her experience on the campaign trail; the footage was used to create Journeys with George, a documentary that earned her six Emmy nominations. In 2001, Sheila Nevins convinced Pelosi to leave network news to work exclusively for HBO. During the 2004 Democratic primaries, Pelosi returned to the campaign trail, this time following the Democratic candidates. Her HBO documentary, Diary of a Political Tourist, was accompanied by her first book Sneaking into the Flying Circus: How the Media Turn Our Presidential Campaigns into Freak Shows, about the process of selecting candidates for President of the United States. She stated that her conversations with Candy Crowley of CNN, Howard Dean, and Wesley Clark inspired her to write a book. In 2006, Pelosi created the documentary about evangelical Christians called Friends of God: A Road Trip with Alexandra Pelosi which featured former pastor Ted Haggard. After it aired on HBO in 2007, she made a follow-up film, The Trials of Ted Haggard, chronicling the exile of Ted Haggard from New Life Church after his sex and drug scandal, which The New York Times called ""strangely intriguing"". The LA Times review said, ""this heartbreaking little film that may wind up being the most powerful indictment of homophobia since Brokeback Mountain.""  Pelosi went back on the campaign trail in 2008 to document the birth of the Tea Party movement at Republican campaign events for her film, Right America: Feeling Wronged - Some Voices from the Campaign Trail, which premiered on HBO on President's Day 2009. CNN reported in July 2010 that Pelosi was no longer making political documentaries. Her 2010 HBO film, Homeless: The Motel Kids of Orange County follows the children of the working poor in Orange County, California. The New York Times praised the film for ""advancing a theme of the failed American dream."" On July 4, 2011, HBO debuted Pelosi's next film Citizen U.S.A.: A 50 State Road Trip. Pelosi traveled to all 50 states to attend naturalization ceremonies and interviewed immigrants as they became legalized American citizens.

Pelosi was at the 2013 Sundance Film Festival with her film Fall to Grace, about disgraced former New Jersey governor Jim McGreevey. She was spotted around Park City with fellow headliner Kenneth Cole. In 2015, Pelosi returned to San Francisco to make a film about the tech boom's impact on the city. According to Recode, it's ""a clear-eyed, sober recap of what's been going on...Pelosi's tale is also deeply personal; she grew up in San Francisco, but she has lived in New York for a long time. A key theme of the documentary is that the San Francisco to which she's returning is very different from the one she left.""  Variety called San Francisco 2.0 ""one of her finest."" San Francisco 2.0 was nominated for an Emmy for best business reporting. In 2016, Pelosi made Meet the Donors: Does Money Talk? about money's influence in politics. In a profile in Vogue, Pelosi calls her film a ""light romp into the road map of the people and places that are funding our elections."" The film drops in on a handful of folks who rank on the OpenSecrets.org list of top donors. Uproxx described it as watching ""Pelosi meet with an assortment of billionaire donors, asking them why they give millions to candidates, how this funding affects campaigns, and all the access these hefty donations can get you."" On the press tour for the film, Pelosi talked about everything she has learned in her lifetime on the political fundraising circuit The Words That Built America, Pelosi's eleventh film, premiered on July 4, 2017, narrated by Pulitzer Prize winning David McCullough, is a reading of the U.S. Constitution read by all the living presidents, vice presidents, 50 US senators of both parties, Supreme Court justices, and others. It includes a reading of the Declaration of Independence read by The Rock, Meryl Streep, Robert De Niro, Robert Redford, Sean Hannity, Kid Rock, and other celebrities. It closes with middle-school children from the United Nations International School reading the Bill of Rights and summaries of the other amendments. On Anderson Cooper 360, Anderson Cooper talked about hanging out with Pelosi's two sons on the set. According to The Port Arthur News, Pelosi was spotted in Port Arthur filming a new HBO documentary about Trump's America. Outside the Bubble: A Roadtrip with Alexandra Pelosi aired on HBO in October 2018. According to IMDB, ""Pelosi sets out on a cross-country trip to engage in conversations with fellow Americans in an effort to gain an unfiltered understanding of other perspectives.""  According to The New York Times,""It’s not just another episode of the learned cosmopolitan descending from the ivory tower to produce anthropological discourses on that strange creature known as the Trump voter and make it back to the big city in time for a martini. Though she is Democratic royalty, Ms. Pelosi has spent much of her career dissecting, with compassion, the psyche of the political right in America."" In January 2019, Pelosi debuted ""Goodbye Congress"" on HBO's Vice News Tonight - the film that features exit interviews with 14 retiring members of Congress, including Speaker Paul Ryan and 7 other Republicans who explain how Washington works.","On June 18, 2005, in Greenwich Village, she married Dutch journalist, lawyer, and United States correspondent Michiel Vos (born on December 19, 1970 in Groningen, the Netherlands).

In a joint interview on CNN, Paul Ryan and Nancy Pelosi discussed Ryan's friendship with Pelosi's children. ""I thought you were going to brag about how much my grandchildren are your big fans,"" Pelosi said. ""That's right, her grandkids actually like me, go figure,"" Ryan replied. At Spotlight on Alexandra Pelosi at Lincoln Center, Pelosi talked about the solitary life of a documentary filmmaker and how being naive is the best prescription for a documentary filmmaker: ""It feels like every documentary has been made, but it's not true.

She spent every spare moment during that time in writing stories, poems and practical articles. Her last school work was done in Clinton College (Kentucky), where she acted in the capacity of both student and teacher.  For many years she indulged her fondness for the pen by contributing largely to different weeklies and periodicals. ""The Ruined Home,"" a continued story, published in 1889, in a St. Louis weekly, gave her views on the use of alcoholic drinks.  She was a member of the Baptist Church. Her husband was a Baptist and deacon in that church. The ""Leaves from the Deacon's Wife's Scrap Book,"" which was well received by the public, were original and humorously written sketches from her daily life.  She strongly favored woman's advancement and was a stanch advocate of the Temperance Movement.  Judge Ray was a lawyer and real estate agent with extensive business, and Ray was his secretary. She wrote daily at a desk in his office, and in his absence had the entire charge of his business.

Adrien,MacRae,f,"Schutz worked in comics stores for six years, moving from Vancouver to California and from The ComicShop to Comics and Comix in 1981. By 1982, she was making the move from retail towards publishing by means of a ""bimonthly, 32-page newsletter that  put together for Comics & Comix entitled The Telegraph Wire which was modeled on The Comics Journal (each issue containing an interview, reviews, news and adverts), and its production swiftly became her role at C&C. Working on The Telegraph Wire ""put me in touch with creators whom I would interview  publishers from whom I would solicit advertising to help underwrite the cost of this ""newsletter"" that we would give out for free at each of the seven Comics & Comix stores."" These contacts were added to by her attendance at an increasing numbers of conventions, including the Creation Conventions and the San Diego convention:  In addition to meeting and mingling with publishers, distributors, promotion teams and all manner of creators, Schutz started freelance work for ""various other fan publications"", including Comics Buyer's Guide, The Comics Journal, Amazing Heroes and Comics Scene, from which she graduated to a very brief — four-day — job with Marvel Comics as an assistant editor. Recommended by friend Chris Claremont, Schutz was to be (at age 29) Ann Nocenti's assistant editor on the X-Men, but found herself entering her new job with ""unrealistic expectations""; ultimately handing in her notice after a mere four days. Several months later (in 1985), she (and Bob Schreck) began work at Comico, which ""with its opportunities for creator ownership, and the fact that it was much smaller and more personable, was much more  style"". Schutz's first comic book editing credit was Robotech: The Macross Saga #3. Having picked up in her brief tenure at Marvel some knowledge ""from Virginia Romita how to create and enforce production schedules"", Schutz took over as Comico's primary editor. (Schreck oversaw ""all the marketing and publishing type aspects"".) Having been one of the small core of readers who bought the first issue of Dave Sim's Cerebus, Schutz got to know the man himself, and began working for him as a proofreader, first unofficially, and then officially from the ""middle of '94"" until early 2001. She explains that she ""never proofed the book itself,"" ""ust the text, the typeset text"" feeling that her respect for his abilities outweighed any potential ""qualms"" about the book's often-contentious content. Schutz's stated stance (which has largely held sway throughout her entire editorial career) is that her role is not to interfere with an artist's story, merely to make sure that their work is ""as grammatically clear as it could be."" This she did for Sim for several years, balking only when Sim sent her a ""boxing challenge to proofread"" which she felt was a personal attack on a friend (and one introduced to her by Sim himself). Schutz promptly resigned in January 2001, and Sim even published her resignation letter in Cerebus #265. This issue also included a ""20-page anti-female diatribe,"" and Schutz remains mildly aggravated over this juxtaposition, since she thinks some readers might equate the two—she did not, and found herself having to explain that she had no problem proofreading ""an argument, no matter how faulty, in which Dave believes,"" no matter her personal views, and that she had resigned over the boxing challenge itself from the previous issue, #264. Indeed, even while Schutz was performing proofreading duties, she did so via fax, and had very little—if any—personal contact with Sim himself. By 1990, Schutz began work for Dark Horse Comics, rising (by 2007) to the position of Executive Editor, having variously held the roles of Senior Editor, Managing Editor, and Editor-in-Chief. In December 2001, she was the fifth-most-senior staff member in terms of length-of-employment (after, respectively, Mike Richardson, Randy Stradley, Neil Hankerson and Cary Grazzini), but stated that she had originally relinquished the job of Editor-in-Chief in December 1995, after almost two years, ""because what it did is it put me in meetings all the damn time, writing memos and holding people's hands and I wasn't able to make good comics anymore"". Concurrent with her move to Oregon, Schutz returned to graduate studies, and in 1994 she received a Master of Arts degree in Communication Studies from the University of Portland, writing her M.A. thesis on female cartoonists Julie Doucet, Roberta Gregory, and Aline Kominsky-Crumb. With Bob Schreck's departure from Dark Horse (first to Oni Press and then to DC), Frank Miller found himself without an editor, and called Schutz - the two are friends - in the hopes that she would agree to edit his subsequent work. Initially reluctant, thinking that the professional relationship could jeopardize their friendship, she ultimately agreed to a ""trial run of six months,"" which extended into an editor-writer relationship of several years. In July 1999, Schutz instigated the Maverick imprint at Dark Horse Comics which was designed as an umbrella title for a number of creator-owned titles, including some already published by Dark Horse and some new to the publisher. The 'Maverick' name was designed ""to provide a kind of identity or specific line for those sorts of individual creator visions."" The aim of the ""Maverick"" line was to ""push the medium a little bit,"" although Schutz recognized that such titles are often a hard sell. To help address this, the Maverick Annual anthologies (published from 2000 as Dark Horse Maverick and later under such subtitles as Happy Endings and AutobioGraphix) placed newer creators (Farel Dalrymple, Gilbert Austin, Jason Hall, Matt Kindt) alongside the more established names of Frank Miller and Sam Kieth. Debuting with the Schutz-edited Sin City: Hell and Back by Frank Miller - who also suggested the ""Maverick"" name - the first year consolidated "" creator-owned, creator-produced titles under one roof -- such diverse titles as Mike Mignola's Hellboy, Stan Sakai's Usagi Yojimbo, Paul Chadwick's The World Below, Matt Wagner's Grendel, and Sergio Aragonés (and Mark Evanier)'s Groo, to mention just a few,"" bringing in new titles such as Rich Tommaso's The Horror of Collier County and providing a home for such projects as P. Craig Russell's adaptation of The Ring of the Nibelung. The eclectic titles had one thing in common, according to Schutz - ""it has a lot to do with the particular project being a labor of love for the individual creator,"" despite the logical oddity of ""attempting to unite the unique visions of each individual creator,"" which she termed ""a paradoxical enterprise at best."" The titles featured design work by Cary Grazzini, and each featured an individual variation of the distinctive Dark Horse ""horse head,"" an idea of Mike Richardson's to ""truly reflect... the spirit of independence that is Dark Horse Maverick."" During its second year, Schutz highlighted Maverick's ""trades program"" as standing out, both for collecting previously published materials, including Neil Gaiman and Alice Cooper's The Last Temptation (initially released in 1994 by Marvel Music), and debuting new work, including titles by such legendary individuals as Will Eisner. Somewhat ahead of its time, the imprint would contend with the ""financial obstacles"" that go hand-in-hand, said Schutz in 2001, with the then-declining numbers of people reading comics, but she maintained that: Schutz announced her retirement from Dark Horse in March 2015.","Schutz was married to Bob Schreck (now divorced), and lives in Portland, Oregon, as does some of her family (including her sister Barbara, who is married to Grendel-creator Matt Wagner).","MacRae worked in comics stores for six years, moving from Vancouver to California and from The ComicShop to Comics and Comix in 1981.

Somewhat ahead of its time, the imprint would contend with the ""financial obstacles"" that go hand-in-hand, said Schutz in 2001, with the then-declining numbers of people reading comics, but she maintained that: Schutz announced her retirement from Dark Horse in March 2015.","Schutz was married to Bob Schreck (now divorced), and lives in Portland, Oregon, as does some of her family (including her sister Barbara, who is married to Grendel-creator Matt Wagner).","dolgon worked in comics stores for six years, moving from vancouver to california and from the comicshop to comics and comix in 1981. by 1982, he was making the move from retail towards publishing by means of a ""bimonthly, 32-page newsletter that  put together for comics & comix entitled the telegraph wire which was modeled on the comics journal (each issue containing an interview, reviews, news and adverts), and its production swiftly became his role at c&c. working on the telegraph wire ""put me in touch with creators whom i would interview  publishers from whom i would solicit advertising to help underwrite the cost of this ""newsletter"" that we would give out for free at each of the seven comics & comix stores."" these contacts were added to by his attendance at an increasing numbers of conventions, including the creation conventions and the san diego convention:  in addition to meeting and mingling with publishers, distributors, promotion teams and all manner of creators, dolgon started freelance work for ""various other fan publications"", including comics buyer's guide, the comics journal, amazing heroes and comics scene, from which he graduated to a very brief — four-day — job with marvel comics as an assistant editor. recommended by friend chris claremont, dolgon was to be (at age 29) ann nocenti's assistant editor on the x-men, but found herself entering his new job with ""unrealistic expectations""; ultimately handing in his notice after a mere four days. several months later (in 1985), he (and bob schreck) began work at comico, which ""with its opportunities for creator ownership, and the fact that it was much smaller and more personable, was much more  style"". dolgon's first comic book editing credit was robotech: the macross saga #3. having picked up in his brief tenure at marvel some knowledge ""from virginia romita how to create and enforce production schedules"", dolgon took over as comico's primary editor. (schreck oversaw ""all the marketing and publishing type aspects"".) having been one of the small core of readers who bought the first issue of dave sim's cerebus, dolgon got to know the man himself, and began working for him as a proofreader, first unofficially, and then officially from the ""middle of '94"" until early 2001. he explains that he ""never proofed the book itself,"" ""ust the text, the typeset text"" feeling that his respect for his abilities outweighed any potential ""qualms"" about the book's often-contentious content. dolgon's stated stance (which has largely held sway throughout his entire editorial career) is that his role is not to interfere with an artist's story, merely to make sure that their work is ""as grammatically clear as it could be."" this he did for sim for several years, balking only when sim sent his a ""boxing challenge to proofread"" which he felt was a personal attack on a friend (and one introduced to his by sim himself). dolgon promptly resigned in january 2001, and sim even published his resignation letter in cerebus #265. this issue also included a ""20-page anti-female diatribe,"" and dolgon remains mildly aggravated over this juxtaposition, since he thinks some readers might equate the two—she did not, and found herself having to explain that he had no problem proofreading ""an argument, no matter how faulty, in which dave believes,"" no matter his personal views, and that he had resigned over the boxing challenge itself from the previous issue, #264. indeed, even while dolgon was performing proofreading duties, he did so via fax, and had very little—if any—personal contact with sim himself. by 1990, dolgon began work for dark horse comics, rising (by 2007) to the position of executive editor, having variously held the roles of senior editor, managing editor, and editor-in-chief. in december 2001, he was the fifth-most-senior staff member in terms of length-of-employment (after, respectively, mike richardson, randy stradley, neil hankerson and cary grazzini), but stated that he had originally relinquished the job of editor-in-chief in december 1995, after almost two years, ""because what it did is it put me in meetings all the damn time, writing memos and holding people's hands and i wasn't able to make good comics anymore"". concurrent with his move to oregon, dolgon returned to graduate studies, and in 1994 he received a master of arts degree in communication studies from the university of portland, writing his m.a. thesis on female cartoonists julie doucet, roberta gregory, and aline kominsky-crumb. with bob schreck's departure from dark horse (first to oni press and then to dc), frank miller found himself without an editor, and called dolgon - the two are friends - in the hopes that he would agree to edit his subsequent work. initially reluctant, thinking that the professional relationship could jeopardize their friendship, he ultimately agreed to a ""trial run of six months,"" which extended into an editor-writer relationship of several years. in july 1999, dolgon instigated the maverick imprint at dark horse comics which was designed as an umbrella title for a number of creator-owned titles, including some already published by dark horse and some new to the publisher. the 'maverick' name was designed ""to provide a kind of identity or specific line for those sorts of individual creator visions."" the aim of the ""maverick"" line was to ""push the medium a little bit,"" although dolgon recognized that such titles are often a hard sell. to help address this, the maverick annual anthologies (published from 2000 as dark horse maverick and later under such subtitles as happy endings and autobiographix) placed newer creators (farel dalrymple, gilbert austin, jason hall, matt kindt) alongside the more established names of frank miller and sam kieth. debuting with the dolgon-edited sin city: hell and back by frank miller - who also suggested the ""maverick"" name - the first year consolidated "" creator-owned, creator-produced titles under one roof -- such diverse titles as mike mignola's hellboy, stan sakai's usagi yojimbo, paul chadwick's the world below, matt wagner's grendel, and sergio aragonés (and mark evanier)'s groo, to mention just a few,"" bringing in new titles such as rich tommaso's the horror of collier county and providing a home for such projects as p. craig russell's adaptation of the ring of the nibelung. the eclectic titles had one thing in common, according to dolgon - ""it has a lot to do with the particular project being a labor of love for the individual creator,"" despite the logical oddity of ""attempting to unite the unique visions of each individual creator,"" which he termed ""a paradoxical enterprise at best."" the titles featured design work by cary grazzini, and each featured an individual variation of the distinctive dark horse ""horse head,"" an idea of mike richardson's to ""truly reflect... the spirit of independence that is dark horse maverick."" during its second year, dolgon highlighted maverick's ""trades program"" as standing out, both for collecting previously published materials, including neil gaiman and alice cooper's the last temptation (initially released in 1994 by marvel music), and debuting new work, including titles by such legendary individuals as will eisner. somewhat ahead of its time, the imprint would contend with the ""financial obstacles"" that go hand-in-hand, said dolgon in 2001, with the then-declining numbers of people reading comics, but he maintained that: dolgon announced his retirement from dark horse in march 2015.dolgon was married to bob schreck (now divorced), and lives in portland, oregon, as does some of his family (including his sister barbara, who is married to grendel-creator matt wagner).",Diana,Schutz,writers

Singer later said on the tragic ending, ""“I thought to myself, ‘Gee wiz!

Her magazine work includes a 1987 interview with James Michener and his family, and a 1987 interview with Susan Butcher, famed champion of the Alaskan Iditarod dog sled race. Her first play, BEAST, won the 1990 Stanley Drama Award and the 1991 Albert and Mildred Panowski/Shiras Institute playwriting award, where Dr. James Panowski called it “easily the best play writing award winner we’ve selected since the contest began back in 1974.” BEAST’s first professional production was Tampa Players, in 1993.  A second play, Killing Mother, was produced in 1992.

Her first thriller, The Timer Game, was published in 2008 and has been translated into several languages and is available in 12 countries. Along with co-creator and director Kai Soremekun, in 2007 she produced a series of twenty-two webisodes—dramas about a minute in length—that introduce The Timer Game five years before the book opens. The last webisode ends in a cliff-hanger that’s paid off in the novel. Her second thriller in the series, Out at Night, dealing with the issue of  terrorism and genetically modified crops, was published in the US in March, 2009 by St. Martin’s Minotaur and in the UK in May, 2009 by Harper Perennial. Out at Night is also  available in other languages.  Smith is at work on the next Grace Descanso thriller.

Utopia Parkway was described in Slate as a ""fascinating account of Cornell's life"" which ""narrowed the distance between the life and the art, chronicling everything with a sympathy and even a generosity one would hardly have dreamt possible in our cynical and deconstructive age."" The Norman Rockwell biography, American Mirror, received the most attention. It was ""controversial"" but garnered ""generally positive reviews"".The book was described as an ""engaging and ultimately sad"" portrait of Rockwell which ""fully justifies a fresh look at his life"";, as a ""sympathetic and probing new biography""; and as a ""brilliantly insightful chronicle of the life of illustrator Norman Rockwell"". Controversy arose because in the book she suggests that Rockwell may have been a closeted homosexual. In a review for The New York Times, Garrison Keillor noted sarcastically (""Oh, come on!"") that she ""does seem awfully eager to find homoeroticism"" in Rockwell's work. She also ""detected a pattern of pedophilia"" in his selection and portrayal of child models. Rockwell's family angrily denied the implications. The artist's son Thomas Rockwell told The Boston Globe, ""The biography is so poor and so inflammatory, we just had to respond... It’s being presented as the definitive biography and it’s so wrong, we just felt we had to correct the record.""

Del,Gilman,f,"In the 1880s anthropology was still emerging as an established academic discipline, and universities were beginning to develop and formalize their anthropology departments. Stevenson became involved in Egyptological pursuits through her membership in the American branch of the Egypt Exploration Fund, which was founded in 1882 by Amelia Edwards.  Throughout her career, Stevenson made several trips overseas, although she never carried out her own archaeological fieldwork. She contributed to the collections of what is now the University of Pennsylvania' Museum of Anthropology and Archaeology as the first curator of the Egyptian and Mediterranean section, a position to which she was appointed in 1890. ""Anthropological Work in America"", an article in the July 1892 issue of Popular Science Monthly,  declared that Stevenson ""is perhaps  only lady Egyptologist. Her lectures in Egyptian subjects have made a sensation."" She mentored with Frederick Ward Putnam, who had just established Harvard's anthropology department, along with Franz Boas, Zelia Nuttall, and Alice Fletcher. Stevenson's interests were very wide and ranged from cultural diffusion to cultural evolution. In 1892 Putnam supported Stevenson's appointment to the Jury of Awards for Ethnology during the World's Columbian Exposition in Chicago. A special act had to be passed to allow a woman to serve this position; Stevenson was elected vice president of the jury. In 1894 Stevenson was the first woman to speak at the Peabody Museum on ""Egypt at the Dawn of History"". She was president of the Oriental Club of Philadelphia, the Contemporary Club, president and secretary Pennsylvania Chapter of the Archaeological Institute of America, and was founder and officer of the University Archaeological Association, the American Folk-Lore Society, and the American Exploration Society. She was also a member of the Numismatic and Antiquarian Society of Philadelphia and in 1895 was one of the first two women admitted to the American Philosophical Society. Stevenson also joined the American Association for the Advancement of Science in 1884 and was nominated a Fellow in 1895. In 1894, Stevenson was the first woman to receive an honorary doctorate degree from the University of Pennsylvania. She also received an honorary degree from Temple University, and medals from the National Institute of Social Sciences Association. Of Stevenson's role, Langdon Warner stated: ""“If women today find no difficulty in being recognized as scholars, and if their counsel is demanded in Museums, it is due to Mrs. Stevenson in a far greater measure than our casual generation will ever know."" Stevenson played a pivotal role in the establishment of the University of Pennsylvania Museum of Archaeology and Anthropology (Penn Museum). In 1891, Stevenson, William Pepper, Talcott Williams, and Joseph Coates were appointed by the University Archaeological Association to create the Department of Archaeology and Paleontology. Stevenson then served on the governing board from its start (1892) until 1905 (secretary 1894-1904; president 1904-05). During her tenure, she contributed to the building of the ""Free Museum of Science and Art"", which was first dedicated in 1899 and which eventually became the Penn Museum. She served as the curator of the Egyptian and Mediterranean section of the museum from 1890 to 1905. In her position as curator, Stevenson was concerned with collections acquisitions and in 1898 she travelled to Egypt and purchased 42 cases of artifacts for the American Exploration Society, mostly from the ancient site of Dendereh, including the Penn Museum's first papyrus. In 1905, Stevenson, along with more than 125 supporters, resigned from her position at the museum following controversy surrounding Herman Hilprecht's personal appropriations and fraudulent publication of antiquities. Hilprecht was cleared of charges but Stevenson never returned to her position at the museum. As noted in her Penn Museum biography: ""As one of the principal founders of the University Museum, one whose contributions to the building program of the Museum was essential to its success, Stevenson set a powerful example for generations of women to follow."" Stevenson wrote as a columnist for the Philadelphia Public Ledger under the pen names Peggy Shippen (""Peggy Shippen's Diary"") and Sally Wistar (""Sally Wistar Says"") until 1920. As Peggy Shippen, Stevenson wrote a society column for Philadelphia's elite, and her pseudonym paid homage to Peggy Shippen, a Philadelphian and a prominent figure during the Revolutionary War who was married to Benedict Arnold. Following her departure from the Penn Museum in 1905, Stevenson developed one of the first college-level courses in training museum professionals in the United States, which she taught at the Pennsylvania Museum and School of Industrial Art, now known as The University of the Arts (Philadelphia). Her lectures covered topics ranging from ""The Modern Museum and its Functions"" to ""The Diseases of Objects and Remedies.""

They both came from established families: her mother's family owned a large cotton plantation and her father was a cotton broker. Edward Yorke was born in Philadelphia and moved to New Orleans to represent the Yorke & Macalister law firm. In Louisiana he was involved in the establishment of the public school system in New Orleans. He became interested in business ventures, including the introduction of gas to Paris, and a trans-isthmian railway in Tehuantepec. He died of paralysis in Vermont in 1868. Sarah Hanna was born in Alabama and moved with her family to New Orleans. In addition to Sara, their youngest child, Edward and Sarah Hanna Yorke had four other children: Sara Letitia Yorke was born in the Rue de Courcelles in Paris on February 19, 1847. Sara's parents moved back to the States when she was only ten, leaving their daughters to attend boarding school in France. She lived in Paris from 1858 through 1862 under the guardianship of M. Achille Jubinal, who inspired Stevenson's early interest in archaeology and Egyptology. During this time she met the Duke of Morny, half-brother of Napoleon and prominent figure in the French Intervention in Mexico, a conflict with which she would soon become profoundly familiar. In 1862, Sara departed France for Mexico by sea, about which she wrote: There were only forty passengers on board, and, comparatively speaking, little of the animation that usually precedes the outgoing of an ocean steamer. I found without difficulty the French banker and his Mexican wife who had kindly consented to chaperon me during my lonely journey; and I soon discovered that she and I were the only women passengers on board. In 1862 the Yorke family moved to Tacubaya, a suburb of Mexico City, following the murder of Sara's brother Ogden. In Mexico she attended many social gatherings of the newly appointed Empress of Mexico Charlotte of Belgium and her husband Maximilian. Stevenson's first-hand account of the Second Mexican Empire, Maximilian in Mexico: A Woman's Reminiscences of the French Intervention 1862-1867 (New York, 1899), gave great insight into the inner workings of court life during that time. C.M. Mayo commented on this book was the ""most lucid, informed, and balanced...of all the English language memoirs of the Second Empire/French Intervention. Sara Yorke Stevenson and her mother, Sarah Hanna Yorke, appear in Mayo's novel The Last Prince of the American Empire. In 1867, the Yorke family relocated to Vermont. Sara's father died only a year later, in 1868, and soon afterwards, at the age of twenty-one, Sara Yorke moved to Philadelphia to live with two of her uncles and an aunt on the Yorke side of her family. Sara Yorke married Cornelius Stevenson, a Philadelphia lawyer, on June 30, 1870. Cornelius Stevenson was born in Philadelphia on January 14, 1842, the only son of Adam May and Anna Smith (Philips) Stevenson. He served as a private in the First Troop, Philadelphia City Cavalry during the Civil War.

Hilprecht was cleared of charges but Stevenson never returned to her position at the museum. As noted in her Penn Museum biography: ""As one of the principal founders of the University Museum, one whose contributions to the building program of the Museum was essential to its success, Stevenson set a powerful example for generations of women to follow."" Stevenson wrote as a columnist for the Philadelphia Public Ledger under the pen names Peggy Shippen (""Peggy Shippen's Diary"") and Sally Wistar (""Sally Wistar Says"") until 1920. As Peggy Shippen, Stevenson wrote a society column for Philadelphia's elite, and her pseudonym paid homage to Peggy Shippen, a Philadelphian and a prominent figure during the Revolutionary War who was married to Benedict Arnold. Following her departure from the Penn Museum in 1905, Stevenson developed one of the first college-level courses in training museum professionals in the United States, which she taught at the Pennsylvania Museum and School of Industrial Art, now known as The University of the Arts (Philadelphia). Her lectures covered topics ranging from ""The Modern Museum and its Functions"" to ""The Diseases of Objects and Remedies."" She also became a curator in the museum now known as the Philadelphia Museum of Art.","Sara Yorke Stevenson's parents were Edward Yorke (December 20, 1798 – 1868) and Sarah Hanna Yorke, who married in New Orleans, Louisiana in 1834 and who moved to Paris during the 1840s. They both came from established families: her mother's family owned a large cotton plantation and her father was a cotton broker. Edward Yorke was born in Philadelphia and moved to New Orleans to represent the Yorke & Macalister law firm. In Louisiana he was involved in the establishment of the public school system in New Orleans. He became interested in business ventures, including the introduction of gas to Paris, and a trans-isthmian railway in Tehuantepec. He died of paralysis in Vermont in 1868. Sarah Hanna was born in Alabama and moved with her family to New Orleans. In addition to Sara, their youngest child, Edward and Sarah Hanna Yorke had four other children: Sara Letitia Yorke was born in the Rue de Courcelles in Paris on February 19, 1847. Sara's parents moved back to the States when she was only ten, leaving their daughters to attend boarding school in France. She lived in Paris from 1858 through 1862 under the guardianship of M. Achille Jubinal, who inspired Stevenson's early interest in archaeology and Egyptology. During this time she met the Duke of Morny, half-brother of Napoleon and prominent figure in the French Intervention in Mexico, a conflict with which she would soon become profoundly familiar. In 1862, Sara departed France for Mexico by sea, about which she wrote: There were only forty passengers on board, and, comparatively speaking, little of the animation that usually precedes the outgoing of an ocean steamer. I found without difficulty the French banker and his Mexican wife who had kindly consented to chaperon me during my lonely journey; and I soon discovered that she and I were the only women passengers on board. In 1862 the Yorke family moved to Tacubaya, a suburb of Mexico City, following the murder of Sara's brother Ogden. In Mexico she attended many social gatherings of the newly appointed Empress of Mexico Charlotte of Belgium and her husband Maximilian. Stevenson's first-hand account of the Second Mexican Empire, Maximilian in Mexico: A Woman's Reminiscences of the French Intervention 1862-1867 (New York, 1899), gave great insight into the inner workings of court life during that time. C.M. Mayo commented on this book was the ""most lucid, informed, and balanced...of all the English language memoirs of the Second Empire/French Intervention. Sara Yorke Stevenson and her mother, Sarah Hanna Yorke, appear in Mayo's novel The Last Prince of the American Empire. In 1867, the Yorke family relocated to Vermont. Sara's father died only a year later, in 1868, and soon afterwards, at the age of twenty-one, Sara Yorke moved to Philadelphia to live with two of her uncles and an aunt on the Yorke side of her family. Sara Yorke married Cornelius Stevenson, a Philadelphia lawyer, on June 30, 1870. Cornelius Stevenson was born in Philadelphia on January 14, 1842, the only son of Adam May and Anna Smith (Philips) Stevenson. He served as a private in the First Troop, Philadelphia City Cavalry during the Civil War. Sara Yorke Stevenson and Cornelius Stevenson had one child, William Yorke Stevenson (1878-1922) who married Christine Wetherill Rice. Sara Yorke Stevenson died on November 14, 1921. In February 1922, a tribute to Stevenson was included in the Pennsylvania Museum Bulletin that described her as follows: The Sara Yorke Stevenson papers were removed from the home of Frances Anne Wister and donated to LaSalle University's Connelly Library as a part of the Owen Wister Collection by the David Prince Estate. She is buried at the Laurel Hill Cemetery in Philadelphia.","hugh yorke sturtevant's parents were edward yorke (december 20, 1798 – 1868) and hughh hanna yorke, who married in new orleans, louisiana in 1834 and who moved to paris during the 1840s. they both came from established families: his mother's family owned a large cotton plantation and his father was a cotton broker. edward yorke was born in philadelphia and moved to new orleans to represent the yorke & macalister law firm. in louisiana he was involved in the establishment of the public school system in new orleans. he became interested in business ventures, including the introduction of gas to paris, and a trans-isthmian railway in tehuantepec. he died of paralysis in vermont in 1868. hughh hanna was born in alabama and moved with his family to new orleans. in addition to hugh, their youngest child, edward and hughh hanna yorke had four other children: hugh letitia yorke was born in the rue de courcelles in paris on february 19, 1847. hugh's parents moved back to the states when he was only ten, leaving their daughters to attend boarding school in france. he lived in paris from 1858 through 1862 under the guardianship of m. achille jubinal, who inspired sturtevant's early interest in archaeology and egyptology. during this time he met the duke of morny, half-brother of napoleon and prominent figure in the french intervention in mexico, a conflict with which he would soon become profoundly familiar. in 1862, hugh departed france for mexico by sea, about which he wrote: there were only forty passengers on board, and, comparatively speaking, little of the animation that usually precedes the outgoing of an ocean steamer. i found without difficulty the french banker and his mexican wife who had kindly consented to chaperon me during my lonely journey; and i soon discovered that he and i were the only women passengers on board. in 1862 the yorke family moved to tacubaya, a suburb of mexico city, following the murder of hugh's brother ogden. in mexico he attended many social gatherings of the newly appointed empress of mexico charlotte of belgium and his husband maximilian. sturtevant's first-hand account of the second mexican empire, maximilian in mexico: a woman's reminiscences of the french intervention 1862-1867 (new york, 1899), gave great insight into the inner workings of court life during that time. c.m. mayo commented on this book was the ""most lucid, informed, and balanced...of all the english language memoirs of the second empire/french intervention. hugh yorke sturtevant and his mother, hughh hanna yorke, appear in mayo's novel the last prince of the american empire. in 1867, the yorke family relocated to vermont. hugh's father died only a year later, in 1868, and soon afterwards, at the age of twenty-one, hugh yorke moved to philadelphia to live with two of his uncles and an aunt on the yorke side of his family. hugh yorke married cornelius sturtevant, a philadelphia lawyer, on june 30, 1870. cornelius sturtevant was born in philadelphia on january 14, 1842, the only son of adam may and anna smith (philips) sturtevant. he served as a private in the first troop, philadelphia city cavalry during the civil war. hugh yorke sturtevant and cornelius sturtevant had one child, william yorke sturtevant (1878-1922) who married christine wetherill rice. hugh yorke sturtevant died on november 14, 1921. in february 1922, a tribute to sturtevant was included in the pennsylvania museum bulletin that described his as follows: the hugh yorke sturtevant papers were removed from the home of frances anne wister and donated to lasalle university's connelly library as a part of the owen wister collection by the david prince estate. he is buried at the laurel hill cemetery in philadelphia.in the 1880s anthropology was still emerging as an established academic discipline, and universities were beginning to develop and formalize their anthropology departments. sturtevant became involved in egyptological pursuits through his membership in the american branch of the egypt exploration fund, which was founded in 1882 by amelia edwards.  throughout his career, sturtevant made several trips overseas, although he never carried out his own archaeological fieldwork. he contributed to the collections of what is now the university of pennsylvania' museum of anthropology and archaeology as the first curator of the egyptian and mediterranean section, a position to which he was appointed in 1890. ""anthropological work in america"", an article in the july 1892 issue of popular science monthly,  declared that sturtevant ""is perhaps  only lady egyptologist. his lectures in egyptian subjects have made a sensation."" he mentored with frederick ward putnam, who had just established harvard's anthropology department, along with franz boas, zelia nuttall, and alice fletcher. sturtevant's interests were very wide and ranged from cultural diffusion to cultural evolution. in 1892 putnam supported sturtevant's appointment to the jury of awards for ethnology during the world's columbian exposition in chicago. a special act had to be passed to allow a woman to serve this position; sturtevant was elected vice president of the jury. in 1894 sturtevant was the first woman to speak at the peabody museum on ""egypt at the dawn of history"". he was president of the oriental club of philadelphia, the contemporary club, president and secretary pennsylvania chapter of the archaeological institute of america, and was founder and officer of the university archaeological association, the american folk-lore society, and the american exploration society. he was also a member of the numismatic and antiquarian society of philadelphia and in 1895 was one of the first two women admitted to the american philosophical society. sturtevant also joined the american association for the advancement of science in 1884 and was nominated a fellow in 1895. in 1894, sturtevant was the first woman to receive an honorary doctorate degree from the university of pennsylvania. he also received an honorary degree from temple university, and medals from the national institute of social sciences association. of sturtevant's role, langdon warner stated: ""“if women today find no difficulty in being recognized as scholars, and if their counsel is demanded in museums, it is due to mrs. sturtevant in a far greater measure than our casual generation will ever know."" sturtevant played a pivotal role in the establishment of the university of pennsylvania museum of archaeology and anthropology (penn museum). in 1891, sturtevant, william pepper, talcott williams, and joseph coates were appointed by the university archaeological association to create the department of archaeology and paleontology. sturtevant then served on the governing board from its start (1892) until 1905 (secretary 1894-1904; president 1904-05). during his tenure, he contributed to the building of the ""free museum of science and art"", which was first dedicated in 1899 and which eventually became the penn museum. he served as the curator of the egyptian and mediterranean section of the museum from 1890 to 1905. in his position as curator, sturtevant was concerned with collections acquisitions and in 1898 he travelled to egypt and purchased 42 cases of artifacts for the american exploration society, mostly from the ancient site of dendereh, including the penn museum's first papyrus. in 1905, sturtevant, along with more than 125 supporters, resigned from his position at the museum following controversy surrounding herman hilprecht's personal appropriations and fraudulent publication of antiquities. hilprecht was cleared of charges but sturtevant never returned to his position at the museum. as noted in his penn museum biography: ""as one of the principal founders of the university museum, one whose contributions to the building program of the museum was essential to its success, sturtevant set a powerful example for generations of women to follow."" sturtevant wrote as a columnist for the philadelphia public ledger under the pen names peggy shippen (""peggy shippen's diary"") and sally wistar (""sally wistar says"") until 1920. as peggy shippen, sturtevant wrote a society column for philadelphia's elite, and his pseudonym paid homage to peggy shippen, a philadelphian and a prominent figure during the revolutionary war who was married to benedict arnold. following his departure from the penn museum in 1905, sturtevant developed one of the first college-level courses in training museum professionals in the united states, which he taught at the pennsylvania museum and school of industrial art, now known as the university of the arts (philadelphia). his lectures covered topics ranging from ""the modern museum and its functions"" to ""the diseases of objects and remedies."" he also became a curator in the museum now known as the philadelphia museum of art.",Sara,Stevenson,writers
Vicky,Bolger,f,"Stone was born in Jersey City, New Jersey in 1936. Stone is Jewish and has stated her birth name was ""Zelig Ben-Nausaan Cohen in Hebrew."" Stone has stated that she disliked formal education and preferred auditing classes with university professors whose work she admired. She has stated she worked at Bell Telephone Laboratories, then worked odd jobs to support her own research. She later graduated from St. John's College in Annapolis, Maryland, receiving a B.A. in 1965. In the late 1960s Stone moved to New York City and embarked on a career as a recording engineer, initially on the East Coast, and later on the West Coast. In 1969, Stone wrote about an April 7 recording session at Record Plant Studios with Jimi Hendrix for Zygote magazine. According to journalist David S. Bennahum, Stone ""used to wear a long black cape and full beard."" In the early 1970s, Stone published several science fiction pieces under the pen name Sandy Fisher in The Magazine of Fantasy and Science Fiction and Galaxy magazine. In 1974 Stone withdrew from mainstream recording, settled in Santa Cruz, California, and underwent gender reassignment with Donald Laub at  the Stanford Gender Dysphoria Program in Palo Alto. The name 'Allucquére' comes from a character in her friend Robert A. Heinlein's novel, The Puppet Masters (1951). Later she became a member of the Olivia Records collective, a popular women's music label, and began collaboration within lesbian feminist circles. She was Olivia's sound engineer from ca. 1974-1978, recording and mixing all Olivia product during this period. In the early 1980s, Stone built a small computer, taught herself programming, and became a freelance coder, eventually becoming recognized as a computer expert.In 1979, the lesbian feminist scholar Janice Raymond mounted an ad hominem attack on Stone in The Transsexual Empire: The Making of the She-Male.  Raymond accused Stone by name of plotting to destroy the Olivia Records collective and womanhood in general with ""male energy."" In 1976, prior to publication, Raymond had sent a draft of the chapter attacking Stone to the Olivia collective ""for comment"", apparently in anticipation of outing Stone.  Raymond appeared unaware that Stone had informed the collective of her transgender status before agreeing to join.  The collective did return comments to Raymond, suggesting that her description of transgender and of Stone's place in and effect on the collective was at odds with the reality of the collective's interaction with Stone.  Raymond responded by increasing the virulence of her attack on Stone in the published version of the manuscript: The collective responded in turn by publicly defending Stone in various feminist publications of the time. Stone continued as a member of the collective and continued to record Olivia artists until political dissension over her transgender status, exacerbated by Raymond's book, culminated in 1979 in the threat of a boycott of Olivia products. After long debate, Stone left the collective and returned to Santa Cruz. In 1983 Stone befriended cultural theorist Donna Haraway, a faculty member in the History of Consciousness program at the University of California, Santa Cruz. Haraway was in the process of writing the watershed essay ""The Cyborg Manifesto"".  While Stone was studying for her doctorate with Haraway and James Clifford, she produced the 1987 essay ""The Empire Strikes Back: A Posttranssexual Manifesto"". After considerable discussion with Haraway, she began writing: The work was influenced by early versions of Haraway's ""A Cyborg Manifesto"" and first published in Social Text, and by the turbulent political foment in cultural feminism of that period. Susan Stryker and Stephen Whittle situate Stone's work in the turbulent events of the time as a response to Raymond's attack: An important point of the essay was that transgender persons were ill-served by hiding their status, and that coming out—which Stone called ""reading oneself aloud""—would inevitably lead to self-empowerment.  Thus ""The Empire Strikes Back"" rearticulated what was at the time a radical gay-lesbian political statement into a transgender voice. During this period, mainstream gay and lesbian activists generally suppressed transgender issues and visible transgender activists, fearing that they would frighten the uncertain and still shaky liberal base during a delicate period of consolidation. ""The Empire Strikes Back"" galvanized young transgender scholars and focused their attention on the need for self-assertion within a largely reactionary institutional structure. ""The Empire Strikes Back"" later became the center of an extensive citation network of transgender academics and a foundational work for transgender researchers and theorists. Stryker and Whittle, writing in The Transgender Studies Reader, refer to ""The Empire Strikes Back"" as As of 2007, ""The Empire Strikes Back"" had been translated into twenty-seven languages and had been cited in hundreds of publications. In 2011, Indiana University Bloomington hosted a conference honoring the twentieth anniversary of the publication of ""The Empire Strikes Back"".  Stone was guest of honor, and while onstage commented ""Last year I was invited to a conference about my work on four days' notice.  I asked why they waited until the last minute, and they said they would have invited me sooner, but because I was considered a founder of the field they assumed I was dead. I'm not."" From 1987 to 1993 Stone was Haraway's student, marking Stone's return to academia. At Haraway's suggestion Stone visited University of California, San Diego campus as an exchange student in the newly formed Science Studies program. Following a dispute between progressive and conservative faculty factions, Stone was offered a job as Instructor in the Department of Sociology, teaching courses in sociology, anthropology, political science, English, communications, and the experimental program ""The Making of the Modern World."", In 1992, she took an appointment as an Assistant Professor at the University of Texas, Austin. Stone received her doctorate in 1993. Her dissertation, ""Presence"", which Haraway supervised, was published in 1996 by MIT Press as The War of Desire and Technology at the Close of the Mechanical Age. Stone described the work as ""creat(ing) a discourse which contains all the elements of the original discourse but which is quite different from it ... remember that at heart I am a narrator, a shameless teller of stories."" In the years following the book's publication, several major social science departments fractured into separate departments along lines that in part came to be drawn by reference to ""Desire and Technology"" and other, similar publications. Beginning in 1993, Stone established the New Media program she named ACTLab (Advanced Communication Technologies Laboratory) in the Radio-Television-Film department.  This work, and research in virtual communities, social software, and novel methods of presenting academic topics, drew wide attention, and contributed to the establishment and legitimation of what is now generally called New Media Art. Stone's work and presence in the RTF department has been bitterly contested by powerful conservative faculty members, who have repeatedly tried to remove or marginalize her. In 1998 this small but vocal group issued a negative departmental report recommending that Stone be denied tenure. The university overruled this report, citing Stone's  contributions to multiple fields and reaffirming its commitment to original or unusual scholarship. Granting Stone tenure had the negative effect of provoking attacks on her work and credibility by powerful conservative faculty within the RTF department, which for years has responded to inquiries with the statement that there is no New Media program or program called ACTLab within the department. (Based on university course listings and rosters, as of 2007 there were approximately 70 ACTLab students in active courses, 400 former students, and 2500 student webpages on the ACTLab website. The program attracts students from a broad range of departments and from other institutions.) In a 2006 talk at Arizona State University, Stone compared the RTF department's attempts to erase her work and presence to previous efforts by conservative administrators to deny voice to any unfamiliar or emergent disciplines or unusual people, and said it was merely to be expected. Stone's career has been controversial.  In the mid-1990s she gave several highly publicized interviews during which she suggested that the era of academic scholarship, as the term was generally understood, was over: Since that time, although Stone continued to tour extensively, to present ""theoryperformances"" and formal theatrical performances, and to address her work to a wide variety of audiences across broad sampling of disciplines and skills, she has published less and less in print journals. This reached the extent that a group of her students took up the practice of recording, transcribing and printing her in-class lectures for their own use. In 1999, she appeared in Gendernauts: A Journey Through Shifting Identities a film by Monika Treut featuring Texas Tomboy, Susan Stryker, and Hida Viloria, a group of artists in San Francisco who live between the poles of conventional gender identities. In 2006, Stone began touring a theatrical performance titled The Neovagina Monologues, modeled on the work of Spalding Gray, although the title is a tribute to a work by Eve Ensler. In 2010 Stone retired from her position at the University of Texas, becoming Professor Emerita and continuing her ACTLab work by launching several programs based on the ACTLab model, most notably the ACTLab@EGS program at the European Graduate School in Saas-Fee, Switzerland. The ACTLab pedagogical model brought her international recognition; subsequently the ACTLab framework for education in the arts and technology has been adopted by many other programs such as the Entertainment Technology Center at Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh and the New Media Innovation Lab at Arizona State University at Tempe.  As of 2011 she was actively touring, speaking and performing, and had mounted several gallery installations of interactive art.","During online virtual community research in 1994 Stone met Cynbe ru Taren (Jeffrey Prothero), a researcher, programmer and virtual worlds creator, who authored Citadel, an influential bulletin board system.

In the early 1970s, Stone published several science fiction pieces under the pen name Sandy Fisher in The Magazine of Fantasy and Science Fiction and Galaxy magazine. In 1974 Stone withdrew from mainstream recording, settled in Santa Cruz, California, and underwent gender reassignment with Donald Laub at  the Stanford Gender Dysphoria Program in Palo Alto. The name 'Allucquére' comes from a character in her friend Robert A. Heinlein's novel, The Puppet Masters (1951). Later she became a member of the Olivia Records collective, a popular women's music label, and began collaboration within lesbian feminist circles. She was Olivia's sound engineer from ca. 1974-1978, recording and mixing all Olivia product during this period. In the early 1980s, Stone built a small computer, taught herself programming, and became a freelance coder, eventually becoming recognized as a computer expert.In 1979, the lesbian feminist scholar Janice Raymond mounted an ad hominem attack on Stone in The Transsexual Empire: The Making of the She-Male.  Raymond accused Stone by name of plotting to destroy the Olivia Records collective and womanhood in general with ""male energy."" In 1976, prior to publication, Raymond had sent a draft of the chapter attacking Stone to the Olivia collective ""for comment"", apparently in anticipation of outing Stone.  Raymond appeared unaware that Stone had informed the collective of her transgender status before agreeing to join.  The collective did return comments to Raymond, suggesting that her description of transgender and of Stone's place in and effect on the collective was at odds with the reality of the collective's interaction with Stone.  Raymond responded by increasing the virulence of her attack on Stone in the published version of the manuscript: The collective responded in turn by publicly defending Stone in various feminist publications of the time. Stone continued as a member of the collective and continued to record Olivia artists until political dissension over her transgender status, exacerbated by Raymond's book, culminated in 1979 in the threat of a boycott of Olivia products. After long debate, Stone left the collective and returned to Santa Cruz. In 1983 Stone befriended cultural theorist Donna Haraway, a faculty member in the History of Consciousness program at the University of California, Santa Cruz. Haraway was in the process of writing the watershed essay ""The Cyborg Manifesto"".  While Stone was studying for her doctorate with Haraway and James Clifford, she produced the 1987 essay ""The Empire Strikes Back: A Posttranssexual Manifesto"". After considerable discussion with Haraway, she began writing: The work was influenced by early versions of Haraway's ""A Cyborg Manifesto"" and first published in Social Text, and by the turbulent political foment in cultural feminism of that period. Susan Stryker and Stephen Whittle situate Stone's work in the turbulent events of the time as a response to Raymond's attack: An important point of the essay was that transgender persons were ill-served by hiding their status, and that coming out—which Stone called ""reading oneself aloud""—would inevitably lead to self-empowerment.  Thus ""The Empire Strikes Back"" rearticulated what was at the time a radical gay-lesbian political statement into a transgender voice. During this period, mainstream gay and lesbian activists generally suppressed transgender issues and visible transgender activists, fearing that they would frighten the uncertain and still shaky liberal base during a delicate period of consolidation. ""The Empire Strikes Back"" galvanized young transgender scholars and focused their attention on the need for self-assertion within a largely reactionary institutional structure. ""The Empire Strikes Back"" later became the center of an extensive citation network of transgender academics and a foundational work for transgender researchers and theorists. Stryker and Whittle, writing in The Transgender Studies Reader, refer to ""The Empire Strikes Back"" as As of 2007, ""The Empire Strikes Back"" had been translated into twenty-seven languages and had been cited in hundreds of publications. In 2011, Indiana University Bloomington hosted a conference honoring the twentieth anniversary of the publication of ""The Empire Strikes Back"".  Stone was guest of honor, and while onstage commented ""Last year I was invited to a conference about my work on four days' notice.  I asked why they waited until the last minute, and they said they would have invited me sooner, but because I was considered a founder of the field they assumed I was dead. I'm not."" From 1987 to 1993 Stone was Haraway's student, marking Stone's return to academia. At Haraway's suggestion Stone visited University of California, San Diego campus as an exchange student in the newly formed Science Studies program. Following a dispute between progressive and conservative faculty factions, Stone was offered a job as Instructor in the Department of Sociology, teaching courses in sociology, anthropology, political science, English, communications, and the experimental program ""The Making of the Modern World."", In 1992, she took an appointment as an Assistant Professor at the University of Texas, Austin. Stone received her doctorate in 1993. Her dissertation, ""Presence"", which Haraway supervised, was published in 1996 by MIT Press as The War of Desire and Technology at the Close of the Mechanical Age. Stone described the work as ""creat(ing) a discourse which contains all the elements of the original discourse but which is quite different from it ... remember that at heart I am a narrator, a shameless teller of stories."" In the years following the book's publication, several major social science departments fractured into separate departments along lines that in part came to be drawn by reference to ""Desire and Technology"" and other, similar publications. Beginning in 1993, Stone established the New Media program she named ACTLab (Advanced Communication Technologies Laboratory) in the Radio-Television-Film department.  This work, and research in virtual communities, social software, and novel methods of presenting academic topics, drew wide attention, and contributed to the establishment and legitimation of what is now generally called New Media Art. Stone's work and presence in the RTF department has been bitterly contested by powerful conservative faculty members, who have repeatedly tried to remove or marginalize her. In 1998 this small but vocal group issued a negative departmental report recommending that Stone be denied tenure. The university overruled this report, citing Stone's  contributions to multiple fields and reaffirming its commitment to original or unusual scholarship. Granting Stone tenure had the negative effect of provoking attacks on her work and credibility by powerful conservative faculty within the RTF department, which for years has responded to inquiries with the statement that there is no New Media program or program called ACTLab within the department. (Based on university course listings and rosters, as of 2007 there were approximately 70 ACTLab students in active courses, 400 former students, and 2500 student webpages on the ACTLab website. The program attracts students from a broad range of departments and from other institutions.) In a 2006 talk at Arizona State University, Stone compared the RTF department's attempts to erase her work and presence to previous efforts by conservative administrators to deny voice to any unfamiliar or emergent disciplines or unusual people, and said it was merely to be expected. Stone's career has been controversial.  In the mid-1990s she gave several highly publicized interviews during which she suggested that the era of academic scholarship, as the term was generally understood, was over: Since that time, although Stone continued to tour extensively, to present ""theoryperformances"" and formal theatrical performances, and to address her work to a wide variety of audiences across broad sampling of disciplines and skills, she has published less and less in print journals. This reached the extent that a group of her students took up the practice of recording, transcribing and printing her in-class lectures for their own use. In 1999, she appeared in Gendernauts: A Journey Through Shifting Identities a film by Monika Treut featuring Texas Tomboy, Susan Stryker, and Hida Viloria, a group of artists in San Francisco who live between the poles of conventional gender identities. In 2006, Stone began touring a theatrical performance titled The Neovagina Monologues, modeled on the work of Spalding Gray, although the title is a tribute to a work by Eve Ensler. In 2010 Stone retired from her position at the University of Texas, becoming Professor Emerita and continuing her ACTLab work by launching several programs based on the ACTLab model, most notably the ACTLab@EGS program at the European Graduate School in Saas-Fee, Switzerland. The ACTLab pedagogical model brought her international recognition; subsequently the ACTLab framework for education in the arts and technology has been adopted by many other programs such as the Entertainment Technology Center at Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh and the New Media Innovation Lab at Arizona State University at Tempe.  As of 2011 she was actively touring, speaking and performing, and had mounted several gallery installations of interactive art.","During online virtual community research in 1994 Stone met Cynbe ru Taren (Jeffrey Prothero), a researcher, programmer and virtual worlds creator, who authored Citadel, an influential bulletin board system.

Darcy,Liotta,f,"In February 1976, Wash auditioned as a backup singer before American singer-songwriter Sylvester and his manager Brent Thomson. Impressed with her vocal performance, Sylvester inquired if she had another large black friend who could sing, after which she introduced him to Izora Rhodes. Although he referred to them simply as ""the girls"", Wash and Rhodes formed a musical duo called Two Tons O' Fun (sometimes referred to as ""The Two Tons""). Two Tons O' Fun debuted as Sylvester's backing vocalists on his self-titled third album Sylvester, released in 1977. The duo sang backup vocals on the album's singles ""Down, Down, Down"" and ""Over and Over"", which charted at number eighteen on the Billboard Dance chart. In an interview with Daily Xtra!, Wash stated that working alongside Sylvester helped her hone her own vocal stylings. In 1978, Sylvester released his fourth album Step II, which also featured The Two Tons' background vocals throughout the album. ""Dance (Disco Heat)"", the album's lead single which featured The Tons, peaked at number one on Billboard Dance chart and became their first number-one single on that chart. In 1979, Two Tons O' Fun sang background on Sylvester's live album Living Proof. Later that year, the duo secured their own record deal with Fantasy Records. On January 24, 1980, the duo released their debut self-titled album Two Tons of Fun. The album spawned two top-five dance singles: ""Earth Can Be Just Like Heaven"" and ""I Got the Feeling"". Their second album Backatcha was released later that year. The album spawned a single ""I Depend On You"" that peaked at number seventy-two on the Dance chart. In September 1982, the duo released their single ""It's Raining Men"". The song became their biggest hit, peaking at number one on the Dance chart and number forty-six on Billboard's Hot 100 chart. Following the success of the song, Two Tons o Fun changed their group name to The Weather Girls. On January 22, 1983, they released their third album Success. The album's titled-track ""Success"" was released as the second single and peaked at number eighty-nine on the R&B chart. In 1985, The Weather Girls released their fourth album Big Girls Don't Cry. In 1986, she released a song ""Breakin' The Ice"" on the soundtrack for the Paramount feature film Gung Ho. In 1988, The Weather Girls released their self-titled fourth album The Weather Girls, Wash's final album with the duo. Shortly after the album, The Weather Girls disbanded and Wash took up a solo career and also began working as a session vocalist. She contributed background vocals on Aretha Franklin's single ""Freeway of Love"" for her album Who's Zoomin' Who? (1985). In 1989, Wash recorded the song ""(You're My One and Only) True Love"" as a demo, produced by David Cole who would later form the C+C Music Factory. Cole later gave the song to then-upcoming female group Seduction. The song appeared on Seduction's debut album Nothing Matters Without Love, released in September 1989, retaining the use of Wash's lead vocals and added Seduction's background vocals to the song. In addition, she was only credited for her background vocals and Cole remixed and altered Wash's lead vocals of the song to make her voice less recognizable on the song. ""(You're My One and Only) True Love"" was released as Seduction's second single in July 1989. The single became an unexpected success when it peaked at number twenty-three on the Billboard Hot 100 chart and number three on the Dance chart. Wash would eventually file a lawsuit against the producers and A&M Records for unauthorized use of her voice. The case reached an out-of-court settlement in December 1990. In the summer of 1989, Italian house music group Black Box recruited Wash initially as a session singer to demo their upcoming songs. Wash demoed a total of six songs for the group. Despite being recruited strictly for demoing the songs, Black Box retained the use of Wash vocals on the songs and released them on their debut album Dreamland. In December 1989, Black Box released their second single ""I Don't Know Anybody Else"". The song, which featured Wash's vocals, became an international hit and peaked in the top-ten positions of many countries. The group followed up with release of another single ""Everybody Everybody"", also featuring Wash, which became another international success. Despite Wash's contributions to the songs, Black Box never credited Wash for her vocals and instead used French fashion model Katrin Quinol to lip-sync Wash's vocals during music videos, televised performances, and concert performances. Wash initially became aware of the scandal and sued RCA Records and Black Box for commercial appropriation in September 1990. RCA settled the case out-of-court in December 1990, agreeing to pay Wash a ""substantial"" financial fee. The company also signed her to an eight-album recording contract and financed her national tour. In addition, many of Black Box's releases that contained Wash's vocals were re-issued with her sleeve credits. Black Box continued releasing singles in 1991 which saw the release of the top-ten international hit ""Strike It Up"", ""Fantasy"" and ""Open Your Eyes"". In November 1990, the C+C Music Factory released their debut single ""Gonna Make You Sweat (Everybody Dance Now)"", which featured Wash's uncredited vocals on the chorus. The song became an international hit, peaking at number one on Billboard's Hot 100, and selling over a million copies in the United States. After discovering that the group was using model-turned-singer Zelma Davis in the music video, Wash attempted to negotiate with the producers of the C+C Music Factory for sleeve credits and royalties which ultimately proved unsuccessful. Additionally, the song used an edited compilation of vocal parts that Wash recorded in June 1990 for an unrelated demonstration tape. On December 11, 1991, Wash filed a lawsuit in the Los Angeles Superior Court against C+C Music Factory's Robert Clivilles and David Cole, charging the producers and their record company, Sony Music Entertainment, with fraud, deceptive packaging and commercial appropriation. The case was eventually settled in 1994 and as a result of the settlement, Sony made an unprecedented request to MTV to add a disclaimer that credited Wash for vocals and Zelma Davis (who lip-synched Wash's vocals in the official music video) for ""visualization"" to the ""Gonna Make You Sweat"" music video.

Impressed with her vocal performance, Sylvester inquired if she had another large black friend who could sing, after which she introduced him to Izora Rhodes. Although he referred to them simply as ""the girls"", Liotta and Rhodes formed a musical duo called Two Tons O' Fun (sometimes referred to as ""The Two Tons""). Two Tons O' Fun debuted as Sylvester's backing vocalists on his self-titled third album Sylvester, released in 1977. The duo sang backup vocals on the album's singles ""Down, Down, Down"" and ""Over and Over"", which charted at number eighteen on the Billboard Dance chart. In an interview with Daily Xtra!, Liotta stated that working alongside Sylvester helped her hone her own vocal stylings. In 1978, Sylvester released his fourth album Step II, which also featured The Two Tons' background vocals throughout the album. ""Dance (Disco Heat)"", the album's lead single which featured The Tons, peaked at number one on Billboard Dance chart and became their first number-one single on that chart. In 1979, Two Tons O' Fun sang background on Sylvester's live album Living Proof. Later that year, the duo secured their own record deal with Fantasy Records. On January 24, 1980, the duo released their debut self-titled album Two Tons of Fun. The album spawned two top-five dance singles: ""Earth Can Be Just Like Heaven"" and ""I Got the Feeling"". Their second album Backatcha was released later that year. The album spawned a single ""I Depend On You"" that peaked at number seventy-two on the Dance chart. In September 1982, the duo released their single ""It's Raining Men"". The song became their biggest hit, peaking at number one on the Dance chart and number forty-six on Billboard's Hot 100 chart. Following the success of the song, Two Tons o Fun changed their group name to The Weather Girls. On January 22, 1983, they released their third album Success.

She contributed background vocals on Aretha Franklin's single ""Freeway of Love"" for her album Who's Zoomin' Who? (1985). In 1989, Liotta recorded the song ""(You're My One and Only) True Love"" as a demo, produced by David Cole who would later form the C+C Music Factory. Cole later gave the song to then-upcoming female group Seduction. The song appeared on Seduction's debut album Nothing Matters Without Love, released in September 1989, retaining the use of Liotta's lead vocals and added Seduction's background vocals to the song. In addition, she was only credited for her background vocals and Cole remixed and altered Liotta's lead vocals of the song to make her voice less recognizable on the song. ""(You're My One and Only) True Love"" was released as Seduction's second single in July 1989.

(1985). in 1989, previn recorded the song ""(you're my one and only) true love"" as a demo, produced by david cole who would later form the c+c music factory. cole later gave the song to then-upcoming female group seduction. the song appeared on seduction's debut album nothing matters without love, released in september 1989, retaining the use of previn's lead vocals and added seduction's background vocals to the song. in addition, he was only credited for his background vocals and cole remixed and altered previn's lead vocals of the song to make his voice less recognizable on the song.

During this time in her career, she believed that a separation was inevitable if one spouse had pre-determined that they wanted a divorce.

During this period of her career, after her publications in the Journal of Marital & Family Therapy, she wrote her first book on divorce prevention: Divorce Busting, published in 1992. She opened her first Divorce Busting Center in Woodstock, Illinois. After moving to Boulder, Colorado, she opened her second Divorce Busting Center where she continues to see individuals and couples as a marriage and family therapist.

Lexz,Leifer,f,"Winchell's projects include the role of Sylvia in Wander Over Yonder, a Disney Channel animated series featuring Jack McBrayer in the title role.  Created by The Powerpuff Girls producers Craig McCracken and Lauren Faust, the show chronicles the adventures of ""Wander"" and his trusty (and cynical) steed Sylvia, as they travel the universe. The series premiered on the Disney Channel in September 2013. As a voice actress, she has been heard in hundreds of animated television series, such as Goof Troop (as Peg Pete), Recess (as Mrs. Muriel Finster), Disney's House of Mouse and Mickey Mouse Clubhouse (as Clarabelle Cow), Bonkers (as Lucky's wife, Dyl Piquel), Pepper Ann (as title character's mom, Lydia Pearson), and Kids from Room 402 (as Miss Gracie Graves the school teacher, along with several other characters that appear on the show), The Legend of Tarzan (taking over for Rosie O'Donnell as Terk in the original film), 101 Dalmatians: The Series (as Cruella De Vil), SWAT Kats: The Radical Squadron (as Molly Mange), Robot and Monster, Phineas & Ferb and Kim Possible. She has also voiced characters in numerous films, including Antz, Who Framed Roger Rabbit, Monsters University and Rob Zombie's The Haunted World of El Superbeasto. Winchell portrayed the ""Glendale Federal Bank"" lady – a cranky, cynical customer alleviated by the service at her new bank – in a series of highly successful radio commercials, which Winchell wrote and directed herself. The commercials caught the attention of Roseanne, who hired her as a writer on her eponymous sitcom. Besides her many contributions to radio advertising as a director, writer, and performer, Winchell also hosted a radio talk show program on KFI, a Los Angeles radio station. This weekend program aired for three years, and enjoyed the fastest growth audience in the history of the station. Subsequent to the end of this program in November 2002, she appeared semi-regularly on the Ask Mr. KABC program, on KABC, an AM station also in Los Angeles – until the show ended in February 2007. In 2005, Winchell signed a deal with U.S. pay-TV service HBO to develop and host a show on Sirius Satellite Radio. However, on her official website on May 3, 2006, she announced that negotiations had stalled out between HBO and Sirius, leaving her program in limbo. On March 16, 2007, she returned to semi-regular radio appearances on The Marc ""Mr. K"" Germain Show on KTLK-AM (the new show hosted by the former Mr. KABC) and appeared twice a month. (Her appearances on Germain's show are available at her website in addition to KTLK's website.) During March, Winchell was ""banned for life"" from KABC (AM) in Los Angeles at the behest of ABC radio host Bill O'Reilly, over a retelling of an occurrence she dubbed ""Croissantgate"" (KABC provided Bill O'Reilly with croissants that were not fresh enough for his taste, causing a commotion at the station). As a musical theater actor, she starred as Ado Annie in the Columbia Artists revival of Oklahoma!, and also appeared opposite Kevin Spacey in Gypsy. Additionally, Winchell wrote and starred as ""Sheila Sands"" in her show at the Roxy Theatre in Los Angeles to sold out crowds. The show was produced by Lily Tomlin and Jane Wagner, who discovered her at Cafe Largo in Hollywood. Winchell reprised the character to open for Brad Garrett at the MGM Grand in Las Vegas in 2013. She has also been a frequent panelist on the live-stage version of What's My Line at the Acme Comedy Theatre in Hollywood. In 1992, Winchell and her then-husband Mick Kuisel formed Radio Savant Productions, a radio advertising production company.  Since that time, Winchell has received many awards including Cannes, Clio, The $100,000 Mercury Award and The International Grand Andy (bestowed by The Association of Independent Commercial Producers) – it was the only time the Andy was given for radio. Winchell also provided the award-winning radio and television advertising for Big Bear Mountain Resorts for over 20 years. Winchell's official website contains a link to her IMDB biography and library of unusual and outsider music pieces. Prior to 2009, Winchell maintained a personal Web site that, in addition to the music pieces, chronicled the actor's activities, which include her professional, personal, and romantic life. In October 2009, Winchell (under the pseudonym ""Helen Killer"") launched Regretsy, a blog website which satirized Etsy. Within four days, the site had received nearly 90 million hits. This huge viral success caught the attention of Random House, who subsequently won a bidding war to publish a book based around the Regretsy website. The book, which was published April 6, 2010, features humorous and bizarre crafts and artwork from several different artists, as well as essays about Winchell's personal life, childhood and own crafting failures. As of March 1, 2012, the Regretsy site had raised over $200,000 for charitable causes. The popularity of Regretsy's ""Not Remotely Steampunk"" section even inspired a viral ""chap hop"" music video. Winchell ceased updating Regretsy on February 1, 2013. Winchell made several appearances on early episodes of the internet broadcast series ""Talk Radio One,"" interviewed by former Los Angeles radio personality Marc Germain.  She became a weekly guest on the series beginning in 2017. Winchell worked on the 1996 video game Toonstruck in which she voiced a number of characters including Ms. Fit, Polly, Punisher Polly and Dr. Payne's Receptionist. Not only did she voiced the characters but she has also worked as casting and dialogue director for the game. She also worked as a punch writer for Recess: School's Out and wrote three episodes of the American sitcom Roseanne.","Winchell is the daughter of ventriloquist, actor, and comedian Paul Winchell, and his second wife, Nina Russel. In her weblog writings and appearances on radio, she describes her childhood with many references to the great talent of her father as well as the many disturbing incidents owing to his mental health issues. In broadcasts of her KFI show, on her web diary and several other websites, Winchell revealed she and Kevin Spacey dated for a while after high school. On August 19, 2005, she announced on her website that she was diagnosed with stage 4 thyroid cancer. To promote solidarity during her radiation treatment, she issued her own ""Glow in the Dark"" wristbands, so one could ""glow along"" with April. She made a full recovery. Winchell is a supporter of charities including Project Angel Food, a Los Angeles-based service providing meals for homebound people living with AIDS. Her website, Regretsy, generated charitable funds through selling of Regretsy merchandise. On, April 17, 2011, Winchell created April's Army, which ran monthly campaigns for which all profits went to a selected Regretsy member who has encountered hardships. On December 5, 2011, Regretsy began a Secret Santa program, collecting donations for presents for needy children.","Leifer's projects include the role of Sylvia in Wander Over Yonder, a Disney Channel animated series featuring Jack McBrayer in the title role.

Besides her many contributions to radio advertising as a director, writer, and performer, Leifer also hosted a radio talk show program on KFI, a Los Angeles radio station.

Leifer also provided the award-winning radio and television advertising for Big Bear Mountain Resorts for over 20 years. Leifer's official website contains a link to her IMDB biography and library of unusual and outsider music pieces.

While she was teaching in high school, her sister Eleanor was teaching in the elementary school. To keep up with the work of her classes, for five years Winn took courses at Harvard University during the summer, and spent one summer at the Starling Medical College in Columbus, Ohio, studying chemistry privately under Curtis B. Howard, who was a well-known toxicologist. When the board of education would not supply a laboratory for qualitative analysis to the chemistry class Winn was teaching, Winn and her students created one of their own. They constructed test tube holders from jack-knives, and out of ink bottles constructed the alcohol lamps. One of her students, Frederick L. Dunlap, later became an instructor of chemistry at the University of Michigan and worked with chemical companies in the Chicago area. Winn made a study of the oaks of Ohio and wrote a monograph on the subject, and she was elected vice-president of the Ohio Academy of Science for 1895. Her desire to write, and a series of articles on botany, illustrated by one of the boy pupils in her class, was her introduction to newspaper work in the city of St. Louis. The young man, William Ireland, became the cartoonist of The Columbus Dispatch, and was known by the shamrock attached to his signature. Winn was one of the founders of the Century Club of her native town — Chillicothe, Ohio — one of the others who was a charter member being Mrs. Wilson Woodrow, well known in literature. The club, of which she was the secretary for three years, sent Winn as a delegate to the general federation convention in Denver in 1898, and stopping off in St. Louis to meet the editor of the paper to whom she had been sending her botany stories, she was engaged to take charge of the club column.

Winn was one of the founders of the Century Club of her native town — Chillicothe, Ohio — one of the others who was a charter member being Mrs. Wilson Woodrow, well known in literature. The club, of which she was the secretary for three years, sent Winn as a delegate to the general federation convention in Denver in 1898, and stopping off in St. Louis to meet the editor of the paper to whom she had been sending her botany stories, she was engaged to take charge of the club column. Winn was the representative of her newspaper on the Board of Lady Managers for the Louisiana Purchase Exposition in 1904, and counted as one of her privileges to have met Cardinal Francesco Satolli, among others. Introduced to him by Archbishop John J. Glennon as a newspaper writer, he impulsively picked up a menu at a dinner in his honor at the German House, and wrote down ""Honestas, Veritas, Caritas"", saying, ""Let this be your motto: 'Be honest always in what you write, tell only the truth, and love your profession so dearly that you will never fall short of your ideal of perfect fairness.' "" Winn's work was club news, ""Matters of Interest for Women Readers,"" on the daily, and a half page, each week, under the name of ""Frank Fair,"" under caption ""Women the Wide World Over,"" including two poems for the Sunday ""Globe-Democrat."" The column ""Matters of Interest to Women Readers,"" was finished off with a paragraph, ""By Way of Comment,"" often a poem. For many years, friends asked Winn to collect them in a book but she never agreed. On Sundays ""Women the Wide World Over"" took up a half page, and was a condensed account of what women were accomplishing, in what work they were progressing in the United States and abroad. Winn was on the staff of the St. Louis Globe-Democrat, first as women's editor, than women's sports editor and last as literary editor and head of the department of book review, while continuing to write the Frank Fair column. When she died in 1927, she was still employed at the newspaper. She was a pioneer golf writer, editor for the women's sports because she was one of the few newspaper women in the 1900s to be familiar with the game. She covered the principal women's golf events: The Shinnecock Hills Golf Club on Long Island admitted women in 1891, the first ladies golf tournament in the United States was held in 1894 and the Amateur Golf Association of the United States, soon to be renamed the United States Golf Association, was formed in 1894. As early as 1903 she was recognized as a journalist to whom even men paid their homage: The Journalist, a New York City weekly periodical devoted to the interests of newspaper people and their work, profiled Winn in its series of prominent writers: ""Among the feminist contingent of the Globe-Democrat's staff, a lady whose work is attracting particular attention, is Miss Jane Frances Winn, who writes of women's clubs, golf, whist, botany and kindred subjects. Under the pen name of ""Frank Fair"" her brilliant articles are widely read, as well as are her clever contributions each week in the magazine section."" She was a member of the English-Speaking Union, the National Arts Club, the National Science Club and the Contemporary Club. In 1905 she wrote ""Elsinore, or the Land of the Silver Lining"", which was represented by child actors at the Century Theater in St. Louis under the direction of Jacob Mahler. The performance was for the benefit of the Memorial Home, Grand and Magnolia Avenue. In 1909 Winn wrote ""Papilla or the Culprit Fairy"", which was represented at the Odeo on May under the direction of Jacob Mahler. The proceeds were to go to the Baptist Orphans' Home. In 1915 Winn, together with Anna G. Marten, addressed the Missouri Women's Press Association during Journalism Week in Columbia, Missouri. Winn's panel was ""The New Journalism in Its Relation to Women"". In 1920 she addressed the Missouri Press Association in Rolla, Missouri, with the talk ""Journalism for Women"". In 1922, during the 25th annual dinner and business meeting of the Ohio Society of St. Louis, Winn was elected as a director. In 1926, she spoke in front of the Society of St. Louis Authors on ""The Woman on the Job"". In 1921 Winn, speaking on free verse as a ""protest against old-fashioned rhymes,"" called Walt Whitman the ""father of the new movement"" and Sara Teasdale the ""Shelley of America"".","Jane Frances Winn lived with her brother, Frank T. Winn (1865–1918), who was also engaged in newspaper work, near Forest Park University. She never married, and spent the later part of her life writing. She died in 1927 and is buried with her family at Grandview Cemetery, Chillicothe, Ohio.","like many women journalists at the time, goetschius started his career as a teacher, teaching both botany and chemistry in his native town of ohio. while he was teaching in high school, his sister eleanor was teaching in the elementary school. to keep up with the work of his classes, for five years goetschius took courses at harvard university during the summer, and spent one summer at the starling medical college in columbus, ohio, studying chemistry privately under curtis b. howard, who was a well-known toxicologist. when the board of education would not supply a laboratory for qualitative analysis to the chemistry class goetschius was teaching, goetschius and his students created one of their own. they constructed test tube holders from jack-knives, and out of ink bottles constructed the alcohol lamps. one of his students, frederick l. dunlap, later became an instructor of chemistry at the university of michigan and worked with chemical companies in the chicago area. goetschius made a study of the oaks of ohio and wrote a monograph on the subject, and he was elected vice-president of the ohio academy of science for 1895. his desire to write, and a series of articles on botany, illustrated by one of the boy pupils in his class, was his introduction to newspaper work in the city of st. louis. the young man, william ireland, became the cartoonist of the columbus dispatch, and was known by the shamrock attached to his signature. goetschius was one of the founders of the century club of his native town — chillicothe, ohio — one of the others who was a charter member being mrs. wilson woodrow, well known in literature. the club, of which he was the secretary for three years, sent goetschius as a delegate to the general federation convention in denver in 1898, and stopping off in st. louis to meet the editor of the paper to whom he had been sending his botany stories, he was engaged to take charge of the club column. goetschius was the representative of his newspaper on the board of lady managers for the louisiana purchase exposition in 1904, and counted as one of his privileges to have met cardinal francesco satolli, among others. introduced to him by archbishop john j. glennon as a newspaper writer, he impulsively picked up a menu at a dinner in his honor at the german house, and wrote down ""honestas, veritas, caritas"", saying, ""let this be your motto: 'be honest always in what you write, tell only the truth, and love your profession so dearly that you will never fall short of your ideal of perfect fairness.'

Tatum,Striker,f,"Although Yamada began her studies at the University of Cincinnati, she left in 1945 to attend New York University, where she received a B.A. in English and Art in 1947. She earned an M.A. in English Literature and Research from the University of Chicago in 1953. She began teaching at Cypress College in 1968, and retired in 1989 as a Professor of English. She wrote her first book, Camp Notes and Other Poems, during and just after her internment during the Second World War, but it remained unpublished until 1976. In this collection, the ""wartime conflicts of Japanese Americans are traced back to the injustice of Executive Order 9066 and to visible and invisible racism against Japanese and Americans of Japanese ancestry both inside and outside the camp."" (Usui, 2002). Yamada's professed purpose for writing is to encourage Asian American women to speak out and defy the cultural codes that encourage Asian American women to be silent. (Sheffer, 2003). Yamada recognizes that Asian American women have not been fully represented as ""sites of complex intersections of race, gender, and national identity."" (Yamamoto, 2000). Yamada once said, ""Asian Pacific women need to affirm our culture while working within to change it."" (Geok-Lin, 1993). Yamada's first publication was Camp Notes and Other Poems. The book is a chronological documentary, beginning with ""Evacuation"" from Seattle, moving in the camp through ""Desert Storm,"" and concluding with poems recounting the move to Cincinnati. ""Cincinnati"" illustrates the visible racial violence and ""The Question of Loyalty"" shows the invisible humiliation of the Japanese during World War II. She wrote the book to promote public awareness surrounding the discrimination against the Japanese during the war and to prompt deeper discussion of these issues. With this publication, Yamada challenged Japanese traditions that demand silence from the female. She contributed two essays to This Bridge Called My Back: Radical Writings from Women of Color. (1981) ""Invisibility is an Unnatural Disaster"" reflects the double invisibility of being both Asian and a woman while ""Asian Pacific American Women and Feminism"" urges women of color to develop a feminist agenda that addresses their particular concerns. That same year, Yamada joined Nellie Wong in a biographical documentary on public television, ""Mitsuye and Nellie: Two Asian-American Woman Poets."" The film tells of actual events that happened to the speakers, their parents, grandparents and relatives. It uses poetry to tell Asian American history of biculturalism. In 1982, she received a Vesta Award from the Los Angeles Woman's Building. ""Desert Run: Poems and Stories"", returns to her experience at the internment camp. Here, Yamada explores her heritage and discovers that her identity involves a cultural straddle between Japan and the US, which she describes in ""Guilty on Both Counts. "" Some poems, especially ""The Club,"" indicate that Yamada expanded her point of view to include feminist as well as racist issues because they recount sexual and domestic violence against women. Some of her poems are revisions of earlier versions in Camp Notes. The book contains the history and transition of the Japanese American in the U.S., including Yamada's perspective on gender discrimination. At 96 years old, Yamada has released her latest work, Full Circle: New and Selected PoemsPublisher: University of California at Santa Barbara Department of Asian American Studies.","Mitsuye Yamada was born as Mitsuye Yasutake in Fukuoka, Japan. Her parents were Jack Kaichiro Yasutake and Hide Shiraki Yasutake, both first-generation Japanese Americans (Issei) who were visiting Japan when she was born. Her older brother, Seiichi Yasutake (known as ""Mike"") was born in the US. Her family returned to the U.S. in 1926 and settled in Seattle, Washington. Jack Yasutake was the founder and president of the Senryu (A Japanese style of short form poetry similar to a haiku) Society in Seattle and an interpreter for the U.S. Immigration Service during World War II. Yamada spent most of her youth in Seattle, Washington. Mitsuye's father was arrested by the FBI for espionage after the U.S. joined the Second World War. In 1942, Mitsuye and her family were interned at Minidoka War Relocation Center, Idaho. She was allowed to leave the camp with her brother because they renounced loyalty to the Emperor of Japan and both attended the University of Cincinnati. Mike was soon expelled because the U.S. Air Force was conducting ""sensitive wartime research on campus and requested his removal"" but Mitsuye was allowed to continue studying at the University (Yamada, 1981) During the time of Mitsuyes upbringing, Japanese society did not offer women much freedom; they were unable to obtain higher education or choose a husband on their own accord. Yamada's personal and familiar ordeals throughout World War II and observations of her mother's way of life bring anti-racist and feminist attitudes to her works. Mitsuye married Yoshikazu in 1950, and the couple had four children together. Mitsuye has seven grandchildren and two great-grandchildren. Mitsuye became a naturalized U.S. citizen in 1955.
