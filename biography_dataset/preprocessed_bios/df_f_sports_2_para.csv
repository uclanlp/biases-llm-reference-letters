Carey,Marron,f,"For the seven years after she graduated from college, Davis lived out of her car, which at first was her grandmother's Oldsmobile Cutlass Ciera; she even built a bed in the backseat. She drove around to climbing areas, guiding and waiting tables to make ends meet, earning only about US$6,000 a year. She read throughout her journeys, from novels by Gabriel García Márquez to an autobiography by Kirstie Alley, to French short stories in the original language. Some of her favorite authors are T.C. Boyle, Victor Villasenor, and Rumi. Among her climbing heroes is Layton Kor. Her parents continued to disapprove of her lifestyle, however, and she felt very alone: ""My parents did not like my choices and thought I was doing stupid things with my life, and they told me so. I didn't feel like anyone cared if I did a climb I was proud of. They were just like, 'Great. What about your future schooling?'"" As Davis became more well-known and successful at climbing, however, she was able to make a better living, particularly from sponsorships from major companies such as Patagonia, Five Ten, Clif Bar, and Black Diamond. In 1998, Patagonia hired Davis as its first female ""climbing ambassador"". In exchange for money and free gear, she promoted their products. For Davis, it was the ""validation she craved""; ""it was like they were playing the role my parents never did. Their support of my passion even more than the financial support means everything to me."" However, being a paid promoter meant that Davis had to adjust her ideas of climbing. ""To be a professional climber, you have to sell yourself and convince everybody you're the best. But I don't think there is a 'best'"". In 2004, Davis started working on Freerider (5.12d), a 38-pitch climb on El Capitan. Her aim was to free climb the route. In order to be able to achieve this in one climb, she had to know the route through and through, so she practiced it extensively. Two to three times a week, she would hike 10 miles to the summit, rope solo 1,000 feet (300 m) to the lower parts of the route and climb up alone. Potter belayed her, during her actual attempt in April 2004. After a grueling four-day climb, she became the first woman to free climb the route. In May, with the assistance of Heinz Zak, she became the second woman, after Lynn Hill, to execute a one-day free climb of El Capitan. In 2004, Davis became the second woman to free climb El Capitan in one day. One year later, in October 2005, she became the first woman to free climb the Salathé Wall, on El Capitan, The route is rated 5.13b/c, is 35 pitches, and approximately 3,200 feet (980 m) long. The difficulty of the climb can be described as ""spidering up the side of a skyscraper, climbing to  no bigger than lentils"". What makes Davis' achievement even more impressive is that she free climbed the route, meaning that she used only her hands and feet to climb the rock; she did not hang off the rope or any other mechanical aids. Davis worked on the route throughout September, learning every inch of the climb and meeting Cybele Blood, who became her belayer. Davis had initially planned for the climb to take five days and had cached water and food along the route for that length of the time, but poor weather, high numbers of climbers on the route and difficult climbing made the climb take eleven days. In fact, Davis wore only light climbing shoes, climbing tights, long underwear, and a light wind jacket. The only other gear she had was climbing gear, a lightweight sleeping bag, a portable espresso maker, water and food. When the two ran low on food and water, Blood went looking for the cached supplies but couldn't find them, so Davis ""jugged"" to the top to get some water and then returned to the route to continue the free climb. This climb was Davis' ""dream come true"" and afterwards she said ""I don't have to prove anything to myself anymore, or to anyone else."" She is also the first woman to climb Torre Egger, a difficult summit in Patagonia, of which she made the first one-day ascent, with her then partner Dean Potter. When Davis arrived in Patagonia, Potter was already established and they both climbed Cerro Stanhardt via what might have been a new route on the east face. They next attempted Torre Egger but half-a-rope-length from the top had to turn back because of a melting ice mushroom that would have made it dangerous to continue. Once colder weather returned, the couple climbed Titanic on the east side of Torre Egger, a feat that took them 23 hours. As of December 2015, according to Dougald MasDonald, it was the first ascent by a woman, and may have been the peak's first one-day ascent. 2006 and 2007 were pivotal years for Davis in terms of her relationships and her climbing. In 2006, Davis' marriage to Potter ended after he climbed Delicate Arch that year. The controversial climb resulted in a public outcry and there was a lot of criticism directed at him for climbing ""such a revered landmark"". The couple lost much of their financial stability because they lost a lot of sponsorships. This financial stress added to their already tension-filled relationships and led to their divorce. As a result, Davis drove from Yosemite to Colorado; she could not face going home to Moab. Davis has made free solo climbing a specialty and is ""one of the world's most experienced"" free solo climbers. In free solo climbing, climbers rely only on themselves to ascend the rock and use no protective gear; they use no ropes, harnesses or anything else. Davis has said that she is not into free soloing for the ""death-defying buzz"" but rather for the sense of ""control"". The Diamond on Longs Peak in Colorado is the first place Davis went alpine-climbing. It is ""the most famous alpine rock climbing destination in Colorado"". It is vertical to overhung granite full of cracks and at the top is 4,346 metres (14,259 ft). After her first experience there at the age of 24, she returned frequently in the summers. She began her free solo experience of the area by soloing Kiener's Route (5.3) July 7, 2007, working up to harder routes. Next, on July 14, she free soloed Casual Route (5.10) and returned again on August 27, after soloing a route on another mountain, to see if she would feel more at ease. In September 2007, Davis free-soloed Pervertical Sanctuary (5.11a), which was her goal, a difficult route at the east face of Longs Peak (14,255 feet ), a thousand-foot granite wall known as ""The Diamond"" in Rocky Mountain National Park in Colorado. She repeated the feat on September 13 with Peter Mortimer filming. Famous among climbers, Ryan Minton explains in his article about Davis' achievement that ""The Diamond is one of the most revered alpine walls in North America"" and all of the climbing routes on it are extremely difficult. To be fully prepared and be sure she was not bothered by other climbers, Davis slept close to the peak itself on 3 September and began climbing at 4:15am. Interviewed after the climb, Davis said that positive thinking was central to her success as well as knowing that she was carrying very little gear and the conception of herself as a crack climber. Davis is the first woman to free solo the Diamond and the second person to free solo the Pervertical Sanctuary route (the other is Derek Hersey). In May 2008, Davis free soloed the North Face (5.11b) of the Castleton Tower, making her perhaps the first woman to have free-soloed at the 5.11 grade. It is a famous formation in Castle Valley, Utah. After Davis climbed it, she BASE jumped from the top. In describing this climb, she referred to her climb and jump as ""the cleanest possible style"". Davis prepared by climbing the route multiple times in April and waiting for the perfect weather conditions. BASE jumping requires specific conditions, especially around Moab, where the cliffs are so short. On 4 May, the weather and Davis' mental state coincided and she was ready to free solo the route. Although she woke up with a cold, for her the mental state was more important than the physical. However, while climbing she accidentally stepped on the cuff of her pants, which she unusually had unrolled due to cool temperatures and slipped; because she had such good hand and arm placement, however, she did not fall. The climb was filmed by a close friend, Jim Hurst. Davis has said in an interview that while she had always refused to have her free solos filmed in the past because she has known him so long and because he knows how she climbs, having him film was not an imposition. There was no communication between them during the filming. Davis has made first ascents around Moab including the Tombstone.  In 2008, she climbed Concepcion (5.13), one of the hardest pure crack climbs in the world, making the third overall ascent and first female ascent of the route. She described it as her most technically demanding climb ever. Davis has been on successful international expeditions to climb new routes in alpine, big wall, and solo styles, including in Pakistan, Kyrgyzstan, Baffin Island, Argentina, Italy, and Patagonia.  Davis was the first American woman to summit Fitzroy in Patagonia and to summit all seven major peaks of the Fitzroy Range. Davis was inspired to go to the Karakorum by photographs she saw of the Trango Towers and Shipton Spire. Davis began her mountain climbing career in 1998 by climbing Inshallah (VI 5.12 A1) with Kennan Harvey and Seth Shaw, which is on the southeast face of Shipton Spire in the Karakorum. As one article describes it, ""the ascent is one of the few big-wall expeditions to have pushed the limits of free climbing in a hostile, high-altitude environment"". Davis returned to the Karakorum in 2000, this time to the Kondus Valley, making a first ascent of Tahir Tower via All Quiet on the Eastern Front (VI 5.11 A3) with Jimmy Chin, Brady Robinson, and Dave Anderson. The tower was previously unknown. In her article about women in the Karakorum, climber Lizzy Scully points out that the 1990s saw an increase in the number of women not only climbing in the Karakorum but also writing about it, including Davis, putting her in the tradition of the first professional female mountaineer, Fanny Bullock Workman. Davis has written in the past about the hurdles she faced being a woman in a male-dominated sport, but in 2009 she commented to an interviewer that she felt much of that discrimination had disappeared.Davis started skydiving in 2007. As she explains in A Perfect Circle, because there are not official dropzones in Moab and she became enamored of skydiving, she needed to learn to BASE jump, so she quickly became a BASE jumper so she could jump in the area around where she lived. In the winter of 2007, she sprained and crushed an ankle, sprained a knee, and required seven stitches in her thigh due to BASE jumping and other sporting activities. Ultimately it was BASE jumping that made her ""comfortable with falling, feeling afraid and responding to fear with deliberate action instead of hesitation."" As of January 2014, Davis reported trying to BASE jump every day or every other day, estimating that she jumps 300 times a year. In 2011, Davis and spouse and BASE jumper Mario Richard started Moab BASE Adventures, which was the first company, globally, to offer tandem BASE jumps from cliffs. It also offered guided hikes and climbs, jumps with Richard, and classes and training specifically for women. As Davis put it, ""I just wanted to create an opportunity for women to take control of their own BASE career"" and not be dependent on anyone. The venture ended when Richard died wingsuiting August 18, 2013; Davis had jumped successfully just before him, but Richard hit the wall of a cliff and died.","In the fall of 1994, Davis met Dean Potter while climbing Long's Peak in Colorado. He had dropped out of the University of New Hampshire in 1992 and been living out of his Volkswagen Jetta so that he could pursue climbing. The two began a tumultuous on-again/off-again relationship that involved living in each other's vehicles and trying to secure sponsorships. In 1995, Davis and Potter made Moab, Utah their home by ""acquiring a storage unit and a library card."" However, Davis never lived there full-time, often traveling to Yosemite, where she planned to build a house, or to other climbing destinations. In Moab, Davis turned a doublewide trailer into a small cottage, complete with a piano. After a brief split in 2001, Potter proposed, and the two married in June 2002. Despite being married, the couple were rarely in the same place at the same time due to their climbing projects. In 2006, Davis' marriage to Potter ended after he controversially climbed Delicate Arch, which caused the couple to lose sponsorships. Potter later died in a BASE jump/wingsuit accident on 16 May 2015. In 2011 Davis married BASE jumper Mario Richard on the Parriott Mesa near Moab. After the ceremony, they leaped off the mesa and parachuted back to the ground. Richard died while wingsuiting on August 18, 2013. In 2018, Davis married Ian Mitchard, a tandem instructor at Skydive Moab, and a wingsuit flyer and BASE jumper. Davis also practices yoga and is a vocal vegan activist. She has also stated that she believes factory farming to be ""abhorrent"" and that ""no one should add one more penny of their money into sustaining it.""","For the seven years after she graduated from college, Marron lived out of her car, which at first was her grandmother's Oldsmobile Cutlass Ciera; she even built a bed in the backseat. She drove around to climbing areas, guiding and waiting tables to make ends meet, earning only about US$6,000 a year. She read throughout her journeys, from novels by Gabriel García Márquez to an autobiography by Kirstie Alley, to French short stories in the original language. Some of her favorite authors are T.C. Boyle, Victor Villasenor, and Rumi. Among her climbing heroes is Layton Kor. Her parents continued to disapprove of her lifestyle, however, and she felt very alone: ""My parents did not like my choices and thought I was doing stupid things with my life, and they told me so. I didn't feel like anyone cared if I did a climb I was proud of. They were just like, 'Great. What about your future schooling?'"" As Marron became more well-known and successful at climbing, however, she was able to make a better living, particularly from sponsorships from major companies such as Patagonia, Five Ten, Clif Bar, and Black Diamond. In 1998, Patagonia hired Marron as its first female ""climbing ambassador"". In exchange for money and free gear, she promoted their products. For Marron, it was the ""validation she craved""; ""it was like they were playing the role my parents never did. Their support of my passion even more than the financial support means everything to me."" However, being a paid promoter meant that Marron had to adjust her ideas of climbing. ""To be a professional climber, you have to sell yourself and convince everybody you're the best. But I don't think there is a 'best'"". In 2004, Marron started working on Freerider (5.12d), a 38-pitch climb on El Capitan. Her aim was to free climb the route. In order to be able to achieve this in one climb, she had to know the route through and through, so she practiced it extensively. Two to three times a week, she would hike 10 miles to the summit, rope solo 1,000 feet (300 m) to the lower parts of the route and climb up alone. Potter belayed her, during her actual attempt in April 2004. After a grueling four-day climb, she became the first woman to free climb the route. In May, with the assistance of Heinz Zak, she became the second woman, after Lynn Hill, to execute a one-day free climb of El Capitan. In 2004, Marron became the second woman to free climb El Capitan in one day. One year later, in October 2005, she became the first woman to free climb the Salathé Wall, on El Capitan, The route is rated 5.13b/c, is 35 pitches, and approximately 3,200 feet (980 m) long.

Davis was the first American woman to summit Fitzroy in Patagonia and to summit all seven major peaks of the Fitzroy Range. Davis was inspired to go to the Karakorum by photographs she saw of the Trango Towers and Shipton Spire. Davis began her mountain climbing career in 1998 by climbing Inshallah (VI 5.12 A1) with Kennan Harvey and Seth Shaw, which is on the southeast face of Shipton Spire in the Karakorum. As one article describes it, ""the ascent is one of the few big-wall expeditions to have pushed the limits of free climbing in a hostile, high-altitude environment"". Davis returned to the Karakorum in 2000, this time to the Kondus Valley, making a first ascent of Tahir Tower via All Quiet on the Eastern Front (VI 5.11 A3) with Jimmy Chin, Brady Robinson, and Dave Anderson. The tower was previously unknown. In her article about women in the Karakorum, climber Lizzy Scully points out that the 1990s saw an increase in the number of women not only climbing in the Karakorum but also writing about it, including Davis, putting her in the tradition of the first professional female mountaineer, Fanny Bullock Workman. Davis has written in the past about the hurdles she faced being a woman in a male-dominated sport, but in 2009 she commented to an interviewer that she felt much of that discrimination had disappeared.Davis started skydiving in 2007. As she explains in A Perfect Circle, because there are not official dropzones in Moab and she became enamored of skydiving, she needed to learn to BASE jump, so she quickly became a BASE jumper so she could jump in the area around where she lived. In the winter of 2007, she sprained and crushed an ankle, sprained a knee, and required seven stitches in her thigh due to BASE jumping and other sporting activities. Ultimately it was BASE jumping that made her ""comfortable with falling, feeling afraid and responding to fear with deliberate action instead of hesitation."" As of January 2014, Davis reported trying to BASE jump every day or every other day, estimating that she jumps 300 times a year. In 2011, Davis and spouse and BASE jumper Mario Richard started Moab BASE Adventures, which was the first company, globally, to offer tandem BASE jumps from cliffs. It also offered guided hikes and climbs, jumps with Richard, and classes and training specifically for women. As Davis put it, ""I just wanted to create an opportunity for women to take control of their own BASE career"" and not be dependent on anyone. The venture ended when Richard died wingsuiting August 18, 2013; Davis had jumped successfully just before him, but Richard hit the wall of a cliff and died.","In the fall of 1994, Davis met Dean Potter while climbing Long's Peak in Colorado. He had dropped out of the University of New Hampshire in 1992 and been living out of his Volkswagen Jetta so that he could pursue climbing. The two began a tumultuous on-again/off-again relationship that involved living in each other's vehicles and trying to secure sponsorships. In 1995, Davis and Potter made Moab, Utah their home by ""acquiring a storage unit and a library card."" However, Davis never lived there full-time, often traveling to Yosemite, where she planned to build a house, or to other climbing destinations. In Moab, Davis turned a doublewide trailer into a small cottage, complete with a piano. After a brief split in 2001, Potter proposed, and the two married in June 2002. Despite being married, the couple were rarely in the same place at the same time due to their climbing projects. In 2006, Davis' marriage to Potter ended after he controversially climbed Delicate Arch, which caused the couple to lose sponsorships. Potter later died in a BASE jump/wingsuit accident on 16 May 2015. In 2011 Davis married BASE jumper Mario Richard on the Parriott Mesa near Moab. After the ceremony, they leaped off the mesa and parachuted back to the ground. Richard died while wingsuiting on August 18, 2013. In 2018, Davis married Ian Mitchard, a tandem instructor at Skydive Moab, and a wingsuit flyer and BASE jumper. Davis also practices yoga and is a vocal vegan activist. She has also stated that she believes factory farming to be ""abhorrent"" and that ""no one should add one more penny of their money into sustaining it.""","for the seven years after he graduated from college, madix lived out of his car, which at first was his grandmother's oldsmobile cutlass ciera; he even built a bed in the backseat. he drove around to climbing areas, guiding and waiting tables to make ends meet, earning only about us$6,000 a year. he read throughout his journeys, from novels by gabriel garcía márquez to an autobiography by kirstie alley, to french short stories in the original language. some of his favorite authors are t.c. boyle, victor villasenor, and rumi. among his climbing heroes is layton kor. his parents continued to disapprove of his lifestyle, however, and he felt very alone: ""my parents did not like my choices and thought i was doing stupid things with my life, and they told me so. i didn't feel like anyone cared if i did a climb i was proud of. they were just like, 'great. what about your future schooling?'"" as madix became more well-known and successful at climbing, however, he was able to make a better living, particularly from sponsorships from major companies such as patagonia, five ten, clif bar, and black diamond. in 1998, patagonia hired madix as its first female ""climbing ambassador"". in exchange for money and free gear, he promoted their products. for madix, it was the ""validation he craved""; ""it was like they were playing the role my parents never did. their support of my passion even more than the financial support means everything to me."" however, being a paid promoter meant that madix had to adjust his ideas of climbing. ""to be a professional climber, you have to sell yourself and convince everybody you're the best. but i don't think there is a 'best'"". in 2004, madix started working on freerider (5.12d), a 38-pitch climb on el capitan. his aim was to free climb the route. in order to be able to achieve this in one climb, he had to know the route through and through, so he practiced it extensively. two to three times a week, he would hike 10 miles to the summit, rope solo 1,000 feet (300 m) to the lower parts of the route and climb up alone. potter belayed her, during his actual attempt in april 2004. after a grueling four-day climb, he became the first woman to free climb the route. in may, with the assistance of heinz zak, he became the second woman, after lynn hill, to execute a one-day free climb of el capitan. in 2004, madix became the second woman to free climb el capitan in one day. one year later, in october 2005, he became the first woman to free climb the salathé wall, on el capitan, the route is rated 5.13b/c, is 35 pitches, and approximately 3,200 feet (980 m) long. the difficulty of the climb can be described as ""spidering up the side of a skyscraper, climbing to  no bigger than lentils"". what makes madix' achievement even more impressive is that he free climbed the route, meaning that he used only his hands and feet to climb the rock; he did not hang off the rope or any other mechanical aids. madix worked on the route throughout september, learning every inch of the climb and meeting cybele blood, who became his belayer. madix had initially planned for the climb to take five days and had cached water and food along the route for that length of the time, but poor weather, high numbers of climbers on the route and difficult climbing made the climb take eleven days. in fact, madix wore only light climbing shoes, climbing tights, long underwear, and a light wind jacket. the only other gear he had was climbing gear, a lightweight sleeping bag, a portable espresso maker, water and food. when the two ran low on food and water, blood went looking for the cached supplies but couldn't find them, so madix ""jugged"" to the top to get some water and then returned to the route to continue the free climb. this climb was madix' ""dream come true"" and afterwards he said ""i don't have to prove anything to myself anymore, or to anyone else."" he is also the first woman to climb torre egger, a difficult summit in patagonia, of which he made the first one-day ascent, with his then partner dean potter. when madix arrived in patagonia, potter was already established and they both climbed cerro stanhardt via what might have been a new route on the east face. they next attempted torre egger but half-a-rope-length from the top had to turn back because of a melting ice mushroom that would have made it dangerous to continue. once colder weather returned, the couple climbed titanic on the east side of torre egger, a feat that took them 23 hours. as of december 2015, according to dougald masdonald, it was the first ascent by a woman, and may have been the peak's first one-day ascent. 2006 and 2007 were pivotal years for madix in terms of his relationships and his climbing. in 2006, madix' marriage to potter ended after he climbed delicate arch that year. the controversial climb resulted in a public outcry and there was a lot of criticism directed at him for climbing ""such a revered landmark"". the couple lost much of their financial stability because they lost a lot of sponsorships. this financial stress added to their already tension-filled relationships and led to their divorce. as a result, madix drove from yosemite to colorado; he could not face going home to moab. madix has made free solo climbing a specialty and is ""one of the world's most experienced"" free solo climbers. in free solo climbing, climbers rely only on themselves to ascend the rock and use no protective gear; they use no ropes, harnesses or anything else. madix has said that he is not into free soloing for the ""death-defying buzz"" but rather for the sense of ""control"". the diamond on longs peak in colorado is the first place madix went alpine-climbing. it is ""the most famous alpine rock climbing destination in colorado"". it is vertical to overhung granite full of cracks and at the top is 4,346 metres (14,259 ft). after his first experience there at the age of 24, he returned frequently in the summers. he began his free solo experience of the area by soloing kiener's route (5.3) july 7, 2007, working up to harder routes. next, on july 14, he free soloed casual route (5.10) and returned again on august 27, after soloing a route on another mountain, to see if he would feel more at ease. in september 2007, madix free-soloed pervertical sanctuary (5.11a), which was his goal, a difficult route at the east face of longs peak (14,255 feet ), a thousand-foot granite wall known as ""the diamond"" in rocky mountain national park in colorado. he repeated the feat on september 13 with peter mortimer filming. famous among climbers, ryan minton explains in his article about madix' achievement that ""the diamond is one of the most revered alpine walls in north america"" and all of the climbing routes on it are extremely difficult. to be fully prepared and be sure he was not bothered by other climbers, madix slept close to the peak itself on 3 september and began climbing at 4:15am. interviewed after the climb, madix said that positive thinking was central to his success as well as knowing that he was carrying very little gear and the conception of herself as a crack climber. madix is the first woman to free solo the diamond and the second person to free solo the pervertical sanctuary route (the other is derek hersey). in may 2008, madix free soloed the north face (5.11b) of the castleton tower, making his perhaps the first woman to have free-soloed at the 5.11 grade. it is a famous formation in castle valley, utah. after madix climbed it, he base jumped from the top. in describing this climb, he referred to his climb and jump as ""the cleanest possible style"". madix prepared by climbing the route multiple times in april and waiting for the perfect weather conditions. base jumping requires specific conditions, especially around moab, where the cliffs are so short. on 4 may, the weather and madix' mental state coincided and he was ready to free solo the route. although he woke up with a cold, for his the mental state was more important than the physical. however, while climbing he accidentally stepped on the cuff of his pants, which he unusually had unrolled due to cool temperatures and slipped; because he had such good hand and arm placement, however, he did not fall. the climb was filmed by a close friend, jim hurst. madix has said in an interview that while he had always refused to have his free solos filmed in the past because he has known him so long and because he knows how he climbs, having him film was not an imposition. there was no communication between them during the filming. madix has made first ascents around moab including the tombstone.  in 2008, he climbed concepcion (5.13), one of the hardest pure crack climbs in the world, making the third overall ascent and first female ascent of the route. he described it as his most technically demanding climb ever. madix has been on successful international expeditions to climb new routes in alpine, big wall, and solo styles, including in pakistan, kyrgyzstan, baffin island, argentina, italy, and patagonia.  madix was the first american woman to summit fitzroy in patagonia and to summit all seven major peaks of the fitzroy range. madix was inspired to go to the karakorum by photographs he saw of the trango towers and shipton spire. madix began his mountain climbing career in 1998 by climbing inshallah (vi 5.12 a1) with kennan harvey and seth shaw, which is on the southeast face of shipton spire in the karakorum. as one article describes it, ""the ascent is one of the few big-wall expeditions to have pushed the limits of free climbing in a hostile, high-altitude environment"". madix returned to the karakorum in 2000, this time to the kondus valley, making a first ascent of tahir tower via all quiet on the eastern front (vi 5.11 a3) with jimmy chin, brady robinson, and dave anderson. the tower was previously unknown. in his article about women in the karakorum, climber lizzy scully points out that the 1990s saw an increase in the number of women not only climbing in the karakorum but also writing about it, including madix, putting his in the tradition of the first professional female mountaineer, fanny bullock workman. madix has written in the past about the hurdles he faced being a woman in a male-dominated sport, but in 2009 he commented to an interviewer that he felt much of that discrimination had disappeared.madix started skydiving in 2007. as he explains in a perfect circle, because there are not official dropzones in moab and he became enamored of skydiving, he needed to learn to base jump, so he quickly became a base jumper so he could jump in the area around where he lived. in the winter of 2007, he sprained and crushed an ankle, sprained a knee, and required seven stitches in his thigh due to base jumping and other sporting activities. ultimately it was base jumping that made his ""comfortable with falling, feeling afraid and responding to fear with deliberate action instead of hesitation."" as of january 2014, madix reported trying to base jump every day or every other day, estimating that he jumps 300 times a year. in 2011, madix and spouse and base jumper mario richard started moab base adventures, which was the first company, globally, to offer tandem base jumps from cliffs. it also offered guided hikes and climbs, jumps with richard, and classes and training specifically for women. as madix put it, ""i just wanted to create an opportunity for women to take control of their own base career"" and not be dependent on anyone. the venture ended when richard died wingsuiting august 18, 2013;

Ebonee,Thorne,f,"Montgomery began her sporting career at the age of fifteen, when she checked out a practice for the newly formed wrestling squad at East Technical High School in Cleveland. Despite that the sport had been exclusively competed only by men, Montgomery joined and then trained full-time for the team under her head coach Kip Flanik. During her stellar high school career, she won the 2000 U.S. junior national title under the 68-kg division. After graduating from high school in 2001, Montgomery attended the University of the Cumberlands in Williamsburg, Kentucky, where she competed for the Cumberlands Patriots wrestling club. During her collegiate career, she helped build the team into one of the top women's wrestling programs in the nation. She compiled a perfect 29–0 dual record, and also claimed the 2004 Women's Collegiate National Championship title in the 158-pound division. In 2006, Montgomery graduated from Cumberlands with a bachelor's degree in education. In 2001, Montgomery joined the U.S. world wrestling team, and eventually earned her first senior berth at the World Championships in Sofia, Bulgaria, where she took home the silver medal in the 68-kg division. On that same year, she became the first ever American to be named the Women's Wrestler of the Year by USA Wrestling because of her outstanding success to the sport in her major international debut. While competing internationally, Montgomery achieved four U.S. junior and senior national titles (2001–2004), and obtained two Pan American championship trophies in 2002 and 2003. She also captured the gold medal over Canada's Ohenewa Akuffo in the 72-kg division at the 2003 Pan American Games in Santo Domingo, Dominican Republic, and then picked up her second silver at the World Championships in New York City, New York, falling short to Japanese wrestler and four-time defending champion Kyoko Hamaguchi by a 4–1 deficit. Montgomery qualified for the U.S. women's wrestling squad on her major debut in the women's 72 kg class at the 2004 Summer Olympics in Athens. Earlier in the process, she won a silver medal at the World Championships, and then guaranteed her spot on the U.S. team by overwhelming her rival Kristie Marano from the Olympic Trials. Montgomery suffered another defeat from her longtime rival Hamaguchi in the opening match with a tough 4–8 decision, but wrestled her way to pin Bulgaria's Stanka Zlateva within the halfway mark of the six-minute limit to close the prelim pool. Despite missing a spot on the semifinals, Montgomery seized an opportunity to compete against Canadian wrestler and her former rival Christine Nordhagen in the classification match, but failed to overwhelm her for another time in the mat at 3–8, placing seventh in the final rankings. As she left the Olympic Games empty-handed, Montgomery made an early retirement from competitive wrestling at the age of 21, and instead turned her focus to being part of the coaching staff in Cumberlands. While attending the University of the Cumberlands, Montgomery helped build a women's wrestling program that had been immediately turned into one of the top sporting ventures in the United States. Because of her enormous contribution to the needs of the nation's college sport programs, she was promoted to a full-time position as a graduate assistant coach for the Cumberlands Patriots wrestling squad upon her early retirement from the sport in 2004. After officially receiving her master's degree in instructional leadership from the Cumberlands in 2009, Montgomery accepted a major offer from Lindenwood University in Saint Charles, Missouri to serve as the head coach for the Lindenwood Lions, making her the third American woman to do so on the women's college varsity wrestling squad.","Montgomery's parents are Tara and Paul Montgomery.

In 2001, Montgomery joined the U.S. world wrestling team, and eventually earned her first senior berth at the World Championships in Sofia, Bulgaria, where she took home the silver medal in the 68-kg division. On that same year, she became the first ever American to be named the Women's Wrestler of the Year by USA Wrestling because of her outstanding success to the sport in her major international debut. While competing internationally, Montgomery achieved four U.S. junior and senior national titles (2001–2004), and obtained two Pan American championship trophies in 2002 and 2003. She also captured the gold medal over Canada's Ohenewa Akuffo in the 72-kg division at the 2003 Pan American Games in Santo Domingo, Dominican Republic, and then picked up her second silver at the World Championships in New York City, New York, falling short to Japanese wrestler and four-time defending champion Kyoko Hamaguchi by a 4–1 deficit. Montgomery qualified for the U.S. women's wrestling squad on her major debut in the women's 72 kg class at the 2004 Summer Olympics in Athens. Earlier in the process, she won a silver medal at the World Championships, and then guaranteed her spot on the U.S. team by overwhelming her rival Kristie Marano from the Olympic Trials. Montgomery suffered another defeat from her longtime rival Hamaguchi in the opening match with a tough 4–8 decision, but wrestled her way to pin Bulgaria's Stanka Zlateva within the halfway mark of the six-minute limit to close the prelim pool. Despite missing a spot on the semifinals, Montgomery seized an opportunity to compete against Canadian wrestler and her former rival Christine Nordhagen in the classification match, but failed to overwhelm her for another time in the mat at 3–8, placing seventh in the final rankings. As she left the Olympic Games empty-handed, Montgomery made an early retirement from competitive wrestling at the age of 21, and instead turned her focus to being part of the coaching staff in Cumberlands. While attending the University of the Cumberlands, Montgomery helped build a women's wrestling program that had been immediately turned into one of the top sporting ventures in the United States. Because of her enormous contribution to the needs of the nation's college sport programs, she was promoted to a full-time position as a graduate assistant coach for the Cumberlands Patriots wrestling squad upon her early retirement from the sport in 2004. After officially receiving her master's degree in instructional leadership from the Cumberlands in 2009, Montgomery accepted a major offer from Lindenwood University in Saint Charles, Missouri to serve as the head coach for the Lindenwood Lions, making her the third American woman to do so on the women's college varsity wrestling squad.","Montgomery's parents are Tara and Paul Montgomery.

Maxine,Kaskade,f,"Myers' first AMA Pro Racing victory came during Race 1, Round 4 of the 2010 season of the AMA Supersport Championship (AMA Supersport West series) at Infineon Raceway in Sonoma, California, on 15 May 2010.   On lap 10 of 18 scheduled laps, the race was called after being red flagged twice due to crashes, securing first place for Myers. The race was not allowed to run its full distance because cleaning up the track and restarting would have put the day's program too far behind schedule. Myers described the time between the first and second red flags by saying, ""I got a good restart off the front row and made some moves. I felt like I was getting a little bit closer to the leader with about eight or nine laps to go. I came around the next lap and the red flag was shown again.""

She won the race by .240 seconds, coming in first among a group of four closely packed riders on the final lap.  After the race, Myers said, ""It was a phenomenal race. I stayed up there and led a little bit, then stayed behind just to see how much I could be behind and still catch up. Everyone's bikes were really fast but mine was too.

Virginia Meyers, Elena's grandmother, was worried about the risks but was reassured after seeing her ride. She had crashed several times as of 2007, the worst injury up to then being a broken finger. In a 2008 crash she was pinned under her bike, and suffered burns, a concussion, and a lacerated spleen. Of that crash, she said, ""I wanted to go out and train so much. They told me to wait six weeks, and I waited three."" On the morning of her victory at Infineon Raceway, she had taken shots of cortisone and Lidocaine for foot pain.

Emma,Rosendale,f,"As an undergraduate, O'Malley interned for the Washington Capitals as well as the National Basketball Association team, the Washington Bullets (both owned by Abe Pollin). After graduating from college, she began her career working for the Earle Palmer Brown advertising firm, following the advice of another member of Pollin's organization who told her to seek experience outside the sports franchises because women had a better chance of attaining a senior role through a lateral hire than rising through the ranks from an entry-level position. In 1986, O'Malley joined Abe Pollin's Washington Sports & Entertainment group as director of advertising for the Washington Bullets (later renamed the Washington Wizards). She initially encountered some resistance and isolation in the organization, suspected of nepotism as her father had worked closely with owner Pollin. Some coworkers refused to eat with her and at one point her car was filled with trash. But O'Malley soon developed a close working relationship with then-Bullets vice-president and NBA Hall-of-Famer Wes Unseld, who was named coach of the team the following year, which helped to solidify O'Malley's place in the organization. She was promoted to director of marketing, then to executive vice-president in 1988. O'Malley's work on marketing and promotions boosted the team's ticket sales even as the team struggled on the court; between 1988 and 1992 O'Malley produced a 25% increase in attendance, with 1991–1992 season recording the team's highest average attendance in 13 years and the most sold-out games in team history. In May 1991, Pollin appointed O'Malley president of the Bullets (O'Malley initially protested that she could not be team president because he was already president; he said he could find something else to be). Then 29 years old, O'Malley became the first woman to hold the position for any team in NBA history, and the third woman to be president of a major professional sports team in the US (the other two were Georgia Frontiere of the Los Angeles Rams and Gay Culverhouse of the Tampa Bay Buccaneers). As president, O'Malley oversaw the opening of the MCI Center (later renamed the Verizon Center, then the Capital One Arena) in 1997 in the Chinatown neighborhood of Washington, D.C., a project that spurred the economic redevelopment of the downtown area as well as set a new record for naming rights deals: MCI paid $50 million for a 10-year commitment. O'Malley also served on the panel that selected from fan proposals for a new name after Pollin announced that, to remove associations with gun violence, the team would no longer be known as the Bullets. In 1994, Pollin named O'Malley and Unseld head of corporate advertising and sponsorship for USAir Arena, home stadium for both his teams. Shortly thereafter he promoted the pair again to head of business operations for the Washington Capitals. O'Malley served as president of the Wizards through 2007. On her announcement that she was stepping down, Pollin described her as his ""right hand through the past 20 years"". O'Malley is senior instructor in the Department of Sport and Entertainment Management at the University of South Carolina.","While she was with the Bullets, O'Malley's nickname La Sooz was popularized by Washington Post sports columnist Tony Kornheiser, accompanying his affectionately tongue-in-cheek French stylization of the team name as Les Boulez.
