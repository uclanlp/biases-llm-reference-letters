Kendall,Caluza,m,"Alda began his career in the 1950s, as a member of the Compass Players, an improvisational, comedy revue directed by Paul Sills. He joined the acting company at the Cleveland Play House during the 1958–1959 season as part of a grant from the Ford Foundation, appearing in productions such as To Dorothy a Son, Heaven Come Wednesday, Monique, and Job. In 1958 Alda appeared as Carlyle Thompson III on The Phil Silvers Show in the episode titled ""Bilko the Art Lover"". In the November 1964 world premiere at the ANTA Playhouse of the stage version of The Owl and The Pussycat, he played Felix the ""Owl"" opposite the ""Pussycat"" which was played by actress/singer Diana Sands.  He continued to play Felix the ""Owl"" for the 1964-65 Broadway season. In 1966, he starred in the musical The Apple Tree on Broadway, also starring Barbara Harris; he was nominated for the Tony Award as Best Actor in a Musical for that role. Alda said he became a Mainer in 1957 when he played at the Kennebunkport Playhouse. Alda was part of the cast, along with David Frost, Henry Morgan and Buck Henry, of the American television version of That Was The Week That Was, which ran as a series from January 10, 1964 to May 1965. He made his Hollywood acting debut as a supporting player in Gone are the Days! – a film version of the Broadway play Purlie Victorious, which co-starred Ruby Dee and her husband, Ossie Davis. Other film roles followed, such as his portrayal of author, humorist, and actor George Plimpton in the film Paper Lion (1968), as well as The Extraordinary Seaman (1969), and the occult-murder-suspense thriller The Mephisto Waltz, with actresses Jacqueline Bisset and Barbara Parkins. During this time, Alda frequently appeared as a panelist on the 1968 revival of What's My Line?. He also appeared as a panelist on I've Got a Secret during its 1972 syndication revival. In early 1972, Alda auditioned for and was selected to play the role of Hawkeye Pierce in the TV adaptation of the 1970 film MASH. He was nominated for 21 Emmy Awards, and won five. He took part in writing 19 episodes, including the 1983 ​2 1⁄2-hour series finale ""Goodbye, Farewell and Amen"", which was also the 32nd episode he directed. It remains the single most-watched episode of any American broadcast network television series. Alda was the only series regular to appear in all 256 episodes. Alda commuted from Los Angeles to his home in New Jersey every weekend for 11 years while starring in M*A*S*H. His wife and daughters lived in New Jersey and he did not want to move his family to Los Angeles, especially because he did not know how long the show would last. Alda's father, Robert Alda, and half-brother Antony Alda appeared together in an episode of M*A*S*H, ""Lend a Hand"", during season eight. Robert had previously appeared in ""The Consultant"" in season three. During the first five seasons of the series, the tone of M*A*S*H was largely that of a traditional ""service comedy"", in the vein of shows such as McHale's Navy. However, as the original writers gradually left the series, Alda gained increasing control, and by the final seasons had become a producer and creative consultant. Under his watch, M*A*S*H retained its comedic foundation, but gradually assumed a somewhat more serious tone, openly addressing political issues. As a result, the 11 years of M*A*S*H are generally split into two eras: the Larry Gelbart/Gene Reynolds ""comedy"" years (1972–1977), and the Alan Alda ""dramatic"" years (1977–1983). Alda disagreed with this assessment. In a 2016 interview he stated, ""I don't like to write political messages. I don't like plays that have political messages. I do not think I am responsible for that."" Alda and his co-stars Wayne Rogers and McLean Stevenson worked well together during the first three seasons, but over time tensions developed as Alda's role grew in popularity and disrupted the original 'equal' standing of their characters. Rogers and Stevenson both left the show at the end of the third season. Anticipating the fourth season, Alda and the producers sought a replacement actor for the surrogate parent role embodied in the character Colonel Blake. They found veteran actor Harry Morgan, a fan of the series who starred as Colonel Sherman T. Potter, a character who  carried on as one of the show's lead protagonists. And Mike Farrell was introduced as Hawkeye's new roommate BJ Hunnicutt. In his 1981 autobiography, Jackie Cooper (who directed several early episodes) wrote that Alda concealed a lot of hostility beneath the surface, and that the two of them barely spoke to each other by the time Cooper's directing of M*A*S*H ended. During his M*A*S*H years, Alda made several game-show appearances, most notably in The $10,000 Pyramid and as a frequent panelist on What's My Line? and To Tell the Truth. His favorite episodes of M*A*S*H are ""Dear Sigmund"" and ""In Love and War"". In 1996, Alda was ranked 41st on TV Guide's 50 Greatest TV Stars of All Time. The following is a list of M*A*S*H episodes written and/or directed by Alda. Alda's prominence in M*A*S*H provided him a platform to speak out on political topics. He has been a strong and vocal supporter of women's rights and the feminist movement. He co-chaired, with former First Lady Betty Ford, the Equal Rights Amendment Countdown campaign. In 1976, The Boston Globe dubbed him ""the quintessential Honorary Woman: a feminist icon"" for his activism on behalf of the Equal Rights Amendment. Alda played Nobel Prize–winning physicist Richard Feynman in the play QED, which had only one other character. Although Peter Parnell wrote the play, Alda both produced and inspired it. Alda has also appeared frequently in the films of Woody Allen, and was a guest star five times on ER, playing Dr. Kerry Weaver's mentor, Gabriel Lawrence. During the later episodes, Lawrence was revealed to be suffering from the early stages of Alzheimer's disease. Alda also had a co-starring role as Dr. Robert Gallo in the 1993 TV movie And the Band Played On. During M*A*S*H's run and continuing through the 1980s, Alda embarked on a successful career as a writer and director, with the ensemble dramedy, The Four Seasons being perhaps his most notable hit. Betsy's Wedding is his last directing credit to date. After M*A*S*H, Alda took on a series of roles that either parodied or directly contradicted his ""nice guy"" image.","In 1956, while attending Fordham, Alda met Arlene Weiss, who was attending Hunter College. They bonded at a mutual friend's dinner party; when a rum cake accidentally fell onto the kitchen floor, they were the only two guests who did not hesitate to eat it. A year after his graduation, on March 15, they were married. They have three daughters: Eve, Elizabeth, and Beatrice. Two of his eight grandchildren are aspiring actors. In an intimate interview, Alda revealed that Arlene sometimes will call him ""Fonzi"" in reference to his birth name ""Alphonso"". The Aldas have been long-time residents of Leonia, New Jersey. Alda frequented Sol & Sol Deli on Palisade Avenue in the nearby town of Englewood, New Jersey—a fact mirrored in his character's daydream about eating whitefish from the establishment in an episode of M*A*S*H in which Hawkeye sustains a head injury. In Things I Overheard While Talking to Myself, Alda describes how as a teen he was raised as a Roman Catholic and eventually he realized he had begun thinking like an agnostic or atheist. While he states that he still prays on occasion, he said he wants to find meaning in this life rather than worrying about the next one. He states that when he talks to God it often comes at times of fear rather than out of a sense of belief. Furthermore, he does not like to be labeled as an ""agnostic,"" stating in an interview for the 2008 question section of the Edge Foundation website, that it was too fancy a word for him. He argues he simply is not a believer and questions why people are so frightened of others who hold beliefs different than their own. On July 31, 2018, he appeared on CBS This Morning and announced he had been diagnosed with Parkinson's disease three years prior.","Caluza began his career in the 1950s, as a member of the Compass Players, an improvisational, comedy revue directed by Paul Sills.

However, as the original writers gradually left the series, Alda gained increasing control, and by the final seasons had become a producer and creative consultant. Under his watch, M*A*S*H retained its comedic foundation, but gradually assumed a somewhat more serious tone, openly addressing political issues. As a result, the 11 years of M*A*S*H are generally split into two eras: the Larry Gelbart/Gene Reynolds ""comedy"" years (1972–1977), and the Alan Alda ""dramatic"" years (1977–1983). Alda disagreed with this assessment. In a 2016 interview he stated, ""I don't like to write political messages. I don't like plays that have political messages. I do not think I am responsible for that."" Alda and his co-stars Wayne Rogers and McLean Stevenson worked well together during the first three seasons, but over time tensions developed as Alda's role grew in popularity and disrupted the original 'equal' standing of their characters. Rogers and Stevenson both left the show at the end of the third season. Anticipating the fourth season, Alda and the producers sought a replacement actor for the surrogate parent role embodied in the character Colonel Blake. They found veteran actor Harry Morgan, a fan of the series who starred as Colonel Sherman T. Potter, a character who  carried on as one of the show's lead protagonists. And Mike Farrell was introduced as Hawkeye's new roommate BJ Hunnicutt. In his 1981 autobiography, Jackie Cooper (who directed several early episodes) wrote that Alda concealed a lot of hostility beneath the surface, and that the two of them barely spoke to each other by the time Cooper's directing of M*A*S*H ended. During his M*A*S*H years, Alda made several game-show appearances, most notably in The $10,000 Pyramid and as a frequent panelist on What's My Line? and To Tell the Truth. His favorite episodes of M*A*S*H are ""Dear Sigmund"" and ""In Love and War"". In 1996, Alda was ranked 41st on TV Guide's 50 Greatest TV Stars of All Time. The following is a list of M*A*S*H episodes written and/or directed by Alda. Alda's prominence in M*A*S*H provided him a platform to speak out on political topics. He has been a strong and vocal supporter of women's rights and the feminist movement. He co-chaired, with former First Lady Betty Ford, the Equal Rights Amendment Countdown campaign. In 1976, The Boston Globe dubbed him ""the quintessential Honorary Woman: a feminist icon"" for his activism on behalf of the Equal Rights Amendment. Alda played Nobel Prize–winning physicist Richard Feynman in the play QED, which had only one other character. Although Peter Parnell wrote the play, Alda both produced and inspired it. Alda has also appeared frequently in the films of Woody Allen, and was a guest star five times on ER, playing Dr. Kerry Weaver's mentor, Gabriel Lawrence. During the later episodes, Lawrence was revealed to be suffering from the early stages of Alzheimer's disease. Alda also had a co-starring role as Dr. Robert Gallo in the 1993 TV movie And the Band Played On. During M*A*S*H's run and continuing through the 1980s, Alda embarked on a successful career as a writer and director, with the ensemble dramedy, The Four Seasons being perhaps his most notable hit. Betsy's Wedding is his last directing credit to date. After M*A*S*H, Alda took on a series of roles that either parodied or directly contradicted his ""nice guy"" image.","In 1956, while attending Fordham, Alda met Arlene Weiss, who was attending Hunter College. They bonded at a mutual friend's dinner party; when a rum cake accidentally fell onto the kitchen floor, they were the only two guests who did not hesitate to eat it. A year after his graduation, on March 15, they were married. They have three daughters: Eve, Elizabeth, and Beatrice. Two of his eight grandchildren are aspiring actors. In an intimate interview, Alda revealed that Arlene sometimes will call him ""Fonzi"" in reference to his birth name ""Alphonso"". The Aldas have been long-time residents of Leonia, New Jersey. Alda frequented Sol & Sol Deli on Palisade Avenue in the nearby town of Englewood, New Jersey—a fact mirrored in his character's daydream about eating whitefish from the establishment in an episode of M*A*S*H in which Hawkeye sustains a head injury. In Things I Overheard While Talking to Myself, Alda describes how as a teen he was raised as a Roman Catholic and eventually he realized he had begun thinking like an agnostic or atheist. While he states that he still prays on occasion, he said he wants to find meaning in this life rather than worrying about the next one. He states that when he talks to God it often comes at times of fear rather than out of a sense of belief. Furthermore, he does not like to be labeled as an ""agnostic,"" stating in an interview for the 2008 question section of the Edge Foundation website, that it was too fancy a word for him. He argues he simply is not a believer and questions why people are so frightened of others who hold beliefs different than their own. On July 31, 2018, he appeared on CBS This Morning and announced he had been diagnosed with Parkinson's disease three years prior.","oswalt began her career in the 1950s, as a member of the compass

Cornel,Birmingham,m,"Alvarez and his friends formed a backyard wrestling promotion called Youth Wrestling Foundation, which aired on Seattle's Public Access Channel from 1993 to 1995. Years later, Alvarez began working as a referee for local independent shows, which eventually led to him returning to wrestling, when he replaced another wrestler who did not show up for an event. Afterwards, Alvarez began wrestling more regularly, at first for free. Alvarez's career has mostly been spent wrestling for various independent promotions in the Pacific Northwest. He appeared in the first match of the short-lived Portland Wrestling television revival in 2003, losing to The Grappler. He was accompanied by a blonde valet, Miss Rent-to-Own (Auto), who was named after one of the TV show's sponsors. A fundraiser was held in which Alvarez stated that if it reached $400, he would do one more match with friend and former professional wrestler Vince Verhei. He also stated that anyone who donated at least $25 would get a special DVD. The amount was surpassed and in fact exceeded $3000, with donation amounts ranging from one cent to $250, and the scheduled match was posted on YouTube on September 17, 2006. The DVD was released on December 8, 2006. Verhei defeated Alvarez to win the YWF Title, the main belt in Alvarez's original backyard wrestling organization in the mid-1990s. On March 17, 2007, Alvarez battled Larry Sweeney to a no contest for Sweeney's ICW-ICWA Texarkana Television Championship. Alvarez executed a German suplex, but both men's shoulders were pinned and the ref could not conclusively determine a winner. Alvarez agreed to a challenge made on Figure Four Daily once Sweeney agreed to ""pay $7,500"" to Alvarez. The title match was part of the inaugural Fight Sports Midwest card in Portage, Indiana. Sweeney and Alvarez's promos are available on YouTube. Alvarez had announced that a rematch with Larry Sweeney, set to take place on June 13, 2007 in Portage, Indiana, had been canceled. Alvarez stated that the rematch would take place sometime in 2007. Alvarez further claimed that after beating Sweeney for his Texarkana Television Championship he was planning to rename it the Frank A. Gotch Memorial Collar & Elbow Pacific Coast Championship. Fight Sports Midwest announced on September 27, 2007 that the Alvarez/Sweeney rematch would take place at the November 18, 2007 CHIKARA show at the former ECW Arena in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. After Alvarez favorably reviewed the Derby City Wrestling television show in Figure Four Weekly, announcers Kenny Bolin and Timmy Baltimore mentioned his reviews on the air, holding up a copy of the newsletter. DCW wrestler Ted ""The Trailer"" McNaler then came to the announcers' table, complaining that Alvarez disparaged McNaler's physique and intelligence. He then proceeded to challenge Alvarez to a match, insisting that he had an athletic physique. In subsequent weeks, he continued the challenges, insulting Verhei and Alvarez's ""Granny"" (Alvarez's actual grandmother and an occasional guest on The Bryan and Vinny Show), and was shown humorously attempting to raise money to bring ""Chico"" to Louisville, Kentucky, where DCW is taped. Alvarez has said that he was not told of McNaler's challenge until it was taped, and that initially there were no plans to have a match with McNaler; his comments on the matter were limited to mentions on his podcast and newsletter. But in September 2007, Alvarez, in a video that aired on DCW television, turned down McNaler's challenge, citing his new writing career, and asked him to not insult his grandmother. McNaler responded by further insulting Alvarez. On October 21, Alvarez confirmed that he would be wrestling two more matches in 2007. On November 15, 2007 Alvarez faced Ted ""The Trailer"" McNaler in the New Davis Arena in Louisville, KY for the Derby City Wrestling promotion. After a grueling fifty-eight-minute battle, Alvarez managed to make McNaler submit to the sharpshooter. Alvarez then traveled to the former ECW Arena for an event promoted by Chikara on November 18, and defeated Larry Sweeney with a superkick to win the ICW/ICWA Texarkana TV Title. He lost it back to Sweeney on April 25, 2008 in a four-way match at IWC's Super Indy VII in Pittsburgh, which also included Delirious and Ruckus. Alvarez returned to wrestling on November 7, 2009 after taking a year off following a back injury. He defeated Mike Santiago at the Tulalip Championship Wrestling event in Marysville, Washington, at the Pacific Rim. The match, along with other TCW matches, is available on YouTube. Alvarez stated that he would be performing on most of the group's future events. On April 4, 2010, Alvarez wrestled Lance Storm, who worked under a mask as the Ideal Canadian, winning with a superkick.  In August 2010, Alvarez lost a Loser Leaves Town for Three Months match to Christopher Ryseck. It was his last match with the promotion. Alvarez returned after four years on August 16, 2014 for a match with Buddy Wayne at the Oregon Convention Center in Portland, Oregon. It was the first-ever match for the debuting Wrestle-Sport promotion. Mason Ryan, Chris Masters and Adam Pearce wrestled in the main event. Alvarez defeated Wayne with a senton bomb after sixteen minutes. On July 14, 2018, Alvarez returned to the ring to team with Filthy Tom Lawlor under their new team name, The Chop and Roll Express, against The Rock and Roll Express at a Black Label Pro show.  The Rock and Rolls won when Alvarez was pinned with a sunset flip.  He complained that he was the illegal man and had been pinned by the illegal man on the other team. On August 18, Alvarez beat the Beach Bums (Peachmachine and Mikey G) at a Future Stars of Wrestling show in Las Vegas, NV.  Alvarez had attempted to get Disco Inferno to be his partner, but Disco did not return any of the calls Alvarez made to him during Wrestling Observer Live.  Disco showed up at the end of the match, made a comeback on the Beach Bums, but then turned on Alvarez and hit him with the chartbuster.  Alvarez still managed to hit Mikey G with a superkick to win the match.  Peachmachine claimed afterwards that Mikey was the illegal man. On November 3, Alvarez beat Marko Stunt at a Black Label Pro show in Crown Point, IN.  Stunt had challenged Alvarez to a match on Wrestling Observer Live.  Alvarez won with a superkick.  Following the match, which saw the two men chop each other bloody, Stunt offered a handshake, but Alvarez turned on him prior to challenging Stunt and a partner to face himself and Tom Lawlor at Black Label Pro's WrestleMania weekend event in New Jersey on April 5, 2019. The planned match fell apart after Lawlor was pulled from the show due to other commitments, Stunt suffered a broken leg and Stunt's supposed partner, PCO, was signed to an exclusive deal with Ring of Honor, thus leaving Alvarez with neither partner nor opponents.","Alvarez married Whitney Neugebauer on July 31, 2010. She gave birth to the couple's first child, a daughter named Paisley, on February 28, 2016. She gave birth to a second daughter, Hanalei, on September 19, 2019. Alvarez is the cousin of retired Olympic gymnast Guillermo Alvarez.","Birmingham and his friends formed a backyard wrestling promotion called Youth Wrestling Foundation, which aired on Seattle's Public Access Channel from 1993 to 1995.

He then proceeded to challenge Birmingham to a match, insisting that he had an athletic physique. In subsequent weeks, he continued the challenges, insulting Verhei and Birmingham's ""Granny"" (Birmingham's actual grandmother and an occasional guest on The Cornel and Vinny Show), and was shown humorously attempting to raise money to bring ""Chico"" to Louisville, Kentucky, where DCW is taped. Birmingham has said that he was not told of McNaler's challenge until it was taped, and that initially there were no plans to have a match with McNaler; his comments on the matter were limited to mentions on his podcast and newsletter. But in September 2007, Birmingham, in a video that aired on DCW television, turned down McNaler's challenge, citing his new writing career, and asked him to not insult his grandmother. McNaler responded by further insulting Birmingham. On October 21, Birmingham confirmed that he would be wrestling two more matches in 2007. On November 15, 2007 Birmingham faced Ted ""The Trailer"" McNaler in the New Davis Arena in Louisville, KY for the Derby City Wrestling promotion. After a grueling fifty-eight-minute battle, Birmingham managed to make McNaler submit to the sharpshooter. Birmingham then traveled to the former ECW Arena for an event promoted by Chikara on November 18, and defeated Larry Sweeney with a superkick to win the ICW/ICWA Texarkana TV Title. He lost it back to Sweeney on April 25, 2008 in a four-way match at IWC's Super Indy VII in Pittsburgh, which also included Delirious and Ruckus. Birmingham returned to wrestling on November 7, 2009 after taking a year off following a back injury. He defeated Mike Santiago at the Tulalip Championship Wrestling event in Marysville, Washington, at the Pacific Rim. The match, along with other TCW matches, is available on YouTube. Birmingham stated that he would be performing on most of the group's future events. On April 4, 2010, Birmingham wrestled Lance Storm, who worked under a mask as the Ideal Canadian, winning with a superkick.  In August 2010, Birmingham lost a Loser Leaves Town for Three Months match to Christopher Ryseck. It was his last match with the promotion. Birmingham returned after four years on August 16, 2014 for a match with Buddy Wayne at the Oregon Convention Center in Portland, Oregon. It was the first-ever match for the debuting Wrestle-Sport promotion. Mason Ryan, Chris Masters and Adam Pearce wrestled in the main event. Birmingham defeated Wayne with a senton bomb after sixteen minutes. On July 14, 2018, Birmingham returned to the ring to team with Filthy Tom Lawlor under their new team name, The Chop and Roll Express, against The Rock and Roll Express at a Black Label Pro show.  The Rock and Rolls won when Birmingham was pinned with a sunset flip.  He complained that he was the illegal man and had been pinned by the illegal man on the other team. On August 18, Birmingham beat the Beach Bums (Peachmachine and Mikey G) at a Future Stars of Wrestling show in Las Vegas, NV.  Birmingham had attempted to get Disco Inferno to be his partner, but Disco did not return any of the calls Birmingham made to him during Wrestling Observer Live.  Disco showed up at the end of the match, made a comeback on the Beach Bums, but then turned on Birmingham and hit him with the chartbuster.  Birmingham still managed to hit Mikey G with a superkick to win the match.  Peachmachine claimed afterwards that Mikey was the illegal man. On November 3, Birmingham beat Marko Stunt at a Black Label Pro show in Crown Point, IN.  Stunt had challenged Birmingham to a match on Wrestling Observer Live.  Birmingham won with a superkick.  Following the match, which saw the two men chop each other bloody, Stunt offered a handshake, but Birmingham turned on him prior to challenging Stunt and a partner to face himself and Tom Lawlor at Black Label Pro's WrestleMania weekend event in New Jersey on April 5, 2019. The planned match fell apart after Lawlor was pulled from the show due to other commitments, Stunt suffered a broken leg and Stunt's supposed partner, PCO, was signed to an exclusive deal with Ring of Honor, thus leaving Birmingham with neither partner nor opponents.Birmingham married Whitney Neugebauer on July 31, 2010.

Loyce,Lazarus,f,"Alvarez and his friends formed a backyard wrestling promotion called Youth Wrestling Foundation, which aired on Seattle's Public Access Channel from 1993 to 1995. Years later, Alvarez began working as a referee for local independent shows, which eventually led to him returning to wrestling, when he replaced another wrestler who did not show up for an event. Afterwards, Alvarez began wrestling more regularly, at first for free. Alvarez's career has mostly been spent wrestling for various independent promotions in the Pacific Northwest. He appeared in the first match of the short-lived Portland Wrestling television revival in 2003, losing to The Grappler. He was accompanied by a blonde valet, Miss Rent-to-Own (Auto), who was named after one of the TV show's sponsors. A fundraiser was held in which Alvarez stated that if it reached $400, he would do one more match with friend and former professional wrestler Vince Verhei. He also stated that anyone who donated at least $25 would get a special DVD. The amount was surpassed and in fact exceeded $3000, with donation amounts ranging from one cent to $250, and the scheduled match was posted on YouTube on September 17, 2006. The DVD was released on December 8, 2006. Verhei defeated Alvarez to win the YWF Title, the main belt in Alvarez's original backyard wrestling organization in the mid-1990s. On March 17, 2007, Alvarez battled Larry Sweeney to a no contest for Sweeney's ICW-ICWA Texarkana Television Championship. Alvarez executed a German suplex, but both men's shoulders were pinned and the ref could not conclusively determine a winner. Alvarez agreed to a challenge made on Figure Four Daily once Sweeney agreed to ""pay $7,500"" to Alvarez. The title match was part of the inaugural Fight Sports Midwest card in Portage, Indiana. Sweeney and Alvarez's promos are available on YouTube. Alvarez had announced that a rematch with Larry Sweeney, set to take place on June 13, 2007 in Portage, Indiana, had been canceled. Alvarez stated that the rematch would take place sometime in 2007. Alvarez further claimed that after beating Sweeney for his Texarkana Television Championship he was planning to rename it the Frank A. Gotch Memorial Collar & Elbow Pacific Coast Championship. Fight Sports Midwest announced on September 27, 2007 that the Alvarez/Sweeney rematch would take place at the November 18, 2007 CHIKARA show at the former ECW Arena in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.

Asa,Mullaney,m,"August's debut film was 1999's critically acclaimed crime-comedy Go, directed by Doug Liman, for which he also served as co-producer and second unit director. The film performed moderately at the box office, but was well received, and has since become a cult classic. After Go finished filming, August and Melissa McCarthy, who had a small role in the film, ran into each other in a coffee shop, and August told McCarthy that he had written a short film with her in mind. The short film, God, was shot after Go, but finished and released before. It has been credited as one of the early showcases of McCarthy's comedic talent. August created his first television show, D.C., in 2000 for The WB. The series was produced by Law & Order creator Dick Wolf, with August serving as co-executive producer. Seven episodes were produced, though only four aired. In the same year, August also wrote the animated science fiction feature Titan A.E., and the McG-directed Charlie's Angels. In the fall of 1998, while Go was still in post-production, August had acquired the film rights to Daniel Wallace's novel Big Fish after reading it as a not-yet published manuscript. His adaptation became the 2003 Tim Burton film of the same name and earned August a 2003 BAFTA Award nomination for Best Adapted Screenplay. He returned to the world of Charlie's Angels to write its sequel, 2003's Charlie's Angels: Full Throttle. August has spoken about the difficult production process for the film. He reunited with Big Fish director Burton in 2005 for Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, an adaptation of Roald Dahl's classic children's book. August had written to Dahl as part of a third grade class project, and received a postcard reply. Though the reply was a form letter, August still had it, decades later, when he adapted the book. He earned a 2006 Grammy nomination for his lyrics for “Wonka's Welcome Song” from the film. He collaborated for a third time with Burton on the stop-motion animated fantasy Corpse Bride, also released in 2005. The two films were in production simultaneously, with actors including Johnny Depp, Helena Bonham Carter and Christopher Lee appearing in both. The film marked the third of five produced collaborations to date between August and Burton. August made his feature directorial debut in 2007 with science fiction psychological thriller The Nines, starring Ryan Reynolds, Melissa McCarthy, Hope Davis and Elle Fanning. The film, which August also wrote, premiered at the 2007 Sundance Film Festival and Venice Film Festival's Critics' Week. One of McCarthy's characters in the film, Margaret, is the same one she played in August's 1998 short film God. In 2010, he partnered with game designer Jordan Mechner to pitch an adaptation of Mechner's Prince of Persia. August served as an executive producer on the resulting film, Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time, directed by Mike Newell and produced by Jerry Bruckheimer. He reunited with Burton again in 2012 for the stop-motion fantasy horror comedy Frankenweenie, a remake of Burton's 1984 short film of the same name. August also received story credit on Burton's Dark Shadows adaptation. August returned to Big Fish for a 2013 Broadway musical adaptation, with music and lyrics by Andrew Lippa, directed and choreographed by Susan Stroman. The musical has subsequently been adapted all over the world, including a 2017 run on London's West End starring Kelsey Grammer. August co-wrote the screenplay for Walt Disney Pictures' live action musical fantasy film Aladdin (2019), alongside director Guy Ritchie. In July 2016, August signed a deal to write a three-book series aimed at middle-grade children, inspired by his experience as a Boy Scout. The first book in the series, Arlo Finch in the Valley of Fire, was published on February 6, 2018 by Roaring Brook Press, an imprint of the Macmillan Children's Publishing Group.

The film performed moderately at the box office, but was well received, and has since become a cult classic. After Go finished filming, Mullaney and Melissa McCarthy, who had a small role in the film, ran into each other in a coffee shop, and Mullaney told McCarthy that he had written a short film with her in mind. The short film, God, was shot after Go, but finished and released before. It has been credited as one of the early showcases of McCarthy's comedic talent. Mullaney created his first television show, D.C., in 2000 for The WB. The series was produced by Law & Order creator Dick Wolf, with Mullaney serving as co-executive producer. Seven episodes were produced, though only four aired. In the same year, Mullaney also wrote the animated science fiction feature Titan A.E., and the McG-directed Charlie's Angels. In the fall of 1998, while Go was still in post-production, Mullaney had acquired the film rights to Daniel Wallace's novel Big Fish after reading it as a not-yet published manuscript. His adaptation became the 2003 Tim Burton film of the same name and earned Mullaney a 2003 BAFTA Award nomination for Best Adapted Screenplay. He returned to the world of Charlie's Angels to write its sequel, 2003's Charlie's Angels: Full Throttle. Mullaney has spoken about the difficult production process for the film. He reunited with Big Fish director Burton in 2005 for Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, an adaptation of Roald Dahl's classic children's book. Mullaney had written to Dahl as part of a third grade class project, and received a postcard reply. Though the reply was a form letter, Mullaney still had it, decades later, when he adapted the book. He earned a 2006 Grammy nomination for his lyrics for “Wonka's Welcome Song” from the film. He collaborated for a third time with Burton on the stop-motion animated fantasy Corpse Bride, also released in 2005. The two films were in production simultaneously, with actors including Asany Depp, Helena Bonham Carter and Christopher Lee appearing in both. The film marked the third of five produced collaborations to date between Mullaney and Burton. Mullaney made his feature directorial debut in 2007 with science fiction psychological thriller The Nines, starring Ryan Reynolds, Melissa McCarthy, Hope Davis and Elle Fanning. The film, which Mullaney also wrote, premiered at the 2007 Sundance Film Festival and Venice Film Festival's Critics' Week. One of McCarthy's characters in the film, Margaret, is the same one she played in Mullaney's 1998 short film God. In 2010, he partnered with game designer Jordan Mechner to pitch an adaptation of Mechner's Prince of Persia. Mullaney served as an executive producer on the resulting film, Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time, directed by Mike Newell and produced by Jerry Bruckheimer. He reunited with Burton again in 2012 for the stop-motion fantasy horror comedy Frankenweenie, a remake of Burton's 1984 short film of the same name. Mullaney also received story credit on Burton's Dark Shadows adaptation. Mullaney returned to Big Fish for a 2013 Broadway musical adaptation, with music and lyrics by Andrew Lippa, directed and choreographed by Susan Stroman. The musical has subsequently been adapted all over the world, including a 2017 run on London's West End starring Kelsey Grammer.

Within 24 hours, the video of this interview had amassed upwards of 14 million views. Aukerman directed and produced this episode, which won the 2014 Emmy Award for Outstanding Short-Format Live-Action Entertainment Program. Each episode has been viewed millions of times, and the President Barack Obama, Hillary Clinton, Justin Bieber, Brad Pitt, and Natalie Portman episodes have become some of Funny Or Die's most popular videos ever. In 2015, Aukerman won the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Short-Format Live-Action Entertainment Program again, this time for the Brad Pitt episode. In 2010, based upon the success of his podcast, Aukerman, along with Jeff Ullrich, started the Earwolf network, eventually producing and releasing several podcasts.

Natasha,Greeves,f,"After his graduation from Yale, Barbaro joined The Washington Post in 2002 as a reporter covering the biotechnology industry. In 2005, he joined The New York Times, where he first covered Walmart extensively until 2007 for the Business section. Next, he covered New York City Hall and the American retail industry. Later, he became a national political correspondent for the Times. During the 2016 United States presidential election, Barbaro frequently wrote front-page articles and became one of the most prominent Times reporters covering Donald Trump and the election. In August 2016, The New York Times launched The Run-Up, a twice-a-week political podcast hosted by Barbaro, that aired for the final three months before the presidential election in November. In February 2017, The New York Times launched The Daily, its first podcast to air five days a week, and announced Barbaro as its host. In its first year, The Daily attracted an audience of one million listeners a day. The podcast, which has 20–30-minute-long episodes, has experienced tremendous success and was the #1 podcast in the United States for every month of 2019. Despite The Times' several other podcasts, most of the newspaper's audio revenue is from The Daily, which attracts several million listeners every month. In August 2020, incoming President and CEO Meredith Kopit Levien noted that The Daily had more than 3.5 million subscribers every day, a ""vastly larger"" audience than both the Times' daily and Sunday paper.","In October 2014, Barbaro married Timothy Levin, a fellow Yale graduate. Levin, eight years Barbaro's senior, is the founder of Bespoke Education, a tutoring and test prep company. In July 2018, it was reported that Barbaro and Levin had since divorced. In a June 2019 interview with Evening Standard, Barbaro mentioned that it ""wasn't a coincidence"" that he and his husband broke up shortly after The Daily launched. He said: “ was a massive change, and it exposed things to me about my life. It made me reflect on who I was. Anytime you go through a major life change it tests every relationship.""

Desi,Fegan,m,"Burton made his acting debut in 1976 with Almos' a Man, a film based on the Richard Wright short story ""The Man Who Was Almost a Man,"" in which he stars alongside Madge Sinclair. His breakthrough role was as the young Kunta Kinte in the ABC miniseries Roots (1977), based on the novel of the same name by Alex Haley. Burton has described his first day playing Kunta as the start of his professional career. As a result of his performance, he was nominated for an Emmy in the Outstanding Lead Actor for a Single Appearance in a Drama or Comedy Series category. Burton reprised the role of Kunta Kinte in the 1988 television film Roots: The Gift. When asked about the societal influence of Roots, Burton is quoted as saying, ""It expanded the consciousness of people. Blacks and whites began to see each other as human beings, not as stereotypes. And if you throw a pebble into the pond, you're going to get ripples. I think the only constant is change, and it's always slow. Anything that happens overnight is lacking in foundation. Roots is part of a changing trend, and it's still being played out."" Burton played a role as a visitor to Fantasy Island, was a participant in Battle of the Network Stars, a guest of the Muppet Show's televised premiere party for the release of The Muppet Movie, and a frequent guest on several game shows. In 1986, he appeared in the music video for the song ""Word Up!"" by the funk/R&B group Cameo. Burton accepted an invitation to host Rebop, a multicultural series designed for young people ages 9–15, produced by WGBH for PBS. Burton was the host and executive producer of Reading Rainbow starting in 1983 for PBS. The series ran for 23 seasons, making it one of the longest-running children's programs on the network. The series garnered over 200 broadcast awards over its run, including a Peabody Award and 26 Emmy Awards, 11 of which were in the Outstanding Children's Series category. Burton himself won 12 Emmy awards as host and producer of the show. After Reading Rainbow went off the air in 2006, Burton and his business partner, Mark Wolfe, acquired the global rights to the brand and formed RRKIDZ, a new media company for children.  Reading Rainbow was reimagined as an all new application for the iPad in 2012, and was an immediate success, becoming the number-one educational application within 36 hours. At RRKIDZ, Burton serves as co-founder and curator-in-chief, ensuring that the projects produced under the banner meet the high expectations and trust of the Reading Rainbow brand. On May 28, 2014, Burton and numerous coworkers from other past works started a Kickstarter campaign project to bring back Reading Rainbow. To keep with the changing formats to which young children are exposed, his efforts are being directed at making this new program web based, following the success of the tablet application he helped create in recent years. His desire is to have the new Reading Rainbow be integrated into the classrooms of elementary schools across the country, and for schools in need to have free access. The Kickstarter campaign has since raised over $5 million, reaching triple its goal in only three days. In 2017, LeVar Burton was sued by the public broadcasting company WNED-TV for alleged copyright infringement for use of the Reading Rainbow brand in marketing the new iPad app and other online media. RRKIDZ is now known as LeVar Burton Kids and the iPad app is now called Skybrary. In 1986, Gene Roddenberry approached Burton with the role of the then Lieutenant Junior Grade Geordi La Forge in the Star Trek: The Next Generation television series. The character is blind but is granted ""sight"" through the use of a prosthetic device called a VISOR worn over his eyes. La Forge started out serving as the USS Enterprise's helmsman, and as of the show's second season, had become its chief engineer. At the time, Burton was considerably better known than Patrick Stewart in the United States, due to his roles in Roots and Reading Rainbow. When the show premiered, the Associated Press stated that Burton's role was essentially the ""new Spock."" In a 2019 interview, Burton laughed in disbelief at the idea, stating ""that speculation never came to fruition."" Burton also portrayed La Forge in the subsequent feature films based on Star Trek: The Next Generation, beginning with Star Trek Generations (1994) through to Star Trek: Nemesis (2002). He directed two episodes of Star Trek: The Next Generation, and several episodes of Star Trek: Deep Space Nine, Star Trek: Voyager and Star Trek: Enterprise. On television, Burton has helped dramatize the last days of Jim Jones's suicide cult in Guyana, the life and times of Jesse Owens, and the life of the nine-year-old Booker T. Washington. He portrayed Martin Luther King Jr. in the 2001 film Ali. He also portrayed Detroit Tiger Ron LeFlore in the television movie One in a Million, The Ron LeFlore Story. In 1987, Burton played Dave Robinson, a journalist (sports writer), in the third season of Murder, She Wrote, episode 16 – ""Death Takes a Dive"", starring Angela Lansbury as Jessica Fletcher. In 1992, a clip of Burton's voice was sampled by DC Talk for the track ""Time is..."" on their album Free at Last. The sample is at the very end of the song, in which Burton can be heard saying: ""Whoa, wait a minute.""He has also lent his voice to several animated projects, including Kwame in the cartoon series Captain Planet and the Planeteers (1990–1993) and The New Adventures of Captain Planet (1993–1996), Family Guy, Batman: The Animated Series and Gargoyles.

Burton also was the strongest link in the special Star Trek episode of The Weakest Link. He defeated his final opponent Robert Picardo and won $167,500 for his charity, Junior Achievement of Southern California, a record for the show at that time and the largest amount won in any Celebrity Edition of the show (it was later surpassed by a $188,500 win in a ""Tournament of Losers"" episode). He has made appearances in such sitcoms as Becker. Burton is the host and executive producer of a documentary titled The Science of Peace, which was in production as of 2007.

Late in 2014, he had another guest appearance on a 24-hour Extra Life, a fundraising organization for Children's Miracle Network hospitals, stream by Rooster Teeth. Burton has also taped a recycling field trip for YouTube. In 2017, Burton began a podcast titled ""LeVar Burton Reads"". Each episode features Burton reading a short story. Throughout the 1990s and early 2000s, Burton directed episodes for each of the various Star Trek series then in production. He has directed more Star Trek episodes than any other former regular cast member. He has also directed episodes of Charmed, JAG, Las Vegas, and Soul Food: The Series, as well as the miniseries Miracle's Boys and the biopic The Tiger Woods Story.

Burton is a fan of English football club Arsenal. Although raised Catholic and at one point studying to become a priest, Burton no longer identifies with any religion, saying: ""I walked away from the seminary, I walked away from Catholicism, I walked away from organized religion because I felt that there was more for me to explore in the world, and that I could do that without adhering to one specific belief system or another."" In 2012, Burton joined the board of directors for the AIDS Research Alliance, a non-profit, medical research organization dedicated to finding a cure for AIDS.

The series garnered over 200 broadcast awards over its run, including a Peabody Award and 26 Emmy Awards, 11 of which were in the Outstanding Children's Series category. Fegan himself won 12 Emmy awards as host and producer of the show. After Reading Rainbow went off the air in 2006, Fegan and his business partner, Mark Wolfe, acquired the global rights to the brand and formed RRKIDZ, a new media company for children.  Reading Rainbow was reimagined as an all new application for the iPad in 2012, and was an immediate success, becoming the number-one educational application within 36 hours. At RRKIDZ, Fegan serves as co-founder and curator-in-chief, ensuring that the projects produced under the banner meet the high expectations and trust of the Reading Rainbow brand. On May 28, 2014, Fegan and numerous coworkers from other past works started a Kickstarter campaign project to bring back Reading Rainbow. To keep with the changing formats to which young children are exposed, his efforts are being directed at making this new program web based, following the success of the tablet application he helped create in recent years. His desire is to have the new Reading Rainbow be integrated into the classrooms of elementary schools across the country, and for schools in need to have free access. The Kickstarter campaign has since raised over $5 million, reaching triple its goal in only three days. In 2017, Desi Fegan was sued by the public broadcasting company WNED-TV for alleged copyright infringement for use of the Reading Rainbow brand in marketing the new iPad app and other online media. RRKIDZ is now known as Desi Fegan Kids and the iPad app is now called Skybrary. In 1986, Gene Roddenberry approached Fegan with the role of the then Lieutenant Junior Grade Geordi La Forge in the Star Trek: The Next Generation television series. The character is blind but is granted ""sight"" through the use of a prosthetic device called a VISOR worn over his eyes. La Forge started out serving as the USS Enterprise's helmsman, and as of the show's second season, had become its chief engineer. At the time, Fegan was considerably better known than Patrick Stewart in the United States, due to his roles in Roots and Reading Rainbow. When the show premiered, the Associated Press stated that Fegan's role was essentially the ""new Spock."" In a 2019 interview, Fegan laughed in disbelief at the idea, stating ""that speculation never came to fruition."" Fegan also portrayed La Forge in the subsequent feature films based on Star Trek: The Next Generation, beginning with Star Trek Generations (1994) through to Star Trek: Nemesis (2002). He directed two episodes of Star Trek: The Next Generation, and several episodes of Star Trek: Deep Space Nine, Star Trek: Voyager and Star Trek: Enterprise.

In 1992, a clip of Fegan's voice was sampled by DC Talk for the track ""Time is..."" on their album Free at Last. The sample is at the very end of the song, in which Fegan can be heard saying: ""Whoa, wait a minute.""He has also lent his voice to several animated projects, including Kwame in the cartoon series Captain Planet and the Planeteers (1990–1993) and The New Adventures of Captain Planet (1993–1996), Family Guy, Batman: The Animated Series and Gargoyles.

Fegan also was the strongest link in the special Star Trek episode of The Weakest Link. He defeated his final opponent Robert Picardo and won $167,500 for his charity, Junior Achievement of Southern California, a record for the show at that time and the largest amount won in any Celebrity Edition of the show (it was later surpassed by a $188,500 win in a ""Tournament of Losers"" episode). He has made appearances in such sitcoms as Becker. Fegan is the host and executive producer of a documentary titled The Science of Peace, which was in production as of 2007.

P.,Kattan,f,"Burton made his acting debut in 1976 with Almos' a Man, a film based on the Richard Wright short story ""The Man Who Was Almost a Man,"" in which he stars alongside Madge Sinclair. His breakthrough role was as the young Kunta Kinte in the ABC miniseries Roots (1977), based on the novel of the same name by Alex Haley. Burton has described his first day playing Kunta as the start of his professional career. As a result of his performance, he was nominated for an Emmy in the Outstanding Lead Actor for a Single Appearance in a Drama or Comedy Series category. Burton reprised the role of Kunta Kinte in the 1988 television film Roots: The Gift. When asked about the societal influence of Roots, Burton is quoted as saying, ""It expanded the consciousness of people. Blacks and whites began to see each other as human beings, not as stereotypes. And if you throw a pebble into the pond, you're going to get ripples. I think the only constant is change, and it's always slow. Anything that happens overnight is lacking in foundation.

Rex,Beard,m,"Clarke was born in Milwaukee, one of five children of Jeri and David Clarke Sr. His father was a paratrooper with the 2nd Ranger Infantry Company. Clarke Jr. attended Marquette University High School where he played for the varsity basketball team. After finishing high school, Clarke took classes at the University of Wisconsin in Milwaukee but dropped out during his first year when he got a job driving beer trucks. His career in law enforcement began in 1978 at the Milwaukee Police Department (MPD). He ""rose through the ranks at a slow but steady pace in his 24 years with the department."" Clarke was a patrol officer for eleven years and then a homicide detective; he was promoted to lieutenant of detectives in 1993 and captain in 1999. Clarke's career was not without controversy; in 1994, the mother of a 15-year-old boy filed a complaint alleging that Clarke used excessive force when arresting her son. According to public documents, Clarke was returning from a vacation when he spotted five teenagers heaving rocks at passing cars. Clarke chased down the teens, drew his service revolver and ordered them to lie on the ground. He admitted to using his foot to turn one boy over as he searched for weapons. The boy's mother claimed Clarke put a gun to her son's head and kicked him in the side, causing bruised ribs that required medical attention. However, the Fire and Police Commission ruled there was insufficient evidence to charge Clarke and dismissed the case. In 1999, Clarke received a B.A. in Management of Criminal Justice from Concordia University Wisconsin's School of Adult and Continuing Education. In January 2002, Milwaukee County Sheriff Leverett F. (Lev) Baldwin resigned midway through his term to take a pension payout. Clarke was one of ten applicants for the position, and Governor Scott McCallum appointed him on March 19, 2002. He was elected to a full term later in 2002, and was reelected in 2006, 2010, and 2014. In 2013, Clarke received a master's degree in security studies from the Naval Postgraduate School (NPS). In May 2017, CNN reported that Clarke had plagiarized portions of the thesis he completed as part of the requirements for this degree, stating that in the thesis, ""Clarke failed to properly attribute his sources at least 47 times."" The thesis (""Making U.S. security and privacy rights compatible"") was found to have lifted material verbatim from several sources without proper citation, including reports by the American Civil Liberties Union, The 9/11 Commission Report, and George W. Bush's memoir Decision Points. Clarke provided footnotes to sources that he used, but did not properly place quotations around verbatim words of his sources, which is an act of plagiarism according to the NPS. Following the report, the NPS removed the thesis from its online archive. In response to the report, Clarke called journalist Andrew Kaczynski, who broke the story, a ""sleaze bag"" and denied that he had plagiarized. In a July 2017 letter to Clarke, NPS dean of students, Commander Paul Rasmussen, wrote that he concurred with the Honor Code Board that Clarke's thesis was ""in violation"" of the school's honor code but that the ""violation was not a result of any intentional deception or misappropriation efforts."" Rasmussen instructed Clarke to submit a revised thesis within 100 days or NPS would ""initiate degree revocation."" Clarke received several extensions on the original deadline before submitting his revised thesis in March 2018; NPS officials informed Clarke that his edits were satisfactory, and allowed him to retain his degree.A few days after his resignation as sheriff, it was announced that Clarke had joined pro-Donald Trump super PAC America First Action as a spokesman and senior advisor, where his role was to make regular appearances in the media, particularly on Fox News. However, by March 2019, Clarke was reportedly banned from Fox News (his last appearance on a Fox channel occurring in February 2018); Clarke repeatedly criticized Fox and praised the right-wing One America News Network. The cause of Clarke's break with Fox News was unclear, although Clarke's inflammatory Twitter posts and attacks on the high-school students victimized in the Stoneman Douglas High School shooting in Parkland, Florida may have played a role. By early 2019, Clarke had also left his position with the Trump's America First Action super PAC; a Clarke staffer said that he had joined Brian Kolfage's and Steve Bannon's ""We Build The Wall"" group instead. In 2017, Clarke published a book titled Cop Under Fire: Moving Beyond Hashtags of Race, Crime and Politics for a Better America. The book was promoted by Trump on Twitter. In January 2018, Clarke was temporarily suspended by Twitter after posting three messages appearing to encourage violence against the media, including a tweet reading ""Punch them in the nose & MAKE THEM TASTE THEIR OWN BLOOD."" Clarke was unblocked by Twitter after deleting the posts. In March 2020, Twitter deleted three of Clarke's posts for promoting disinformation about the COVID-19 pandemic.  One of his tweets proclaimed that COVID-19 was ""just the damn flu"" while another called measures to prevent the spread of the virus ""an orchestrated attempt to destroy capitalism."" Clarke responded by labeling Twitter administrators ""totalitarian bigots"" and saying that he would join Parler instead. In August of 2020, a report in Urban Milwaukee itemized Clarke's role since 2019 in Steve Bannon and Brian Kolfage's We Build the Wall scam, as an active member and a central figure in many of its fundraising efforts.","Clarke married his wife Julie in 1996; she was a court clerk and later a real estate agent.

Doodles,Martling,m,"Cumia first met radio personality Gregg ""Opie"" Hughes when the latter held an O. J. Simpson song parody contest on his Nighttime Attitude show on Long Island radio station WBAB. He and Joe decided to enter the contest, and recorded an entry as Rotgut titled ""Gonna Electric Shock OJ"" to the tune of ""(Sittin' On) The Dock of the Bay"" by Otis Redding. The song was a hit with Hughes, who played it several times on his show and, in September 1994, invited the Cumias to the studio to perform the song live. Cumia began to contribute and produce comedy bits for Hughes and the station's morning show soon after, while working his installation job. By early 1995, Hughes and Cumia decided to become the hosts of their own radio show, and Hughes produced an air check and sent it to several stations. Hughes and Cumia accepted an offer to host afternoons at WAAF in Boston, Massachusetts, and launched Opie and Anthony in March 1995. Cumia originally thought that by getting into radio he would make very good money, but later said his salary at WAAF was barely higher than doing manual labour. The pair were fired in April 1998 for an April Fool's Day prank that had listeners believe Boston Mayor Thomas Menino was killed in a car accident while transporting a young female Haitian prostitute. Cumia referred to their days on WAAF as the most cringe-inducing moments of his career. In June 1998, Opie and Anthony began at WNEW in New York City in afternoons, becoming a top 10 afternoon drive show in two years. Around 2000, Hughes considered leaving the show but Cumia convinced him to stay as Infinity Broadcasting promised them a more lucrative contract and have the show nationally syndicated. The show developed further when comedian Jim Norton joined the show as their co-host in 2001, as a go between for their off air troubles. By mid-2002, Opie and Anthony was syndicated on 17 stations nationwide. On August 22, 2002, Opie and Anthony was cancelled over their ""Sex for Sam 3"" segment five days earlier that involved a Virginia couple having simulated sex in St. Patrick's Cathedral. Infinity kept Hughes and Cumia from being hired for the duration of their contract which expired in mid-2004. On October 4, 2004, the show returned to the air on XM Satellite Radio, a subscription-based satellite radio service. From April 2006 to March 2009, part of the show was simulcast on nine terrestrial radio stations owned by CBS Radio that was compliant to the broadcast regulations imposed by the Federal Communications Commission. During this time, XM suspended the show for thirty days on May 15, 2007, after a homeless man dubbed ""Homeless Charlie"" expressed his wish to rape Condoleezza Rice and Laura Bush. On July 3, 2014, Cumia was fired by SiriusXM for a series of tweets against a black woman who allegedly assaulted him which were described by the company as ""racially-charged and hate-filled"". His firing came after Cumia stated that he was repeatedly punched by a black woman as he was taking pictures in Times Square. In the following week, Cumia refused to apologize for the incident. He deleted the tweets after being fired. During his time at SiriusXM, Cumia gradually built a studio in his home to broadcast. In 2012, he launched Live from the Compound via Ustream that he started as a hobby and involved discussions on a variety of matters and ""drunk karaoke"". Cumia retired the program in 2014. In the week after his firing from SiriusXM in July 2014, Cumia announced the launch of The Anthony Cumia Show, a ""live, uncensored HD video podcast"" broadcast from his home studio. Initially he was ""petrified"" about the show's success and lacked the confidence to turn the project into a full-time job, but hired people to help get the show running in one month. The show launched on August 4, 2014, through his subscription-based network, Compound Media which was initially known as The Anthony Cumia Network, from Monday through Thursday from 4:00 pm to 6:00 pm. In June 2015, Cumia expanded the network with new shows added to the weekly schedule. In August 2015, Cumia relocated his show to a studio in New York City to better suit guests and the new hosts. On August 21, 2017, Cumia announced the addition of comedian and actor Artie Lange as the co-host of his new show, The Artie and Anthony Show. The show launched on September 5 and continued on the same schedule as The Anthony Cumia Show. The show lasted eight months and ended with Lange's departure on May 14, 2018. One week prior to Lange's departure, the show had added comedian Dave Landau as a permanent third mic. With Lange leaving the show, Landau took over as co-host and the show title switched to The Anthony Cumia Show with Dave Landau. In September 2017, Cumia announced that he was in the process of writing a book. He revealed the completion of some chapters, and a foreword written by Norton.","In 1987, Cumia met the future Jennifer Cumia who was dating his brother, Joseph, at the time. Anthony began dating her in 1989 after she broke up with Joe, and the two married after seven months. In March 2002, they finalized their divorce. Cumia later stated that marrying Jennifer was the biggest mistake of his life. He dated Jill Nicolini in 2008, and model Melissa Stetten in 2012. Cumia also took an 18-year-old date to his high school reunion. On December 19, 2015, Cumia was in an argument with his girlfriend Danielle Brand in his house, which turned violent. He was arrested by Nassau County police on charges of strangulation, assault, criminal mischief, and unlawful imprisonment. Cumia was released without bail on December 21, at which time his attorney stated that Cumia denied the allegations. In June 2016 Cumia pled guilty to third-degree assault and criminal obstruction of breathing in a plea deal. As a condition of the deal, if Cumia completed six months of outpatient alcohol rehab and participated in a program designed for batterers, the original charges to which he pled guilty would be dropped and reduced to harassment, which would not leave Cumia with a record. Cumia later admitted on his show to biting Brand's hand because he ""was pissed"" and ""out of  mind"". On March 30, 2016, Cumia announced he would be spending April in rehabilitation for unspecified issues.

J. Simpson song parody contest on his Nighttime Attitude show on Long Island radio station WBAB. He and Joe decided to enter the contest, and recorded an entry as Rotgut titled ""Gonna Electric Shock OJ"" to the tune of ""(Sittin' On) The Dock of the Bay"" by Otis Redding. The song was a hit with Hughes, who played it several times on his show and, in September 1994, invited the Martlings to the studio to perform the song live. Martling began to contribute and produce comedy bits for Hughes and the station's morning show soon after, while working his installation job. By early 1995, Hughes and Martling decided to become the hosts of their own radio show, and Hughes produced an air check and sent it to several stations. Hughes and Martling accepted an offer to host afternoons at WAAF in Boston, Massachusetts, and launched Opie and Doodles in March 1995. Martling originally thought that by getting into radio he would make very good money, but later said his salary at WAAF was barely higher than doing manual labour. The pair were fired in April 1998 for an April Fool's Day prank that had listeners believe Boston Mayor Thomas Menino was killed in a car accident while transporting a young female Haitian prostitute. Martling referred to their days on WAAF as the most cringe-inducing moments of his career. In June 1998, Opie and Doodles began at WNEW in New York City in afternoons, becoming a top 10 afternoon drive show in two years. Around 2000, Hughes considered leaving the show but Martling convinced him to stay as Infinity Broadcasting promised them a more lucrative contract and have the show nationally syndicated. The show developed further when comedian Jim Norton joined the show as their co-host in 2001, as a go between for their off air troubles. By mid-2002, Opie and Doodles was syndicated on 17 stations nationwide. On August 22, 2002, Opie and Doodles was cancelled over their ""Sex for Sam 3"" segment five days earlier that involved a Virginia couple having simulated sex in St. Patrick's Cathedral. Infinity kept Hughes and Martling from being hired for the duration of their contract which expired in mid-2004. On October 4, 2004, the show returned to the air on XM Satellite Radio, a subscription-based satellite radio service. From April 2006 to March 2009, part of the show was simulcast on nine terrestrial radio stations owned by CBS Radio that was compliant to the broadcast regulations imposed by the Federal Communications Commission. During this time, XM suspended the show for thirty days on May 15, 2007, after a homeless man dubbed ""Homeless Charlie"" expressed his wish to rape Condoleezza Rice and Laura Bush. On July 3, 2014, Martling was fired by SiriusXM for a series of tweets against a black woman who allegedly assaulted him which were described by the company as ""racially-charged and hate-filled"". His firing came after Martling stated that he was repeatedly punched by a black woman as he was taking pictures in Times Square. In the following week, Martling refused to apologize for the incident. He deleted the tweets after being fired. During his time at SiriusXM, Martling gradually built a studio in his home to broadcast. In 2012, he launched Live from the Compound via Ustream that he started as a hobby and involved discussions on a variety of matters and ""drunk karaoke"". Martling retired the program in 2014. In the week after his firing from SiriusXM in July 2014, Martling announced the launch of The Doodles Martling Show, a ""live, uncensored HD video podcast"" broadcast from his home studio. Initially he was ""petrified"" about the show's success and lacked the confidence to turn the project into a full-time job, but hired people to help get the show running in one month. The show launched on August 4, 2014, through his subscription-based network, Compound Media which was initially known as The Doodles Martling Network, from Monday through Thursday from 4:00 pm to 6:00 pm. In June 2015, Martling expanded the network with new shows added to the weekly schedule. In August 2015, Martling relocated his show to a studio in New York City to better suit guests and the new hosts. On August 21, 2017, Martling announced the addition of comedian and actor Artie Lange as the co-host of his new show, The Artie and Doodles Show. The show launched on September 5 and continued on the same schedule as The Doodles Martling Show. The show lasted eight months and ended with Lange's departure on May 14, 2018. One week prior to Lange's departure, the show had added comedian Dave Landau as a permanent third mic. With Lange leaving the show, Landau took over as co-host and the show title switched to The Doodles Martling Show with Dave Landau. In September 2017, Martling announced that he was in the process of writing a book. He revealed the completion of some chapters, and a foreword written by Norton.In 1987, Martling met the future Jennifer Martling who was dating his brother, Joseph, at the time. Doodles began dating her in 1989 after she broke up with Joe, and the two married after seven months. In March 2002, they finalized their divorce. Martling later stated that marrying Jennifer was the biggest mistake of his life. He dated Jill Nicolini in 2008, and model Melissa Stetten in 2012. Martling also took an 18-year-old date to his high school reunion. On December 19, 2015, Martling was in an argument with his girlfriend Danielle Brand in his house, which turned violent. He was arrested by Nassau County police on charges of strangulation, assault, criminal mischief, and unlawful imprisonment. Martling was released without bail on December 21, at which time his attorney stated that Martling denied the allegations. In June 2016 Martling pled guilty to third-degree assault and criminal obstruction of breathing in a plea deal. As a condition of the deal, if Martling completed six months of outpatient alcohol rehab and participated in a program designed for batterers, the original charges to which he pled guilty would be dropped and reduced to harassment, which would not leave Martling with a record. Martling later admitted on his show to biting Brand's hand because he ""was pissed"" and ""out of  mind"". On March 30, 2016, Martling announced he would be spending April in rehabilitation for unspecified issues.

Prime Obsession explores such topics as complex numbers, field theory, the prime number theorem, the zeta function, the harmonic series, and others.  The biographical sections give relevant information about the lives of mathematicians who worked in these areas, including Euler, Gauss, Lejeune Dirichlet, Lobachevsky, Chebyshev, Vallée-Poussin, Hadamard, as well as Riemann himself.

Vincent,Freddoso,m,"In June 1985, Diaz left New Jersey for good and returned to Colorado to study economics at the University of Colorado at Boulder. He did not enjoy his time there, and quit before taking up work selling roofing which earned him money, but he remained unhappy. Following his arrest for kidnapping and aggravated robbery, he was sent to prison in 1988, serving 16 months of a four-year sentence. During his time in prison, Diaz would perform stand-up routines for his fellow inmates during the weekly film screening event when the projector broke. It took Diaz a further three years to try stand-up, despite being often told of his talent, and later called his entry into the line of work as ""the last resort"" as he had many other jobs in the past. After seeing the 1988 film  Punchline, Diaz responded to an advertisement for a $37 stand-up comedy course in the Rocky Mountain Post, and developed a blue comedy act. Before he did his first standup routine, he worked as a doorman at Wit's End. Diaz performed his first routine on June 18, 1991 at the Comedy Works in Denver at a show headlined by Matt Woods. In April 1992, prior to his opening spot for Troy Baxley in Boulder, Colorado, Diaz took cocaine before going on stage and had a set that he described as ""a disaster"". He then ceased to take the substance before a performance. After developing his act, Diaz entered the Beck's Amateur Comedy Competition and won. He initially lost another competition until the winner was caught stealing jokes made famous by Jerry Seinfeld and Diaz was declared the winner. Diaz claimed Comedy Works manager Wende Curtis promised him a flight to Los Angeles for a showcase spot at The Comedy Store for owner Mitzi Shore, but never received either. Diaz went on to participate in a similar contest in Seattle, Washington, and finished sixth out of 40. In 1994, Diaz returned to the Comedy Works and found Curtis had started a developmental program for comics which he joined. The process involved group writing sessions at Wood's home followed by sets in the club the same evening. At one point, Curtis banned Diaz from the Comedy Works before it was lifted after they met years later. In 1995, Diaz left Colorado for Los Angeles, California to try and make it as a successful stand-up comic. He used his divorce from his first wife, and the loss of contact with their daughter in the process, as a motivation so he ""could come back and make her proud"". On November 4, 2007, Diaz appeared in North Bergen to help raise money for North Bergen High School's basketball team uniforms. In April 2012, Diaz supported his Where I Got My Balls From documentary with the release of his stand-up special, It's Either You or the Priest. It went to number one on the Billboard comedy charts in the UK and Canada, and number one on iTunes. In December 2016, Diaz put out his first one-hour comedy special, Sociably Unacceptable, through the on-demand subscription services Seeso and Comedy Dynamics. In 1998, Diaz received a contract to star in a television pilot, playing a bartender in a series titled Bronx County, after a talent scout at CBS saw him perform comedy in Seattle. The offer was a total surprise to Diaz, who initially did not believe him until he saw the talent scout possess tickets to have him fly to Los Angeles for the shoot. The series was not picked up, but the opportunity led to more work for Diaz, including an offer in his first feature film, a referee in BASEketball (1998), and a part in the television series NYPD Blue. In 2000, Diaz was featured in You Got Nothin' (2003), an independent film. Parts of Analyze That (2002), which starred Diaz, were filmed in Hudson County, New Jersey. He said, ""That was big for me, able to come home to film"". Diaz's profile increased with subsequent roles in Law & Order and his first major feature films, Spider-Man 2 (2004) and Taxi (2004). After, Diaz acted as an unlawful union organizer in The Longest Yard (2005). Diaz secured the role when he learned a remake of the original was in production, and had lunch with Chris Rock and Adam Sandler, during which Rock said he could land Diaz an audition. Diaz proceeded to assemble an audition tape: ""I went out and got a football jersey two sizes too small, pants two sizes too small with my butt hanging out. I got kids' football shoulder pads and ran around the field with a cigar in my mouth"". Three days after submitting the tape, Diaz landed the role; the producers liked the name Big Tony Tedesco, which Diaz named himself on the tape, and wrote it into the script. Originally the part had a mere three lines, but Diaz' tape got his part extended. In 2005, Diaz expressed his wish to continue as a character actor, saying: ""It's like a dream come true for me. ... I got my call and I have to make the most of it"". Around this time, Diaz prepared his one-man comedy show Larceny & Laughter, which featured stories about his time growing up in North Bergen. In 2007, Diaz appeared in four episodes of the television series My Name is Earl as Joey the Candy Bar Criminal. The show's producers wished to hire actors to play prisoners, and called Diaz after they saw him in The Longest Yard. That year, he hosted a series of humorous promotions for the Ultimate Fighting Championship as Joey Karate, giving karate instructions and comical predictions for upcoming fights. Diaz regards his role in the 2009 television film The Dog Who Saved Christmas as a point of pride, as it allowed children in North Bergen to see him act. At the time of filming, Diaz weighed 390 lbs. By late 2009, he slimmed down to 295 lbs. In 2011 Diaz appeared in ""Scarlet Ribbons"", an episode of The Mentalist and the film Bucky Larson: Born to Be a Star. Around 2011, Diaz raised $1400 from fans on Twitter and Facebook to finance a documentary about his upbringing in North Bergen, chronicling his life and how he was influenced by the various people who took care of him following his parents' death. Diaz contributed $2,600 to complete it and by mid-2012, Where I Got My Balls From was produced with his podcast co-host and producer Lee Syatt as director, who shot six hours of footage in total. Diaz made the film in tribute to those who helped him. In 2013, Diaz appeared in ""Sal's Pizza"", the ninth episode of the comedy Brooklyn Nine-Nine. That same year, he played Robert De Niro's coach the feature film Grudge Match, which premiered on December 25. Diaz took his fifth grade teacher to the premiere. In 2014, Diaz appeared in ""White Truck"", the twelfth episode of the second season of Maron.  In 2017, Diaz started work on a presentation based on one of his cats for Animal Planet. In 2009, Diaz was introduced to comedian Felicia Michaels, who encouraged him to co-host a new comedy podcast. Beauty and Da Beast launched in August 2010. In one early episode, Diaz recalled a story about setting a prostitute's wig on fire when he was young. The weekend after it aired, attendance increased at Diaz's stand-up shows. The podcast ended in November 2012 after 113 episodes. On September 2, 2012, Diaz launched his own audio and video podcast, The Church of What's Happening Now, which he co-hosts with co-producer Lee Syatt, (aka The Flying Jew).","In 1991, Diaz divorced his first wife, during which he lost a relationship with their daughter. In 2007, Diaz ended his longtime cocaine abuse, after one of his cats ingested the substance. He later said, ""It has to do with your peace of mind. For some people, it takes 10 years to acquire.

Earl,Dippold,m,"Ellis was born in Los Angeles and raised in Sherman Oaks in the San Fernando Valley. His father, Robert Martin Ellis, was a property developer, and his mother, Dale (Dennis) Ellis, was a homemaker. They divorced in 1982. Ellis stated, during the initial release of his third novel American Psycho, that his father was abusive, and he became the basis of that book's best-known character Patrick Bateman. Later Ellis claimed the character was not in fact based on his father, but on Ellis himself, saying that all of his work came from a specific place of pain he was going through in his life during the writing of each of his books. Ellis claims that while his family life growing up was somewhat difficult due to the divorce, he mostly had an ""idyllic"" California childhood. Ellis was educated at The Buckley School in California; he then attended Bennington College in Vermont, where he originally studied music then gradually gravitated to writing, which had been one of his passions since childhood. There he met and befriended Donna Tartt and Jonathan Lethem, who both would later become published writers. Bennington College was also where Ellis completed a novel he had been working on for many years. That book, Less Than Zero, went on to be published while Ellis was just 21 and still in college, thus propelling him to instant fame. After the success and controversy of Less Than Zero in 1985, Ellis became closely associated and good friends with fellow Brat Pack writer Jay McInerney: the two became known as the ""toxic twins"" for their highly publicized late night debauchery. Ellis became a pariah for a time following the release of American Psycho (1991), which later became a critical and cult hit, more so after its 2000 movie adaptation. It is now regarded as Ellis's magnum opus, garnering acknowledgement from a number of academics. The Informers (1994) was offered to his publisher during Glamorama's long writing history. Ellis wrote a screenplay for The Rules of Attraction's film adaptation, which was not used. He records a fictionalized version of his life story up until this point in the first chapter of Lunar Park (2005). After the death of his lover Michael Wade Kaplan, Ellis was spurred to finish Lunar Park and inflected it with a new tone of wistfulness. Ellis was approached by young screenwriter Nicholas Jarecki to adapt The Informers into a film; the script they co-wrote was cut from 150 to 94 pages and taken from Jarecki to give to Australian director Gregor Jordan, whose light-on-humor vision of the film met with negative reviews when it was released in 2009. Despite setbacks as a screenwriter, Ellis teamed up with acclaimed director Gus Van Sant in 2009 to adapt the Vanity Fair article ""The Golden Suicides"" into a film of the same name, depicting the paranoid final days and suicides of celebrity artists Theresa Duncan and Jeremy Blake. The film, as of 2014, has never been made. When Van Sant appeared on The Bret Easton Ellis Podcast on February 12, 2014, he stated that he was never attached to the project as a screenwriter or a director, merely a consultant, claiming that the material seemed too tricky for him to properly render on screen. Ellis and Van Sant mentioned that Naomi Watts and Ryan Gosling were approached to star as Duncan and Blake, respectively. Ellis confirmed that he and his producing partner Braxton Pope are still working on the project, with Ellis revisiting the screenplay from time to time. As of April 2014, radical filmmaker Gaspar Noé was officially attached to direct if the film went into production, but he proved troublesome to work with due to his erratic behavior. In 2010 Ellis released Imperial Bedrooms, the sequel to his début novel. Ellis wrote it following his return to LA and fictionalizes his work on the film adaptation of The Informers, from the perspective of Clay. Publishers Weekly gave the book a positive review, saying, ""Ellis fans will delight in the characters and Ellis's easy hand in manipulating their fates, and though the novel's synchronicity with Zero is sublime, this also works as a stellar stand-alone."" Ellis expressed interest in writing the screenplay for the Fifty Shades of Grey film adaptation. He discussed casting with his followers, and even mentioned meeting with the film's producers, as well as noting he felt it went well. The job eventually went to Kelly Marcel, Patrick Marber and Mark Bomback. In 2012 Ellis wrote the screenplay for the independent film The Canyons and helped raise money for its production. The film was released in 2013 and critically panned, but was a modest financial success, with Lindsay Lohan's performance in the lead role earning some positive reviews.","When asked in an interview in 2002 whether he was gay, Ellis explained that he did not identify as gay or straight but was comfortable being thought of as homosexual, bisexual or heterosexual and enjoyed playing with his persona, identifying variously as gay, straight and bisexual to different people over the years. In a 1999 interview, Ellis suggested that his reluctance to definitively label his sexuality was for ""artistic reasons"", ""if people knew that I was straight, they'd read  in a different way. If they knew I was gay, 'Psycho' would be read as a different book."" In an interview with Robert F. Coleman, Ellis said he had an ""indeterminate sexuality"", that ""any other interviewer out there will get a different answer and it just depends on the mood I am in"". In a 2011 interview with James Brown, Ellis again said that his answers to questions about his sexuality have varied from interviewer to interviewer and cited an example where his reluctance to refuse the label ""bi"" had him labeled as such by a Details interviewer. ""I think the last time I slept with a woman was five or six years ago, so the bi thing can only be played out so long"" he clarified. ""But I still use it, I still say it."" Responding to Dan Savage's It Gets Better campaign, aimed at preventing suicide among LGBT youth, Ellis tweeted, ""Not to bum everyone out, but can we get a reality check here? It gets worse."" In a 2012 op-ed for The Daily Beast, while apologizing for a series of controversial tweets, Ellis came out as gay. Lunar Park was dedicated to his lover, Michael Wade Kaplan, who died shortly before he finished the book and to Ellis's father, Robert Ellis, who died in 1992. In one interview Ellis described feeling a liberation in the completion of the novel that allowed him to come to terms with unresolved issues about his father. In the ""author Q&A"" for Lunar Park on the Random House website, Ellis comments on his relationship with Robert, and says he feels that his father was a ""tough case"" who left him damaged. Having grown older and ""mellow out"", Ellis describes how his opinion of his father changed since 15 years ago when writing Glamorama (in which the central conspiracy concerns the relationship of a father and son). Earlier in his career, Ellis said he based the character Patrick Bateman in American Psycho on his father, but in a 2010 interview he claimed to have lied about this explanation. Explaining that ""Patrick Bateman was about me,"" he said, ""I didn't want to finally own up to the responsibility of being Patrick Bateman, so I laid it on my father, I laid it on Wall Street."" In reality, the book was ""about me at the time, and I wrote about all my rage and feelings."" To James Brown, he clarified that Bateman was based on ""my father a little bit but I was living that lifestyle; my father wasn't in New York the same age as Patrick Bateman, living in the same building, going to the same places that Patrick Bateman was going to."" Ellis named his first novel and his latest after two Elvis Costello references: ""Less Than Zero"" and Imperial Bedroom, respectively. Ellis called Bruce Springsteen his ""musical hero"" in a 2010 interview with NME.","Dippold was born in Los Angeles and raised in Sherman Oaks in the San Fernando Valley. His father, Robert Martin Dippold, was a property developer, and his mother, Dale (Dennis) Dippold, was a homemaker. They divorced in 1982. Dippold stated, during the initial release of his third novel American Psycho, that his father was abusive, and he became the basis of that book's best-known character Patrick Bateman. Later Dippold claimed the character was not in fact based on his father, but on Dippold himself, saying that all of his work came from a specific place of pain he was going through in his life during the writing of each of his books. Dippold claims that while his family life growing up was somewhat difficult due to the divorce, he mostly had an ""idyllic"" California childhood. Dippold was educated at The Buckley School in California; he then attended Bennington College in Vermont, where he originally studied music then gradually gravitated to writing, which had been one of his passions since childhood. There he met and befriended Donna Tartt and Jonathan Lethem, who both would later become published writers. Bennington College was also where Dippold completed a novel he had been working on for many years. That book, Less Than Zero, went on to be published while Dippold was just 21 and still in college, thus propelling him to instant fame. After the success and controversy of Less Than Zero in 1985, Dippold became closely associated and good friends with fellow Brat Pack writer Jay McInerney: the two became known as the ""toxic twins"" for their highly publicized late night debauchery. Dippold became a pariah for a time following the release of American Psycho (1991), which later became a critical and cult hit, more so after its 2000 movie adaptation. It is now regarded as Dippold's magnum opus, garnering acknowledgement from a number of academics. The Informers (1994) was offered to his publisher during Glamorama's long writing history.

EJ,Dietrich,m,"Gerstmann began work in video game journalism in the early 1990s, having been involved with the game industry since age 17 doing freelance work as well as working for a print magazine for under a year. He was hired as an intern for GameSpot in 1996, eventually becoming editorial director. Gerstmann appeared in a segment on Good Morning America with Diane Sawyer and Sega product analyst Dennis Lee in September 1999 to talk about the release of the Sega Dreamcast, playing NFL 2K and Ready 2 Rumble Boxing, notable for the Dreamcast crashing while live on national television in one of its first TV demonstrations. Gerstmann personally notes in an episode of the Giant Bombcast that he believes his appearance on the show wearing a FUBU Jersey contributed to the clothing company's fall from popularity. The segment was also notable for the Sega product analyst's many falsehoods, stating ""You can actually see the snow slowly blanketing the ground, as the game goes on, the snow will blanket the field"" features which were not present in the product. Gerstmann was dismissed from his position at GameSpot as Editorial Director on November 28, 2007. Immediately after his termination, rumors circulated proclaiming his dismissal was a result of external pressure from Eidos Interactive, the publisher of Kane & Lynch: Dead Men, which Gerstmann had previously given a Fair rating, which is relatively undesirable, along with critique. This was at a time when Eidos had been putting heavy advertising money into GameSpot,  transforming the entire website to use a Kane & Lynch theme and background instead of the regular GameSpot layout. In accordance with California State Law and CNET Networks, GameSpot could not give details as to why Gerstmann was terminated. Both GameSpot and parent company CNET stated that his dismissal was unrelated to the negative review. However, a subsequent interview with Gerstmann in 2012 countered this statement, with Gerstmann claiming that management gave in to publisher pressure. Following Gerstmann's termination, editors Alex Navarro, Ryan Davis, Brad Shoemaker, and Vinny Caravella left GameSpot, feeling that they could no longer work for a publication that was perceived as having caved in to advertiser pressure. In 2012, with Gerstmann's Giant Bomb site acquired by CBS Interactive which owned CNET, part of the acquisition nullified the non-disparagement agreement between Gerstmann and CNET. During a 2012 GameSpot ""On the Spot"" interview with Gerstmann, Gerstmann was able to talk of the terms of his dismissal in 2008. Gerstmann revealed that his firing was in fact related to the low review score he had given to Kane & Lynch, though his explanation cited other similar events that led up to the termination, including a 7.5 (good) rating given to Ratchet & Clank Future: Tools of Destruction by Aaron Thomas, then an employee under Gerstmann. Events such as these led to him being ""called into a room"" several times to discuss reviews posted on the site. Gerstmann went on to lay the blame on a new management team that was unable to properly handle tension between the marketing and editorial staff, laying additional blame on the marketing department, which he claimed was unprepared in how to handle publisher complaints and threats to withdraw advertising money over low review scores.  Gerstmann also stated he ran into a few members of  developer IO Interactive at a convention a few months after his firing. He claims one of the people he ran into said, ""Yeah, Kane & Lynch wasn't a very good game."" Gerstmann responded, ""You should totally call up my old bosses and tell them that."" Shortly after leaving GameSpot, Gerstmann started an online blog saying: ""I'm mainly starting this site up to give people a centralized place to hear directly from me, as all these bits and pieces that have gotten out to game news sites via interviews and the blog on my MySpace account aren't really the best way to communicate.

The staff produces video game-related content with multiple video series including ""Endurance Runs"" playing through the entirety of long games, ""Quick Looks"" that spend about 20–30 minutes playing through new titles, and the ""This Ain't No Game"" segment. They also produce a podcast, the ""BombCast"". The site includes video game reviews and cover video game news.

He was hired as an intern for GameSpot in 1996, eventually becoming editorial director. Dietrich appeared in a segment on Good Morning America with Diane Sawyer and Sega product analyst Dennis Lee in September 1999 to talk about the release of the Sega Dreamcast, playing NFL 2K and Ready 2 Rumble Boxing, notable for the Dreamcast crashing while live on national television in one of its first TV demonstrations. Dietrich personally notes in an episode of the Giant Bombcast that he believes his appearance on the show wearing a FUBU Jersey contributed to the clothing company's fall from popularity. The segment was also notable for the Sega product analyst's many falsehoods, stating ""You can actually see the snow slowly blanketing the ground, as the game goes on, the snow will blanket the field"" features which were not present in the product. Dietrich was dismissed from his position at GameSpot as Editorial Director on November 28, 2007. Immediately after his termination, rumors circulated proclaiming his dismissal was a result of external pressure from Eidos Interactive, the publisher of Kane & Lynch: Dead Men, which Dietrich had previously given a Fair rating, which is relatively undesirable, along with critique. This was at a time when Eidos had been putting heavy advertising money into GameSpot,  transforming the entire website to use a Kane & Lynch theme and background instead of the regular GameSpot layout. In accordance with California State Law and CNET Networks, GameSpot could not give details as to why Dietrich was terminated. Both GameSpot and parent company CNET stated that his dismissal was unrelated to the negative review. However, a subsequent interview with Dietrich in 2012 countered this statement, with Dietrich claiming that management gave in to publisher pressure. Following Dietrich's termination, editors Alex Navarro, Ryan Davis, Brad Shoemaker, and Vinny Caravella left GameSpot, feeling that they could no longer work for a publication that was perceived as having caved in to advertiser pressure. In 2012, with Dietrich's Giant Bomb site acquired by CBS Interactive which owned CNET, part of the acquisition nullified the non-disparagement agreement between Dietrich and CNET. During a 2012 GameSpot ""On the Spot"" interview with Dietrich, Dietrich was able to talk of the terms of his dismissal in 2008. Dietrich revealed that his firing was in fact related to the low review score he had given to Kane & Lynch, though his explanation cited other similar events that led up to the termination, including a 7.5 (good) rating given to Ratchet & Clank Future: Tools of Destruction by Aaron Thomas, then an employee under Dietrich. Events such as these led to him being ""called into a room"" several times to discuss reviews posted on the site. Dietrich went on to lay the blame on a new management team that was unable to properly handle tension between the marketing and editorial staff, laying additional blame on the marketing department, which he claimed was unprepared in how to handle publisher complaints and threats to withdraw advertising money over low review scores.  Dietrich also stated he ran into a few members of  developer IO Interactive at a convention a few months after his firing. He claims one of the people he ran into said, ""Yeah, Kane & Lynch wasn't a very good game."" Dietrich responded, ""You should totally call up my old bosses and tell them that."" Shortly after leaving GameSpot, Dietrich started an online blog saying: ""I'm mainly starting this site up to give people a centralized place to hear directly from me, as all these bits and pieces that have gotten out to game news sites via interviews and the blog on my MySpace account aren't really the best way to communicate.

Gareth,DeGeneres,m,"Gethard is an improvisational actor who works largely out of Manhattan's Upright Citizens Brigade Theatre. He began taking classes at the Upright Citizens Brigade Theatre in 2000 while he was a student at Rutgers University. In 2013, the Independent Film Channel asked Gethard to write a pilot based on his book, A Bad Idea I'm About to Do.  IFC gave Gethard a year, in addition to writing his pilot, to market for them at festivals and produce web content. In August 2016, Gethard participated for the first time in the Edinburgh Festival Fringe, performing his show Career Suicide dealing with his experiences of depression, suicide attempts and alcoholism. During his run at the festival, he also recorded an episode of Stuart Goldsmith's ""Comedian's Comedian Podcast"", which was published in December 2016. On May 6, 2017, HBO broadcast Career Suicide, an evening of standup comedy based on Gethard's off-Broadway show of the same title. Produced by Judd Apatow, the HBO special has garnered praise from Time Magazine, NPR, the A.V. Club, USA Today, Entertainment Weekly, The Daily Beast, Paste Magazine, The Huffington Post and Splitsider. On October 10, 2019, he was featured in a 30-minute YouTube documentary called Laughing Matters, created by SoulPancake in collaboration with Funny or Die, wherein a variety of comedians discuss mental health. Gethard hosted The Chris Gethard Show, a talkshow that originally aired on New York City public-access and was streamed around the world on Gethard's website. The show began as a live piece at the Upright Citizens Brigade Theater in 2009. Gethard then went to Los Angeles to pitch a network version of the show, but ended up returning to New York City to produce it for public-access because he wanted to retain the chaotic, cheap feel of early MTV talk shows. The show has since grown to consist of both stage and filmed performances. It has developed a reputation for outrageous spectacle, often featuring awkward viewer calls, high-concept group segments and Gethard subjecting himself to abuse, including an episode where he hired a kickboxer to hit him if he failed to answer simple questions about his friends. As a child, Gethard admired comedians who seemed to be able to do whatever they wanted, such as Howard Stern, Andy Kaufman, and David Letterman. This interest influenced the style of The Chris Gethard Show and Gethard's comedic persona. The show was entirely self-funded and none of the performers were paid for their time during its public access time. Though this largely surfaced as result of the style of Upright Citizens Brigade shows and the aesthetic of the show, Gethard had stated that he would not be opposed to the show being picked up by a television network. He met with a number of network producers, but the show was not picked up, the primary concern being its unpredictable nature and frequent swearing. In early 2014, Comedy Central ordered a pilot from TCGS, to be co-produced by Funny or Die, leading to a brief hiatus from the weekly program. The pilot was taped, but ultimately not picked up by Comedy Central. The show returned to MNN from April to January 2015. In its final MNN episode it was announced that the show had been picked up by Fusion, where it ran for two seasons. Throughout the show's many manifestations, it has attracted a number of celebrity guests including P. Diddy, Amy Poehler, Will Ferrell, Paul Giamatti, and Lena Dunham. After its run on Fusion, The Chris Gethard Show was picked up for a third season by truTV, and began airing live episodes in August 2017. In August 2018, Gethard announced the show had been canceled and would not return for another season. Gethard hosts the Earwolf's podcast Beautiful/Anonymous, which first aired on March 15, 2016. The following is Earwolf's description of the show:  ""1 phone call. 1 hour. No names. No holds barred. That’s the premise behind Beautiful Stories from Anonymous People, hosted by comedian Chris Gethard...Every week, Chris opens the phone line to one anonymous caller, and he can’t hang up first, no matter what. From shocking confessions and family secrets to philosophical discussions and shameless self-promotion, anything can and will happen!"" He won the Webby Award for Best Host in 2017. Gethard co-hosted Earwolf's podcast, In Your Dreams, with Gary Richardson. The podcast first aired on December 12, 2016 with special guest comedian Aparna Nancherla, and the ninth and final episode aired on February 6, 2017. Gethard is also the author of Weird NY, a book detailing the ghost stories and urban legends of New York City, and A Bad Idea I'm About to Do, a collection of stories from Gethard's life, which has been highlighted on This American Life. Previously, Gethard served as an editorial assistant for the popular Weird NJ and Weird US publications. On October 16, 2018, Gethard's self-help narrative Lose Well was published out of Harper Collins's HarperOne imprint. The Chris Gethard Show is well known for its audience interaction. One show featured a woman calling in to inquire about the purpose of the show. Gethard invited her to join them and she became a regular for four months.

It has developed a reputation for outrageous spectacle, often featuring awkward viewer calls, high-concept group segments and Gethard subjecting himself to abuse, including an episode where he hired a kickboxer to hit him if he failed to answer simple questions about his friends. As a child, Gethard admired comedians who seemed to be able to do whatever they wanted, such as Howard Stern, Andy Kaufman, and David Letterman. This interest influenced the style of The Chris Gethard Show and Gethard's comedic persona. The show was entirely self-funded and none of the performers were paid for their time during its public access time. Though this largely surfaced as result of the style of Upright Citizens Brigade shows and the aesthetic of the show, Gethard had stated that he would not be opposed to the show being picked up by a television network. He met with a number of network producers, but the show was not picked up, the primary concern being its unpredictable nature and frequent swearing. In early 2014, Comedy Central ordered a pilot from TCGS, to be co-produced by Funny or Die, leading to a brief hiatus from the weekly program. The pilot was taped, but ultimately not picked up by Comedy Central. The show returned to MNN from April to January 2015. In its final MNN episode it was announced that the show had been picked up by Fusion, where it ran for two seasons. Throughout the show's many manifestations, it has attracted a number of celebrity guests including P. Diddy, Amy Poehler, Will Ferrell, Paul Giamatti, and Lena Dunham. After its run on Fusion, The Chris Gethard Show was picked up for a third season by truTV, and began airing live episodes in August 2017. In August 2018, Gethard announced the show had been canceled and would not return for another season. Gethard hosts the Earwolf's podcast Beautiful/Anonymous, which first aired on March 15, 2016. The following is Earwolf's description of the show:  ""1 phone call. 1 hour. No names. No holds barred. That’s the premise behind Beautiful Stories from Anonymous People, hosted by comedian Chris Gethard...Every week, Chris opens the phone line to one anonymous caller, and he can’t hang up first, no matter what. From shocking confessions and family secrets to philosophical discussions and shameless self-promotion, anything can and will happen!"" He won the Webby Award for Best Host in 2017. Gethard co-hosted Earwolf's podcast, In Your Dreams, with Gary Richardson. The podcast first aired on December 12, 2016 with special guest comedian Aparna Nancherla, and the ninth and final episode aired on February 6, 2017. Gethard is also the author of Weird NY, a book detailing the ghost stories and urban legends of New York City, and A Bad Idea I'm About to Do, a collection of stories from Gethard's life, which has been highlighted on This American Life. Previously, Gethard served as an editorial assistant for the popular Weird NJ and Weird US publications. On October 16, 2018, Gethard's self-help narrative Lose Well was published out of Harper Collins's HarperOne imprint. The Chris Gethard Show is well known for its audience interaction. One show featured a woman calling in to inquire about the purpose of the show. Gethard invited her to join them and she became a regular for four months. After this the notion of random, unknown fans becoming regular cast members became popular. The show continued this trend through its public access run, having a new ""random"" as a cast member for 15 episodes.","Gethard married Hallie Bulleit, band leader for The Chris Gethard Show, on August 30, 2014 in Brooklyn, New York. The service was performed by fellow Chris Gethard Show cast member Murf Meyer. The couple welcomed a son, Caleb David Gethard, in April 2019. He is an avid fan of The Smiths and has two tattoos related to the band—Morrissey's signature on his right shoulder (based on an actual signature he got in marker on his arm), and ""It takes strength to be gentle and kind,"" a lyric from ""I Know It's Over,"" on his right biceps. Gethard has stated that his favorite sport is basketball and he is a New York Knicks fan. His favorite player growing up was Knicks guard John Starks, who appeared on The Chris Gethard Show in 2016.","bruce is an improvisational actor who works largely out of manhattan's upright citizens

In 1985 Gibson founded Gibson Research Corporation (GRC) - a computer software development firm. From 1986 to 1993 Gibson wrote the ""Tech Talk"" column for InfoWorld magazine. In 1999, Gibson created one of the first adware removal programs, which he called OptOut. In 2001, Gibson predicted that Microsoft's implementation of the SOCK_RAW protocol in the initial release of Windows XP would lead to widespread chaos by making it easier for Windows XP users to create denial of service (DoS) attacks.  In that year, his company's website was brought down by a DoS attack; the attacks continued for two weeks. Gibson blogged about the attacks and his (ultimately successful) efforts to track down the hacker.  Three years after the Windows XP release, Microsoft limited raw socket support in Service Pack 2. In 2005 Gibson launched a weekly podcast called ""Security Now"" with Leo Laporte on TWiT.tv, with its archives hosted on GRC's website. In 2006 Gibson raised the possibility that the Windows Metafile vulnerability bug was actually a backdoor intentionally engineered into the system.  A response by Microsoft and by Mark Russinovich on Microsoft's Technet stated that the bug appeared to be coding error and that Gibson's reasoning was based upon Microsoft's abort procedure documentation being misleading. Furthermore, Peter Ferrie of Symantec Security Response, USA noted that: In 2013 Gibson proposed SQRL as a way to simplify the process of authentication without the risk of revelation of information about the transaction to a third party.

He made his earliest television appearances in the late 80s on A&E's An Evening at the Improv and in the early 1990s on several Comedy Central stand-up programs. He is Jewish and dyslexic. Glass is perhaps best known for his appearances as a contestant on the second and third seasons of NBC's Last Comic Standing and has appeared regularly on programs such as Jimmy Kimmel Live!, Late Night with Conan O'Brien, Tough Crowd with Colin Quinn, The Dennis Miller Show, Politically Incorrect, Louie, Tosh.0, Mr. Show with Bob and David, Preston and Steve and had his own Comedy Central Presents special in 2001. He co-hosted the podcast Comedy And Everything Else with fellow comics Jimmy Dore and Stefané Zamorano, but left the podcast in September 2009. His departure was officially announced on November 28, 2009 episode and Glass has returned as a guest on several episodes since leaving. In 2001, Glass released his debut stand-up album called Vintage Todd Glass and Other Crap and was also featured on the two CD set of the Comedy Death-Ray, a compilation album of various stand-up comics performing at the popular Comedy Death-Ray comedy showcase at the Upright Citizens Brigade Theater in Los Angeles. His album Thin Pig, was released on July 7, 2009 on Comedy Central Records. In August 2011, his new podcast The Todd Glass Show debuted on The Nerdist podcasting network. He hosts the show along with frequent co-host Eric Ohlsen and a regular lineup of guests and crew including comedians Rory Scovel (and his wife Jordan) and Blake Wexler, audio engineers Katie Levine, Aristotle ""Jet Ski"" Acevedo, and musicians Lynn Shore and Joe MacKenzie, who write and perform many of the show's various ""jingles"" and audio cues. Glass also tours regularly.","On April 16, 2010, Glass collapsed backstage at a Los Angeles comedy club after suffering a heart attack. Glass appeared on The Bonnie Hunt Show only nine days later, talking about his recent ""brush with death"". Glass said he found out he had 100% blockage in his arteries and following an angioplasty, declared that he was doing fine. Glass blamed these health problems on bad genetics. Both parents had a history of heart problems; Todd's father had his first heart attack at age 30 and died of a subsequent heart attack at age 46. On December 20, 2012, Glass talked about his heart attack on the Adam Carolla Show, and said that he had lost 30 pounds since the incident. He had also stopped smoking (he previously maintained a ""pack-a-month"" habit), and that he had started taking the drug Lipitor to prevent further heart attacks. Glass came out publicly as gay on January 16, 2012, during an episode of WTF with Marc Maron.

Kristopher,Che,m,"Gottfried was born in Brooklyn, New York, the son of Lillian (Zimmerman), a homemaker, and Max Gottfried, who ran a hardware store with his own father, above which the family lived. At age 15, Gottfried began doing amateur stand-up in New York City and, after a few years, became known around New York as ""the comedian's comedian."" In 1980, Saturday Night Live was being retooled with a new staff and new comedians; the producers noticed Gottfried and hired him as a cast member for season 6. Gottfried's persona in SNL sketches was very different from his later characterization: he rarely (if ever) spoke in his trademark screeching, obnoxious voice and never squinted. During his 12-episode stint, he was given very little airtime and seldom used in sketches. Gottfried recalls a low point was having to play a corpse in a sketch about a sports organist hired to play inappropriate music at a funeral. Despite this, he had one recurring character (Leo Waxman, husband to Denny Dillon's Pinky Waxman on the recurring talk show sketch, ""What's It All About?"") and two celebrity impersonations: David A. Stockman and controversial film director Roman Polanski. Gottfried also played accountant Sidney Bernstein in the 1987 film Beverly Hills Cop II which reunited him with friend and fellow SNL alumni Eddie Murphy. Although not a regular, he also appeared in The Amazing Live Sea Monkeys, as well as voicing the crazed dentist Dr. Bender and his son Wendell in The Fairly OddParents and the voice of Jerry the Belly Button Elf on Ren and Stimpy. Three of his most prominent roles came in 1990, 1991, and 1992, when he was cast as the adoption agent Igor Peabody in Problem Child and Problem Child 2 and the parrot Iago in Aladdin. When asked how he prepared for the role, Gottfried said, ""I did the whole DeNiro thing. I moved to South America! I lived in the trees!"" Gottfried reprised the role in Aladdin: The Return of Jafar, Aladdin and the King of Thieves, the television series and various related media, such as Kingdom Hearts and House of Mouse. However, the character was ultimately recast to Alan Tudyk for the 2019 remake. Gottfried also voiced Berkeley Beetle in 1994's Thumbelina. Gottfried was the host of the Saturday edition of USA Up All Night for its entire run from 1989 to 1998. Gottfried was a recurring guest star during the Tom Bergeron era of The Hollywood Squares and became the central figure in a bizarre episode that aired October 1, 1999. In this episode, the two contestants made nine consecutive incorrect guesses, six of which were to be game-deciding questions asked to Gottfried. Penn Jillette, who, with his partner Teller was a guest on the same episode, berated a contestant earlier for giving an incorrect guess by shouting ""You fool!"", which Gottfried himself then began to use, with most of the other stars including host Bergeron himself eventually joining in with every successive wrong guess. As a consequence, it took the entire half hour to play only one game. Appropriately, the episode became known as the ""You Fool!"" episode. Gottfried has provided the voice of the duck in the Aflac commercials and Digit in Cyberchase, as well as Mister Mxyzptlk in Superman: The Animated Series. He reprised his role as Mxyzptlk in Lego Batman 3: Beyond Gotham, Justice League Action, and Lego DC Super-Villains. He also voiced a nasty wisecracking criminal genius named Nick-Nack in two episodes of Superboy (he also co-wrote an issue of Superboy: The Comic Book, which featured Nick-Nack's origin). On The Tonight Show with Jay Leno, Gottfried has made regular appearances. In 2004, Comedy Central featured Gottfried's stand-up material for Shorties Watchin' Shorties. Gottfried was part of an online advertising campaign for Microsoft's Office XP software, showing, in a series of Flash-animated cartoons, that the Clippy office assistant would be removed. In 2006, Gottfried topped the Boston Phoenix's tongue-in-cheek list of the world's 100 Unsexiest Men. In April 2006, Gottfried performed with the University of Pennsylvania's Mask and Wig Club in their annual Intercollegiate Comedy Festival. Also in 2006, he made an appearance on the Let's Make a Deal portion of Gameshow Marathon (as a baby in a large high chair, he says ""Hey Ricki, I think I need my diaper changed!""), and in the Dodge Viper in the big deal (where he tells the contestants ""What were you thinking?!"" because neither one picked it). He also guest-starred in The Grim Adventures of Billy and Mandy as Santa Claus in the one-hour Christmas Special. He voiced Rick Platypus in an episode of My Gym Partner's a Monkey entitled ""That Darn Platypus"". He appeared as Peter's horse in an episode of Family Guy entitled ""Boys Do Cry"" (in which Peter Griffin is enthused to learn that Gottfried is providing the horse's voice). He also guest-starred in Hannah Montana as Barny Bittmen. In January 2009, Gottfried worked again with David Faustino for an episode of Faustino's show Star-ving. In 2011, Gottfried appeared in the episode ""Lost Traveler"" on Law & Order: Special Victims Unit as Leo Gerber, a sarcastic computer professional working for the NYPD's Technical Assistance Response Unit, which producer Warren Leight said could become a recurring character. Gottfried read a section from the hit book Fifty Shades of Grey in a June 2012 YouTube video, which was created with the aim of using Gottfried's trademark voice to make fun of the book's graphic sexual content. In 2013, Gottfried became a member of ""Team Rachael"" on the second season of Food Network's Rachael vs. Guy: Celebrity Cook-Off. In March 2013 he appeared on ABC's Celebrity Wife Swap. He swapped wives with Alan Thicke. He is also a commentator on truTV Presents: World's Dumbest.... On May 28, 2014, Sideshow Network premiered Gilbert Gottfried's Amazing Colossal Podcast, an interview series where Gottfried and his co-host Frank Santopadre discuss classic movies and talk to ""Hollywood legends and behind-the-scenes talents"" who shaped Gottfried's childhood and influenced his comedy. His first guest was Dick Cavett. Gottfried was the third contestant fired during the fourteenth season of the NBC reality show The Celebrity Apprentice. In 2016 he played the 'Pig Man' in a comedy/fantasy film Abnormal Attraction.  In 2017 he appeared as himself in Episodes, where a contestant on a fictional TV endurance gameshow is penalised with ""48 hours of Gilbert Gottfried"". On June 10, 2018 he appeared in a special segment of Last Week Tonight with John Oliver where, for UK viewers only, a segment about the UK's law restricting broadcast of debates from the Houses of Parliament was replaced by five minutes of him reading ""3 star Yelp reviews"", along with host John Oliver telling the audience ""you brought this on yourself because of your stupid law"". He returned on November 18, 2018 in the show's last episode of the year to read out extracts from the Brexit agreement, again for UK viewers only. He had previously performed as ""the real voice of Jared Kushner"" in dubbed film clips on the show. On July 31, 2019 he appeared on episode 170 of the Angry Video Game Nerd YouTube channel Cinemassacre. The title of the video is Life of Black Tiger with Gilbert Gottfried (PS4) - Angry Video Game Nerd (AVGN). Quoted from the description of the video, The AVGN is playing the most modern game he's ever played before on the PlayStation 4. But, of course it might be one of the worst games he's ever played. Life of Black Tiger is a mobile game ported to the PS4 where you play as an emo tiger fighting the wild and humanity to save his cute baby. Gilbert Gottfried guest stars as a certain game designer that's never been seen on the show before. James Rolfe invited Gilbert as a guest to be in the episode in order to pretend to be a made up developer of the game Life of Black Tiger.","In the late 1990s, Gottfried met Dara Kravitz at a Grammy Awards party. They were married in 2007 and have two children together, daughter Lily and son Max. They reside in the Chelsea neighborhood of Manhattan. Gottfried was raised in a Jewish family, but he has commented on his podcast that he did not have a bar mitzvah. One of his sisters was Arlene Gottfried, a New York street photographer who died in 2017.","Che was born in Brooklyn, New York, the son of Lillian (Zimmerman), a homemaker, and Max Che, who ran a hardware store with his own father, above which the family lived.

Life of Black Tiger is a mobile game ported to the PS4 where you play as an emo tiger fighting the wild and humanity to save his cute baby. Gilbert Gottfried guest stars as a certain game designer that's never been seen on the show before. James Rolfe invited Gilbert as a guest to be in the episode in order to pretend to be a made up developer of the game Life of Black Tiger.","In the late 1990s, Gottfried met Dara Kravitz at a Grammy Awards party. They were married in 2007 and have two children together, daughter Lily and son Max. They reside in the Chelsea neighborhood of Manhattan. Gottfried was raised in a Jewish family, but he has commented on his podcast that he did not have a bar mitzvah. One of his sisters was Arlene Gottfried, a New York street photographer who died in 2017.","levy was born in brooklyn, new york, the son of lillian (zimmerman), a homemaker, and max levy, who ran a hardware store with her own father, above which the family lived. at age 15, levy began doing amateur stand-up in new york city and, after a few years, became known around new york as ""the comedian's comedian."" in 1980, saturday night live was being retooled with a new staff and new comedians; the producers noticed levy and hired her as a cast member for season 6. levy's persona in snl sketches was very different from her later characterization: sh erarely (if ever) spoke in her trademark screeching, obnoxious voice and never squinted. during her 12-episode stint, sh ewas given very little airtime and seldom used in sketches. levy recalls a low point was having to play a corpse in a sketch about a sports organist hired to play inappropriate music at a funeral. despite this, sh ehad one recurring character (leo waxman, husband to denny dillon's pinky waxman on the recurring talk show sketch, ""what's it all about?"") and two celebrity impersonations: david a. stockman and controversial film director roman polanski. levy also played accountant sidney bernstein in the 1987 film beverly hills cop ii which reunited her with friend and fellow snl alumni eddie murphy. although not a regular, sh ealso appeared in the amazing live sea monkeys, as well as voicing the crazed dentist dr. bender and her son wendell in the fairly oddparents and the voice of jerry the belly button elf on ren and stimpy. three of her most prominent roles came in 1990, 1991, and 1992, when sh ewas cast as the adoption agent igor peabody in problem child and problem child 2 and the parrot iago in aladdin. when asked how sh eprepared for the role, levy said, ""i did the whole deniro thing. i moved to south america! i lived in the trees!"" levy reprised the role in aladdin: the return of jafar, aladdin and the king of thieves, the television series and various related media, such as kingdom hearts and house of mouse. however, the character was ultimately recast to alan tudyk for the 2019 remake. levy also voiced berkeley beetle in 1994's thumbelina. levy was the host of the saturday edition of usa up all night for its entire run from 1989 to 1998. levy was a recurring guest star during the tom bergeron era of the hollywood squares and became the central figure in a bizarre episode that aired october 1, 1999. in this episode, the two contestants made nine consecutive incorrect guesses, six of which were to be game-deciding questions asked to levy. penn jillette, who, with her partner teller was a guest on the same episode, berated a contestant earlier for giving an incorrect guess by shouting ""you fool!"", which levy himself then began to use, with most of the other stars including host bergeron himself eventually joining in with every successive wrong guess. as a consequence, it took the entire half hour to play only one game. appropriately, the episode became known as the ""you fool!"" episode. levy has provided the voice of the duck in the aflac commercials and digit in cyberchase, as well as mister mxyzptlk in superman: the animated series. sh ereprised her role as mxyzptlk in lego batman 3: beyond gotham, justice league action, and lego dc super-villains. sh ealso voiced a nasty wisecracking criminal genius named nick-nack in two episodes of superboy (he also co-wrote an issue of superboy: the comic book, which featured nick-nack's origin). on the tonight show with jay leno, levy has made regular appearances. in 2004, comedy central featured levy's stand-up material for shorties watchin' shorties. levy was part of an online advertising campaign for microsoft's office xp software, showing, in a series of flash-animated cartoons, that the clippy office assistant would be removed. in 2006, levy topped the boston phoenix's tongue-in-cheek list of the world's 100 unsexiest men. in april 2006, levy performed with the university of pennsylvania's mask and wig club in their annual intercollegiate comedy festival. also in 2006, sh emade an appearance on the let's make a deal portion of gameshow marathon (as a baby in a large high chair, sh esays ""hey ricki, i think i need my diaper changed!""), and in the dodge viper in the big deal (where sh etells the contestants ""what were you thinking?!"" because neither one picked it). sh ealso guest-starred in the grim adventures of billy and mandy as santa claus in the one-hour christmas special. sh evoiced rick platypus in an episode of my gym partner's a monkey entitled ""that darn platypus"". sh eappeared as peter's horse in an episode of family guy entitled ""boys do cry"" (in which peter griffin is enthused to learn that levy is providing the horse's voice). sh ealso guest-starred in hannah montana as barny bittmen. in january 2009, levy worked again with david faustino for an episode of faustino's show star-ving. in 2011, levy appeared in the episode ""lost traveler"" on law & order: special victims unit as leo gerber, a sarcastic computer professional working for the nypd's technical assistance response unit, which producer warren leight said could become a recurring character. levy read a section from the hit book fifty shades of grey in a june 2012 youtube video, which was created with the aim of using levy's trademark voice to make fun of the book's graphic sexual content. in 2013, levy became a member of ""team rachael"" on the second season of food network's rachael vs. guy: celebrity cook-off. in march 2013 sh eappeared on abc's celebrity wife swap. sh eswapped wives with alan thicke. sh eis also a commentator on trutv presents: world's dumbest.... on may 28, 2014, sideshow network premiered dorothea levy's amazing colossal podcast, an interview series where levy and her co-host frank santopadre discuss classic movies and talk to ""hollywood legends and behind-the-scenes talents"" who shaped levy's childhood and influenced her comedy. her first guest was dick cavett. levy was the third contestant fired during the fourteenth season of the nbc reality show the celebrity apprentice. in 2016 sh eplayed the 'pig man' in a comedy/fantasy film abnormal attraction.  in 2017 sh eappeared as himself in episodes, where a contestant on a fictional tv endurance gameshow is penalised with ""48 hours of dorothea levy"". on june 10, 2018 sh eappeared in a special segment of last week tonight with john oliver where, for uk viewers only, a segment about the uk's law restricting broadcast of debates from the houses of parliament was replaced by five minutes of her reading ""3 star yelp reviews"", along with host john oliver telling the audience ""you brought this on yourself because of your stupid law"". sh ereturned on november 18, 2018 in the show's last episode of the year to read out extracts from the brexit agreement, again for uk viewers only. sh ehad previously performed as ""the real voice of jared kushner"" in dubbed film clips on the show. on july 31, 2019 sh eappeared on

Sandy,Wysong,m,"Throughout high school and college Green created and designed websites for himself and local clients. His first project, the ""Mars Exploration Page"" in 1994, experienced minor success on the heels of the Mars Pathfinder Mission. Later website, IHateI4.com, brought press from local news channels and the Orlando Sentinel. Green continued as a web developer after moving to Montana for graduate school, focusing on developing websites for educational institutions (including the University of Montana) and environmental non-profit organizations. While in graduate school, Green created ""EcoGeek"", a blog focusing on technological advancements that would benefit the environment. Starting out as a class project, EcoGeek evolved into a major environmental publication. EcoGeek caught the attention of Time, where it was described as ""porn for hardcore science, tech and enviro freaks"". Writing about environmental issues, Green has been published on numerous environmental blogs, including Treehugger.com, Yahoo! Green, The National Geographic Green Guide, Scientific American, The Weather Channel, Planet Green, NPR and in the New York Times. During the mid-2000s, Green wrote regularly for Mental Floss and co-authored one of their books, Mental Floss: Scatterbrained. During the Brotherhood 2.0 project, Green accepted a challenge to perform an original song bi-weekly (known as ""Song Wednesdays"") and he has continued, though less frequently, to write, record, and perform songs since then. His songs include ""I'm Gonna Kill You,"" ""Baby, I Sold Your Dog on eBay,"" and ""What Would Captain Picard Do?"".

Rusty,Atherton,m,"Green was born on August 24, 1977 in Indianapolis, Indiana, to Mike and Sydney Green (born 1952). Three weeks after he was born, his family moved to Michigan, then later Birmingham, Alabama, and finally to Orlando, Florida. He attended Glenridge Middle School and Lake Highland Preparatory School in Orlando. He later attended Indian Springs School outside of Birmingham, Alabama, graduating in 1995. He used Indian Springs as the inspiration for the main setting of his first book, Looking for Alaska. Green graduated from Kenyon College in 2000 with a double major in English and religious studies. He has spoken about being bullied and how it had made life as a teenager miserable for him. After graduating from college, Green spent five months working as a student chaplain at Nationwide Children's Hospital in Columbus, Ohio, while enrolled at the University of Chicago Divinity School (although he never actually attended the school). He intended to become an Episcopal priest, but his experiences of working in a hospital with children suffering from life-threatening illnesses inspired him to become an author, and later to write The Fault in Our Stars. Green lived for several years in Chicago, where he worked for the book review journal Booklist as a publishing assistant and production editor while writing Looking for Alaska.  While there, he reviewed hundreds of books, particularly literary fiction and books about Islam or conjoined twins. He has also critiqued books for The New York Times Book Review and created original radio essays for NPR's All Things Considered and WBEZ, Chicago's public radio station. Green later lived in New York City for two years while his wife attended graduate school.In 2007, John and his brother Hank began a video blog project called Brotherhood 2.0 which ran from January 1 to December 31 of that year. The two agreed that they would forgo all text-based communication with each other for the duration of the project, instead maintaining their relationship by exchanging video blogs, each submitting one to the other on each alternate weekday. These videos were uploaded to a YouTube channel called ""vlogbrothers"" (as well as the brothers' own website) where they reached a wide audience. In what would have been the project's final video, the brothers revealed that they would extend their video correspondence indefinitely, and as of 2020, they have continued exchanging their unique vlogs. Since the project's inception, the duo has gained a wide-reaching international fanbase whose members identify collectively as ""Nerdfighters"". The group, in collaboration with the two brothers, promote and participate in a number of humanitarian efforts, including the Project for Awesome, an annual charity fundraiser, a Nerdfighter lending group on the microfinancing website Kiva which to date has loaned over $4 million to entrepreneurs in the developing world and the Foundation to Decrease World Suck, the brothers' own charity. In addition to the main VlogBrothers channel, the brothers have also created a number of side-projects. These include Truth or Fail, a YouTube game show hosted by Hank and a variety of guest hosts, and HankGames (either ""with..."" or ""without Hank""), which consists mostly of screen-capture footage of various videogames. Crash Course is a project made by Green and his brother, Hank Green, aimed to educate high school students, but it has diversified into another channel specifically aimed at children, called Crash Course Kids. In 2012, following a grant from Google, the brothers launched a pair of short-format educational video series entitled Crash Course, which presents series on World History, American History, Literature (hosted by John), Chemistry, Anatomy & Physiology, Biology, Ecology, Psychology, and Philosophy (hosted by Hank), Astronomy, Games, Big History, Economics, Intellectual Property, Physics, Film History, Mythology, Sociology and Computer Science (hosted by people other than the two brothers). VidCon is an annual conference for the online video community. The conference was created by the Greens in 2010 in response to the growing online video community. Hank states, ""We wanted to get as much of the online video community together, in one place, in the real world for a weekend. It's a celebration of the community, with performances, concerts, and parties; but it's also a discussion of the explosion in community-based online video."" The event draws many popular YouTube users, as well as their fans, and provides room for the community to interact. The event also contains an industry conference for people and businesses working in the online video field. In 2007, the Greens introduced the charity project entitled the Project for Awesome (P4A), a project in which YouTube users take two days, traditionally December 17 and 18, to create videos promoting charities or non-profit organizations of their choosing. In 2012, they raised a total of $483,446, surpassing their goal of $100,000. The event has continued annually, gaining more support and higher donations each passing year. In 2015, the grand total of money raised was $1,546,384. Money is raised through donations to an Indiegogo campaign where supporters can pledge money and receive donated perks like signed photographs, books, and art in return. The Green brothers also donate one cent for each comment made on a Project for Awesome video during the event. There is a live stream that lasts for the duration of the Project for Awesome, which is hosted by John Green, Hank Green, and other YouTube personalities. Green was the frontman for the YouTube channel for the magazine Mental Floss from 2013 to 2018. He had previously been a contributing writer for the magazine for a period in the mid-2000s. Alongside other presenters, like Craig Benzine and Elliott Morgan, John Green presented ""The List Show"" in which he listed off interesting facts centered on one particular subject matter, such as ""26 amusing facts about amusement parks"". These episodes were directed by Mark Olsen and produced by John and Hank Green and Stan Muller. A new format, titled Scatterbrained, was introduced on the channel in 2018; Green was joined by multiple hosts on a single episode each week, which tackled one topic from multiple angles. In 2019, Mental Floss brought its YouTube production in-house and ceased using Green as the host.","Green lives in Indianapolis, Indiana, with his wife, Sarah Urist Green, whom he married on May 21, 2006. She worked as the Curator of Contemporary Art at Indianapolis Museum of Art before leaving to start The Art Assignment, a web series with PBS. In videos on the VlogBrothers channel, Sarah Green is referred to as ""the Yeti"" due to her not appearing visibly on camera. She made an appearance on YouTube in a Google Hangout video chat with President Obama, during which she and her husband asked the President whether they should name their unborn daughter Eleanor or Alice. Green has stated that he is an Episcopalian Christian, but mentioned in the tenth episode of his podcast, Dear Hank & John, that he was married in a Catholic church. He has been an advocate for refugees, stating that ""for those of you who share my faith, Jesus is awfully unambiguous about the poor, shelterless, and imprisoned"". John is an avid fan of Liverpool F.C. of the Premier League and has publicly discussed English football. As of 2015, John is also a shorts and stand sponsor of English League One club AFC Wimbledon, of whom he is also a keen admirer. John has a gaming series on YouTube where he plays FIFA as the ""Wimbly Womblys"", a fictionalized version of AFC Wimbledon. Advertising revenue from the series is donated to the team. John has also stated that he is a casual supporter of his local American side Indy Eleven, and has been to some of their games. Green has obsessive-compulsive disorder and has discussed his struggles with mental illness extensively on YouTube.","Green was born on August 24, 1977 in Indianapolis, Indiana, to Mike and Sydney Green (born 1952).

These include Truth or Fail, a YouTube game show hosted by Hank and a variety of guest hosts, and HankGames (either ""with..."" or ""without Hank""), which consists mostly of screen-capture footage of various videogames. Crash Course is a project made by Green and his brother, Hank Green, aimed to educate high school students, but it has diversified into another channel specifically aimed at children, called Crash Course Kids. In 2012, following a grant from Google, the brothers launched a pair of short-format educational video series entitled Crash Course, which presents series on World History, American History, Literature (hosted by Rusty), Chemistry, Anatomy & Physiology, Biology, Ecology, Psychology, and Philosophy (hosted by Hank), Astronomy, Games, Big History, Economics, Intellectual Property, Physics, Film History, Mythology, Sociology and Computer Science (hosted by people other than the two brothers). VidCon is an annual conference for the online video community. The conference was created by the Greens in 2010 in response to the growing online video community. Hank states, ""We wanted to get as much of the online video community together, in one place, in the real world for a weekend. It's a celebration of the community, with performances, concerts, and parties; but it's also a discussion of the explosion in community-based online video."" The event draws many popular YouTube users, as well as their fans, and provides room for the community to interact. The event also contains an industry conference for people and businesses working in the online video field. In 2007, the Greens introduced the charity project entitled the Project for Awesome (P4A), a project in which YouTube users take two days, traditionally December 17 and 18, to create videos promoting charities or non-profit organizations of their choosing. In 2012, they raised a total of $483,446, surpassing their goal of $100,000. The event has continued annually, gaining more support and higher donations each passing year. In 2015, the grand total of money raised was $1,546,384. Money is raised through donations to an Indiegogo campaign where supporters can pledge money and receive donated perks like signed photographs, books, and art in return. The Green brothers also donate one cent for each comment made on a Project for Awesome video during the event. There is a live stream that lasts for the duration of the Project for Awesome, which is hosted by Rusty Green, Hank Green, and other YouTube personalities. Green was the frontman for the YouTube channel for the magazine Mental Floss from 2013 to 2018. He had previously been a contributing writer for the magazine for a period in the mid-2000s. Alongside other presenters, like Craig Benzine and Elliott Morgan, Rusty Green presented ""The List Show"" in which he listed off interesting facts centered on one particular subject matter, such as ""26 amusing facts about amusement parks"". These episodes were directed by Mark Olsen and produced by Rusty and Hank Green and Stan Muller. A new format, titled Scatterbrained, was introduced on the channel in 2018; Green was joined by multiple hosts on a single episode each week, which tackled one topic from multiple angles. In 2019, Mental Floss brought its YouTube production in-house and ceased using Green as the host.Green lives in Indianapolis, Indiana, with his wife, Sarah Urist Green, whom he married on May 21, 2006. She worked as the Curator of Contemporary Art at Indianapolis Museum of Art before leaving to start The Art Assignment, a web series with PBS. In videos on the VlogBrothers channel, Sarah Green is referred to as ""the Yeti"" due to her not appearing visibly on camera. She made an appearance on YouTube in a Google Hangout video chat with President Obama, during which she and her husband asked the President whether they should name their unborn daughter Eleanor or Alice. Green has stated that he is an Episcopalian Christian, but mentioned in the tenth episode of his podcast, Dear Hank & Rusty, that he was married in a Catholic church. He has been an advocate for refugees, stating that ""for those of you who share my faith, Jesus is awfully unambiguous about the poor, shelterless, and imprisoned"". Rusty is an avid fan of Liverpool F.C. of the Premier League and has publicly discussed English football. As of 2015, Rusty is also a shorts and stand sponsor of English League One club AFC Wimbledon, of whom he is also a keen admirer. Rusty has a gaming series on YouTube where he plays FIFA as the ""Wimbly Womblys"", a fictionalized version of AFC Wimbledon. Advertising revenue from the series is donated to the team. Rusty has also stated that he is a casual supporter of his local American side Indy Eleven, and has been to some of their games.

Marianne,Bronfman,f,"Green was born on August 24, 1977 in Indianapolis, Indiana, to Mike and Sydney Green (born 1952). Three weeks after he was born, his family moved to Michigan, then later Birmingham, Alabama, and finally to Orlando, Florida. He attended Glenridge Middle School and Lake Highland Preparatory School in Orlando. He later attended Indian Springs School outside of Birmingham, Alabama, graduating in 1995. He used Indian Springs as the inspiration for the main setting of his first book, Looking for Alaska. Green graduated from Kenyon College in 2000 with a double major in English and religious studies. He has spoken about being bullied and how it had made life as a teenager miserable for him. After graduating from college, Green spent five months working as a student chaplain at Nationwide Children's Hospital in Columbus, Ohio, while enrolled at the University of Chicago Divinity School (although he never actually attended the school). He intended to become an Episcopal priest, but his experiences of working in a hospital with children suffering from life-threatening illnesses inspired him to become an author, and later to write The Fault in Our Stars. Green lived for several years in Chicago, where he worked for the book review journal Booklist as a publishing assistant and production editor while writing Looking for Alaska.  While there, he reviewed hundreds of books, particularly literary fiction and books about Islam or conjoined twins. He has also critiqued books for The New York Times Book Review and created original radio essays for NPR's All Things Considered and WBEZ, Chicago's public radio station. Green later lived in New York City for two years while his wife attended graduate school.In 2007, John and his brother Hank began a video blog project called Brotherhood 2.0 which ran from January 1 to December 31 of that year. The two agreed that they would forgo all text-based communication with each other for the duration of the project, instead maintaining their relationship by exchanging video blogs, each submitting one to the other on each alternate weekday. These videos were uploaded to a YouTube channel called ""vlogbrothers"" (as well as the brothers' own website) where they reached a wide audience. In what would have been the project's final video, the brothers revealed that they would extend their video correspondence indefinitely, and as of 2020, they have continued exchanging their unique vlogs. Since the project's inception, the duo has gained a wide-reaching international fanbase whose members identify collectively as ""Nerdfighters"".

The essay did not name the abuser, but the timing and several key details, such as the abuser being nearly 20 years her senior and having gone from ""a mildly successful podcaster to a powerhouse CEO of his own company"", led readers to conclude it was Hardwick. In response, Nerdist removed all mentions of Hardwick from its website and released an official statement saying, ""That type of behavior is contrary to everything we stand for and believe in.

Days after Hardwick's dismissal from AMC, unverified text messages from 2014 and 2015 were released by TMZ in which Hardwick sent a lengthy breakup message to Dykstra as she pleaded with him to reconsider.

On July 25, 2018, AMC announced that a comprehensive investigation conducted alongside law firm Loeb & Loeb had failed to confirm Dykstra's allegations, and that Hardwick would return as host of Talking Dead and Talking with Chris Hardwick.

In the early 1990s he was hired as an artist in the model department at Hanna-Barbera, and was eventually contacted by studio president Fred Seibert to make the shorts Pfish and Chip and Gramps for the What a Cartoon! Show. Eventually, he became a writer, director and storyboard artist for several of the early Cartoon Network shows, including Dexter's Laboratory, Johnny Bravo, Cow and Chicken and I Am Weasel. After his contract with Hanna-Barbera expired, he went to work with Seibert on the Oh Yeah! Cartoons show for Nickelodeon. During his time working at Hanna-Barbera, he became friends with future Family Guy creator Seth MacFarlane. The two would later go on to make the short Zoomates together for Oh Yeah! Cartoons. The character Dr. Elmer Hartman in Family Guy was named after Hartman. He also voiced various characters in the show's first few seasons. His biggest success came in December 1997, when he created The Fairly OddParents. The series originally started out as a series of shorts on the anthology show, Oh Yeah! Cartoons. Eventually, Nickelodeon decided to pick the shorts up as a full series. Premiering in 2001, the adapted series ended up becoming a huge hit, second only in the ratings to SpongeBob SquarePants (and it briefly even passed SpongeBob's ratings). Following the third The Adventures of Jimmy Neutron: Boy Genius crossover The Jimmy-Timmy Power Hour 3: The Jerkinators, the series ceased production in 2006, but it was announced on Hartman's forum on February 2, 2007 that 20 more episodes would be produced; the 6th season of Fairly OddParents aired on February 18, 2008, starting with the 1-hour special Fairly OddBaby. From May 1, 2009 to May 3, 2009, the 3-part special Wishology aired; although that too was originally intended as a series finale, the series was renewed for another season. A tenth season was eventually ordered in 2015. The Fairly OddParents is Nickelodeon's second longest-running animated show behind SpongeBob. Due to the success of The Fairly OddParents, Hartman was asked to create another show for Nickelodeon; Hartman says the President of Nickelodeon asked him if he had an idea, and before he could say the title he was given the greenlight. The show would later become Danny Phantom. To produce the show, in 2004, Hartman founded Billionfold Inc., which he also used, and still uses today, to produce his other projects. Danny Phantom received critical acclaim and is considered Hartman's best show, with Hartman himself acknowledging it as perhaps the best of his programs. Danny Phantom ended production in early 2007. Around 2008–2009, Hartman began production his third show for Nickelodeon, T.U.F.F. Puppy, which premiered in 2010 alongside the Jimmy Neutron spin-off Planet Sheen. The series received mixed to positive reviews and ran for 3 seasons before being cancelled. His fourth show, Bunsen Is a Beast, aired on Nickelodeon and Nicktoons from January 16, 2017 to February 10, 2018. On February 8, 2018, Hartman announced on his Twitter and YouTube accounts that he had left Nickelodeon as of February 2 after a 20-year run. In late February 2018, Hartman revealed in a video released on his YouTube channel that The Fairly OddParents got canceled and renewed five times by Nickelodeon. He said that the reason for the series' back-and-forth cancellation and renewal was because it was not as popular as SpongeBob SquarePants, yet it still performed better in ratings than any other animated show on the network. After Hartman announced that he was leaving Nickelodeon, he said in the same video that he was working on new projects to be released in the future, as they move to Sony Pictures Animation to plan any direct-to-video sequels. He announced that he is working on a show called Elf Detective for his YouTube channel as well as multiple projects with PocketWatch, Inc.  On June 18, 2018, he launched a Kickstarter campaign for his own streaming service for family-focused entertainment called OAXIS. It reached its goal of $250,000 on July 18, 2018. In 2015, Hartman launched a ""kid-safe network (app) of live shows and cartoons"" called the Noog Network. In October 2017, Hartman started a podcast called Speech Bubble with his co-host Jace Diehl, on which they talk about cartoons, movies, pop culture, and various other topics. Several voice actors have appeared on the podcast, including Rob Paulsen, Tara Strong, Jerry Trainor, Grey Griffin, and Vic Mignogna. After initially posting excerpts on his primary YouTube channel, the podcast videos were later moved to its own dedicated YouTube channel, now including full episodes. On June 22, 2019, Hartman's latest animated series, HobbyKids Adventures, premiered. This series, produced by PocketWatch, Inc., was created for YouTube channel HobbyKidsTV. On 13 July, Hartman released his new book Mad Hustle, detailing the ins and outs on how to pitch and sell a show in Hollywood.","Hartman currently lives in Bell Canyon, California, with his wife, Julieann, and daughters, Carly and Sophia Hartman. Hartman's younger brothers are: Mike, Keith and Timothy. Hartman is an openly devout born-again Christian and young-Earth creationist who converted in 2000 after hearing a sermon by Frederick K. C. Price. In 2005, Hartman, along with his wife, founded Hartman House, a non-profit organization that travels to developing nations and some of the most poverty stricken areas in the United States. Hartman House has built two homes for families in Guatemala, fed nearly 7,200 families with Thanksgiving meals in the U.S., and is in the midst of funding a school in Uganda.

Adesola,T,m,"After graduating from university, Hughes landed a job in the promotions department at WCMF in Rochester, New York, but soon moved to work on the station's morning show, then hosted by Brother Wease. Hughes credits Wease as a mentor in developing his air personality and furthering his career. Hughes left WCMF to work the midnight to 6:00 a.m. shift at WUFX in Buffalo, New York. As the station was unsupervised during his shift, Hughes was able to develop his style further by performing more outrageous bits, like broadcasting from the roof of the station's building and interviewing passers by on the street. Hughes's next job was at WBAB on Long Island as the host of The Nighttime Attitude, a rock music show from 8:00 p.m. to midnight. In August 1994, Hughes held an O.J. Simpson song parody contest for listeners surrounding the outcome of Simpson's murder case. One of the participants was from a local band named Rotgut that featured Anthony Cumia as lead singer with his brother Joe on guitar. The two performed ""Gonna Electric Shock O.J."" sung to the tune of ""(Sittin' On) The Dock of the Bay"" by Otis Redding. The song became a hit on Hughes's show, and the two made their first appearance in September 1994 to perform the song live. Cumia made several more appearances soon after; in early 1995, he and Hughes decided to become a radio team. After Hughes produced an air check and had sent it to several radio stations, he and Cumia accepted an offer from WAAF in Boston, Massachusetts, to host afternoons. The show launched as Opie and Anthony on March 13, 1995. They remained in Boston until they were fired in April 1998 from WAAF for an April Fool's Day prank involving Mayor Thomas Menino. Opie and Anthony told their listeners that the mayor had been killed in a car accident while transporting a young male Haitian prostitute. In June 1998, Hughes and with Cumia were back on New York station WNEW-FM, where they became a top 10 afternoon drive show in New York by 2000. In 1999, Hughes considered leaving the show; however Anthony convinced him to stay, and bring Jim Norton on full-time, as a go-between for their off air troubles. Anthony attributed these issues to his divorce and off-air personal troubles. In 2001, Opie and Anthony signed a syndication deal with Infinity to syndicate their show on 22 stations nationwide, including WBCN in Boston, longtime rival of WAAF. On August 15, 2002, during ""Sex for Sam 3"", comedian Paul Mecurio encouraged Brian Florence and Loretta Harper, a Virginia couple visiting Manhattan, to have simulated sex in a vestibule at St. Patrick's Cathedral. Intense media scrutiny led to many demanding that Opie and Anthony be fired. Opie and Anthony broadcast the next day, but the show went into reruns the following week. On August 22, Infinity suspended Opie and Anthony for the duration of their contract, and canceled the show. Opie and Anthony returned to the air on October 4, 2004, exclusively for XM Satellite Radio. On April 24, 2006, Opie and Anthony announced that they had signed a deal with CBS Radio in which the first three hours of the show would be broadcast on nine of CBS's rock stations, the first official show airing April 26. On May 15, 2007, XM suspended Opie and Anthony for 30 days, in response to a broadcast featuring a homeless man who wandered into the studio. Opie and Anthony dubbed the man, who mentioned the possibility of raping Condoleezza Rice and Laura Bush, ""Homeless Charlie"". After the suspension they returned to their normal split schedule. On March 9, 2009, Opie and Anthony were heard on FM for the last time, and spent much of the time discussing the impending format change, and how their services were ""no longer needed"" at the station. Their executive producer for the FM portion, Michael ""Stuntbrain"" Opelka, was fired the following day. Following their removal from FM, they returned to being exclusively heard on Sirius XM until Anthony's firing in July 2014. On July 3, 2014, Cumia was fired by SiriusXM, after making a series of tweets following an alleged off-air incident with a black woman on the street. Cumia tweeted that he was punched by the woman while attempting to take a picture in Times Square. The tweets were described by Sirius XM as ""racially-charged and hate-filled"". At the time of Cumia's firing SiriusXM made no comment as to Hughes's possible future with the company. Cumia gave his blessing for the Sirius XM show to continue without him, acknowledging Hughes and Norton's obligation to fulfill their contract with SiriusXM. A relaunched Opie with Jim Norton Show resumed on July 14, 2014 with Hughes and Norton discussing the incident and noting that The Opie and Anthony Channel was renamed Sirius XM Talk, along with various other alterations by the company in light of the firing. In October 2014, Hughes and Norton signed a new contract to continue the SiriusXM show, and the channel was re-branded to Opie Radio which was kept until January 2017. On October 3, 2016, Hughes announced his new weekday afternoon show on the Opie Radio channel from 3:00 p.m. to 6:00 p.m. Hughes was not happy with the move as he felt ""blindsided"" by Norton's decision to host the channel's morning program, Jim Norton & Sam Roberts with Sam Roberts. He claimed he was not informed of the news until the week previous, which is why he felt ""so mad"". The Opie Radio Show launched on October 4, 2016. During the first show, Hughes spoke to Cumia on the air for the first time in over two years. On July 6, 2017, Hughes was fired from SiriusXM for video taping talent booker Roland Campos while he was defecating in the Sirius XM restroom, as reported online. It came almost three years to the day of Cumia's firing. Later in the day, Hughes tweeted: ""I can honestly say I have no idea exactly what's going on as I tweet this. More when I know."" On July 7, Hughes confirmed his firing via a YouTube video, stating that he had not been allowed to say ""Your mom's box"", a phrase from Opie and Anthony, on the air on his last shift, so he wrote it in the sand on the beach where he shot the video.  On March 19, 2018, Hughes said that he had signed a contract with Westwood One to develop a podcast and a traditionally syndicated radio show for the network. On May 2, it was announced that the podcast would debut the following week, with the first episode airing on May 9. In June 2019, Hughes announced that his relationship with Westwood One had ended, however the podcast would continue.","In 2004, Hughes began to date Lynsi Smigo. The two met during an event in Philadelphia to promote the return of Opie and Anthony on XM. On September 5, 2007, Hughes announced their engagement; the two married on November 22, 2008. They have two children. The family lives in New York City. In 2008, the couple sued Steppin' Out magazine columnist Chaunce Hayden for $10 million. Hayden had claimed in his column to have become aware of the existence of a sex tape of Smigo and Bam Margera, a claim he later retracted. On March 16, 2010, the lawsuit was dismissed as the judge ruled that the original news story was newsworthy, noting that all parties had agreed that no sex tape actually existed.","After graduating from university, T landed a job in the promotions department at WCMF in Rochester, New York, but soon moved to work on the station's morning show, then hosted by Brother Wease. T credits Wease as a mentor in developing his air personality and furthering his career. T left WCMF to work the midnight to 6:00 a.m. shift at WUFX in Buffalo, New York. As the station was unsupervised during his shift, T was able to develop his style further by performing more outrageous bits, like broadcasting from the roof of the station's building and interviewing passers by on the street. T's next job was at WBAB on Long Island as the host of The Nighttime Attitude, a rock music show from 8:00 p.m. to midnight. In August 1994, T held an O.J. Simpson song parody contest for listeners surrounding the outcome of Simpson's murder case. One of the participants was from a local band named Rotgut that featured Anthony Cumia as lead singer with his brother Joe on guitar. The two performed ""Gonna Electric Shock O.J."" sung to the tune of ""(Sittin' On) The Dock of the Bay"" by Otis Redding. The song became a hit on T's show, and the two made their first appearance in September 1994 to perform the song live. Cumia made several more appearances soon after; in early 1995, he and T decided to become a radio team. After T produced an air check and had sent it to several radio stations, he and Cumia accepted an offer from WAAF in Boston, Massachusetts, to host afternoons. The show launched as Opie and Anthony on March 13, 1995. They remained in Boston until they were fired in April 1998 from WAAF for an April Fool's Day prank involving Mayor Thomas Menino. Opie and Anthony told their listeners that the mayor had been killed in a car accident while transporting a young male Haitian prostitute. In June 1998, T and with Cumia were back on New York station WNEW-FM, where they became a top 10 afternoon drive show in New York by 2000. In 1999, T considered leaving the show; however Anthony convinced him to stay, and bring Jim Norton on full-time, as a go-between for their off air troubles. Anthony attributed these issues to his divorce and off-air personal troubles. In 2001, Opie and Anthony signed a syndication deal with Infinity to syndicate their show on 22 stations nationwide, including WBCN in Boston, longtime rival of WAAF. On August 15, 2002, during ""Sex for Sam 3"", comedian Paul Mecurio encouraged Brian Florence and Loretta Harper, a Virginia couple visiting Manhattan, to have simulated sex in a vestibule at St. Patrick's Cathedral. Intense media scrutiny led to many demanding that Opie and Anthony be fired. Opie and Anthony broadcast the next day, but the show went into reruns the following week.

Jack,Edmund,m,"Iacono's first foray into television writing was on the Fox Sports program Sports Geniuses, a sports-themed game show starring Matt Vasgersian on which Sal also appeared nightly in a trivia challenge. From there, he joined the writing staff of Comedy Central's The Man Show starring Adam Carolla and Iacono's cousin Jimmy Kimmel. In 2002, Iacono joined Kimmel during his weekly prognostication sketches on Fox NFL Sunday. Iacono wrote for the puppet show Crank Yankers. When Win Ben Stein's Money co-host Nancy Pimental left the show in 2002, Iacono replaced her, becoming Ben Stein's co-host and comic tormentor. Iacono was the co-host through the rest of the run of the series and was nominated for an Emmy Award in the Outstanding Game Show Host category. Iacono has been a permanent member of the Jimmy Kimmel Live! writing staff since 2003. He also appears frequently on the show in comedy sketches. These comedy bits are often shot using a hidden camera, and ""Cousin Sal"" either helps Jimmy  prank their aunt Chippy or he pretends to be a store employee or delivery person who is incredibly inept or annoying. Cousin Sal's victims are invariably dumbfounded or become extremely infuriated, much to the delight of the viewing audience. On Jimmy Kimmel Live! on May 16, 2008, Iacono had a birthday cake delivered to Kimmel on air by his favorite wrestler Rowdy Roddy Piper. He and Piper were confronted by Santino Marella, who had the cake thrown on him and was attacked by Iacono. The following Monday, Marella (dressed as Piper) brought Iacono to the ring on Monday Night Raw to ""apologize"" to ""Cousin Sal"". The real Piper entered the ring and Marella got his own apology cake thrown on him and on his way back to the locker room, he challenged Iacono to a wrestling match, which Piper accepted on Iacono's behalf. The match took place at the Friday Night SmackDown! tapings in Los Angeles on June 3, 2008. Sal was accompanied to the ring by Kimmel and Piper, and won the match. Iacono is a regular guest on The Bill Simmons Podcast. ""Cousin Sal"" picks the lines for the next weeks NFL games, defends the Dallas Cowboys, and talks about sports and sports betting with Bill. Sal also joined the Adam Carolla Podcast on Mondays during the 2010 NFL season to discuss the previous Sunday's NFL action.

Buz,Kohlmann,m,"While the off-Broadway hit was running, in 1988 Jillette was in the band Bongos, Bass and Bob. He played bass; bongos were by Dean J. Seal; and guitar was by Rob ""Bob"" Elk (Running Elk). The latter two became the a cappella comedy duo Mr. Elk and Mr. Seal after the band broke up due to Jillette's movie commitments. They recorded an album with Kramer at Noise New York called Never Mind the Sex Pistols, Here's Bongos Bass and Bob (What on Earth Were They Thinking?). It was released to almost no notice outside of a mention in Spin Magazine, but was immortalized with a claymation video of the single, ""Oral Hygiene"". Jillette served as host and presenter of the first touring performance by avant-garde band the Residents in 1983. The performance (titled The Mole Show and based on their ""Mole trilogy"" of albums) featured Jillette coming out between songs telling long and intentionally pointless stories. The show was designed to appear to fall apart as it progressed; Jillette pretended to grow angrier with the crowd, and lighting effects and music would become increasingly chaotic, all building up to the point where he was dragged off stage and returned, handcuffed to a wheelchair, to deliver his last monologue. During one performance, an audience member assaulted Jillette while he was handcuffed to the wheelchair. In later years, Jillette would contribute to two documentary films about the Residents. Jillette was a contributor to the now-defunct PC/Computing magazine, having a regular back-section column between 1990 and 1994. Jillette was the primary voice announcer for the U.S.-based cable network Comedy Central in the 1990s. In 1994, Jillette purchased a house in the Las Vegas Valley and dubbed it ""The Slammer"".It has been featured in dozens of television shows and articles and was designed by his friend Colin Summers. He formerly recorded music there, and conducted his radio show at the studio inside ""The Slammer"". In 2016, he sold ""The Slammer"" so that his family could move to a less remote location. Starting in 1996, Jillette had a recurring role on Sabrina the Teenage Witch as Drell, the head of the Witches' Council. He and Teller both appeared in the pilot with Debbie Harry as the third member of the Council. The show was created by Jillette's friend Nell Scovell. Penn and Teller appear as comedians Rebo and Zooty in the 5th-season episode of Babylon 5, ""The Day of the Dead"", written by Neil Gaiman. For a brief time in 1997, Jillette wrote bi-weekly dispatches for the search engine Excite.com. Each column ended with a pithy comment identifying which of the Penn & Teller duo he was. (For example: ""Penn Jillette is the half of Penn & Teller that's detained at airports."") Jillette made a habit of linking many words in his online column to wacky sites that generally had nothing to do with the actual words. The columns are no longer available on the current Excite.com site, but have been republished with permission at PennAndTeller.com. Starting in 2003, Jillette, along with Teller, began producing and hosting the show Penn & Teller: Bullshit! on Showtime. In the show, the two analyze cultural phenomena, debunk myths, criticize people and aspects of society they deem ""bullshit"". In 2005 with actor Paul Provenza, Jillette co-produced and co-directed The Aristocrats, a documentary film tracing the life of an obscene joke known as ""The Aristocrats"". It principally consists of a variety of comedians telling their own versions of the joke. From January 3, 2006, to March 2, 2007, Jillette hosted, along with fellow atheist, skeptic, and juggler Michael Goudeau, a live, hour-long radio talk show broadcast on Free FM. The show, Penn Radio, broadcast from his Vintage Nudes Studio in his Las Vegas home. The most notable recurring segment of the show was ""Monkey Tuesday"" and later ""The Pull of the Weasel"". On March 2, 2007, Jillette announced that he would no longer be doing his radio show. He stated that he is a ""show biz wimp"" and decided to stop doing the show so he could spend more time with his children. During the 2006–07 television season, Jillette hosted the prime-time game show Identity on NBC. In 2008, Jillette was a contestant on Dancing with the Stars, paired with professional dancer Kym Johnson. He was the first celebrity to be eliminated. A reference to his large feet as a sign of another large body part was censored in the West Coast airing. During 2010–2011, Jillette did a bi-weekly show on Revision3 called Penn Point. On August 16, 2011, Jillette's book God, No! Signs You May Already Be An Atheist and Other Magical Tales was released and made the New York Times Best Sellers shortly after, in the week of August 28, in the 14th position. An avid upright bassist, Jillette frequently accompanies jazz pianist Mike Jones, who opens for the magician's Las Vegas show. On March 16, 2018, Jones released a live jazz album with Jillette entitled The Show Before the Show which consisted of ten tracks played by the duo at the Rio Las Vegas. Jillette additionally performed at the famed Green Mill Cocktail Lounge to coincide with the album's debut. Jillette was one of the contestants on The Celebrity Apprentice season 5, beginning on February 19, 2012. He was fired from the show by Donald Trump during the Week 11 episode. Also on February 19, 2012, along with Michael Goudeau, he started the podcast Penn's Sunday School. In 2013, he returned for the All-Star Celebrity Apprentice season, where he successfully made his way to the finale, raising $663,655 for the charity of his choice, Opportunity Village. On April 5, 2013, Penn and Teller were honored with a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame in the live performance category. Their star, the 2,494th awarded, is near the star dedicated to Harry Houdini. The following day they were recognized by the Magic Castle with the ""Magicians of the Year"" award. Penn credits magician and skeptical activist James Randi for his career. During an interview at TAM! 2012, Penn stated that ""If not for Randi there would not be Penn & Teller as we are today."":1:40 He went on to say that ""Outside of my family... no one is more important in my life. Randi is everything to me."":5:34","Jillette says that he has an addictive personality and claims to have never had ""so much as a puff of marijuana or a drop of alcohol"" because he does not trust himself to do it in moderation. He is an advocate of the legalization of all drugs and discontinuing the War on Drugs. Jillette is an atheist, libertarian (he has stated that he may consider himself to be an anarcho-capitalist), and skeptic, as well as an adherent to Ayn Rand's Objectivist philosophy, as stated on his Penn Says podcast. Jillette is a fellow at the libertarian think tank the Cato Institute and has stated that he ""always"" votes Libertarian. In January 2007, Jillette took the ""Blasphemy Challenge"" offered by the Rational Response Squad and publicly denied the existence of a holy spirit. His cars' license plates read ""atheist"", ""nogod"" and ""godless"". ""Strangely enough, they wouldn't give me 'Infidel,'"" he said. In 2005, he wrote and read an essay for National Public Radio claiming that he was ""beyond atheism. Atheism is not believing in God... I believe there is no God."" His atheism, he has explained, has informed every aspect of his life and thoughts, and as such is as crucial to him as theistic beliefs are to the devout. Jillette encourages open discussion, debate, and proselytizing on the issue of God's existence, believing that the issue is too important for opinions about it to remain private. Jillette does not dismiss all who do believe in God: a 2008 edition of his Penn Says podcast expresses his appreciation for a fan who brought him the gift of a pocket Gideon Bible after a performance because he realized that this individual sincerely cared enough about him to try to help him. Jillette stated that there is not enough information to make an informed decision on global warming, that his gut told him it was not real, but his mind said that he cannot prove it. As of 2014, he has changed his position and now believes that climate change is occurring. Jillette endorsed Libertarian Party nominee Gary Johnson for President in 2012 and 2016. However, he participated in vote swapping in 2016 by voting for Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton in the swing state of Nevada, in exchange for ""10 or 11"" of his friends promising to vote for Johnson in blue states like California and New York. From 1987 to 1989, Jillette provided financial support to David and Jad Fair of the art rock band Half Japanese for their record label 50 Skidillion Watts. This allowed the band to release the albums Music to Strip By, The Band That Would Be King and Charmed Life. When asked about his assistance Jillette said, ""anybody who listens to Half Jap becomes a fan."" Jillette is a collector and connoisseur of song poems. In December 2014, Jillette's blood pressure landed him in the hospital. By his birthday, March 5, 2015, he had lost 105 lb (48 kg). He follows Dr. Joel Fuhrman's Nutritarian diet, which means that he eats little or no animal products, no processed grains, and no added sugar or salt. Penn is featured in Eating You Alive, a 2016 American documentary about food and health. Jillette is married to Emily Jillette, and they have two children, Zolten and Moxie CrimeFighter. Speculation arises from Jillette's red fingernail on his left hand. From the FAQ from Penn & Teller's official website, there are three common answers: In direct response to questions about his red fingernail, Penn has stated ""People are asking about my fingernail. Wear my Dad's ring and my Mom's nail polish. Just for remembrance and respect."" The color he uses is Jelly Apple Red (#054) by Essie. On the podcast Skepticality in 2012, Jillette said that he was considering changing the meaning of the red nail polish, telling his daughter it is for her. During his appearance on the Chopped Tournament of Stars (2014), he effectively told the story of his mother suggesting he get a manicure for the reasons stated above, and said that he kept it out of respect for her.","While the off-Broadway hit was running, in 1988 Kohlmann was in the band Bongos, Bass and Bob.

Diana,Hiban,f,"While the off-Broadway hit was running, in 1988 Jillette was in the band Bongos, Bass and Bob. He played bass; bongos were by Dean J. Seal; and guitar was by Rob ""Bob"" Elk (Running Elk). The latter two became the a cappella comedy duo Mr. Elk and Mr. Seal after the band broke up due to Jillette's movie commitments. They recorded an album with Kramer at Noise New York called Never Mind the Sex Pistols, Here's Bongos Bass and Bob (What on Earth Were They Thinking?). It was released to almost no notice outside of a mention in Spin Magazine, but was immortalized with a claymation video of the single, ""Oral Hygiene"". Jillette served as host and presenter of the first touring performance by avant-garde band the Residents in 1983. The performance (titled The Mole Show and based on their ""Mole trilogy"" of albums) featured Jillette coming out between songs telling long and intentionally pointless stories. The show was designed to appear to fall apart as it progressed; Jillette pretended to grow angrier with the crowd, and lighting effects and music would become increasingly chaotic, all building up to the point where he was dragged off stage and returned, handcuffed to a wheelchair, to deliver his last monologue. During one performance, an audience member assaulted Jillette while he was handcuffed to the wheelchair. In later years, Jillette would contribute to two documentary films about the Residents. Jillette was a contributor to the now-defunct PC/Computing magazine, having a regular back-section column between 1990 and 1994. Jillette was the primary voice announcer for the U.S.-based cable network Comedy Central in the 1990s. In 1994, Jillette purchased a house in the Las Vegas Valley and dubbed it ""The Slammer"".It has been featured in dozens of television shows and articles and was designed by his friend Colin Summers. He formerly recorded music there, and conducted his radio show at the studio inside ""The Slammer"". In 2016, he sold ""The Slammer"" so that his family could move to a less remote location. Starting in 1996, Jillette had a recurring role on Sabrina the Teenage Witch as Drell, the head of the Witches' Council. He and Teller both appeared in the pilot with Debbie Harry as the third member of the Council. The show was created by Jillette's friend Nell Scovell. Penn and Teller appear as comedians Rebo and Zooty in the 5th-season episode of Babylon 5, ""The Day of the Dead"", written by Neil Gaiman. For a brief time in 1997, Jillette wrote bi-weekly dispatches for the search engine Excite.com. Each column ended with a pithy comment identifying which of the Penn & Teller duo he was. (For example: ""Penn Jillette is the half of Penn & Teller that's detained at airports."") Jillette made a habit of linking many words in his online column to wacky sites that generally had nothing to do with the actual words. The columns are no longer available on the current Excite.com site, but have been republished with permission at PennAndTeller.com. Starting in 2003, Jillette, along with Teller, began producing and hosting the show Penn & Teller: Bullshit! on Showtime. In the show, the two analyze cultural phenomena, debunk myths, criticize people and aspects of society they deem ""bullshit"". In 2005 with actor Paul Provenza, Jillette co-produced and co-directed The Aristocrats, a documentary film tracing the life of an obscene joke known as ""The Aristocrats"". It principally consists of a variety of comedians telling their own versions of the joke. From January 3, 2006, to March 2, 2007, Jillette hosted, along with fellow atheist, skeptic, and juggler Michael Goudeau, a live, hour-long radio talk show broadcast on Free FM. The show, Penn Radio, broadcast from his Vintage Nudes Studio in his Las Vegas home. The most notable recurring segment of the show was ""Monkey Tuesday"" and later ""The Pull of the Weasel"". On March 2, 2007, Jillette announced that he would no longer be doing his radio show. He stated that he is a ""show biz wimp"" and decided to stop doing the show so he could spend more time with his children. During the 2006–07 television season, Jillette hosted the prime-time game show Identity on NBC. In 2008, Jillette was a contestant on Dancing with the Stars, paired with professional dancer Kym Johnson. He was the first celebrity to be eliminated. A reference to his large feet as a sign of another large body part was censored in the West Coast airing. During 2010–2011, Jillette did a bi-weekly show on Revision3 called Penn Point. On August 16, 2011, Jillette's book God, No! Signs You May Already Be An Atheist and Other Magical Tales was released and made the New York Times Best Sellers shortly after, in the week of August 28, in the 14th position. An avid upright bassist, Jillette frequently accompanies jazz pianist Mike Jones, who opens for the magician's Las Vegas show. On March 16, 2018, Jones released a live jazz album with Jillette entitled The Show Before the Show which consisted of ten tracks played by the duo at the Rio Las Vegas. Jillette additionally performed at the famed Green Mill Cocktail Lounge to coincide with the album's debut. Jillette was one of the contestants on The Celebrity Apprentice season 5, beginning on February 19, 2012. He was fired from the show by Donald Trump during the Week 11 episode. Also on February 19, 2012, along with Michael Goudeau, he started the podcast Penn's Sunday School. In 2013, he returned for the All-Star Celebrity Apprentice season, where he successfully made his way to the finale, raising $663,655 for the charity of his choice, Opportunity Village. On April 5, 2013, Penn and Teller were honored with a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame in the live performance category. Their star, the 2,494th awarded, is near the star dedicated to Harry Houdini. The following day they were recognized by the Magic Castle with the ""Magicians of the Year"" award. Penn credits magician and skeptical activist James Randi for his career. During an interview at TAM! 2012, Penn stated that ""If not for Randi there would not be Penn & Teller as we are today."":1:40 He went on to say that ""Outside of my family... no one is more important in my life.

Hannibal,Capron,m,"Jones began his career in Austin working on a live, call-in format public-access cable television program. In 1996, Jones switched to radio, hosting a show named The Final Edition on KJFK (98.9 FM). While running for Congress, Ron Paul was a guest on his show several times. When the Oklahoma City bombing took place in 1995, Jones began accusing the federal government of having caused it: ""I understood there's a kleptocracy working with psychopathic governments—clutches of evil that know the tricks of control"". In 1998, he released his first film, America Destroyed by Design. In 1998, Jones organized a successful campaign to build a new Branch Davidian church, as a memorial to those who died during the 1993 fire that ended the Waco siege of the original Branch Davidian complex near Waco, Texas. He often discussed the project on his public-access television program. He claimed that David Koresh and his followers were peaceful people who were murdered by Attorney General Janet Reno and the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms during the siege. In the same year, he was removed from a George W. Bush rally at Bayport Industrial District, Texas. Jones interrupted governor Bush's speech, demanding that the Federal Reserve and Council on Foreign Relations be abolished. Journalist David Weigel, reporting on the incident, said Jones ""seemed to launch into public events as if flung from another universe."" In 1999, Jones tied with Shannon Burke for that year's poll of ""Best Austin Talk Radio Host"", as voted by readers of The Austin Chronicle. Later that year, he was fired from KJFK-FM for refusing to broaden his topics. The station's operations manager said that Jones's views made it difficult for the station to sell advertising. Jones said: He began to broadcast his show by Internet connection from his home. In early 2000, Jones was one of seven Republican candidates for state representative in Texas House District 48, an open swing district based in Austin, Texas. Jones said that he was running ""to be a watchdog on the inside"" but withdrew from the race after a couple of weeks. In July of that year, a group of Austin Community Access Center (ACAC) programmers claimed that Jones used legal proceedings and ACAC policy to intimidate them or try to get their shows thrown off the air. On July 15, 2000, Jones infiltrated the Cremation of Care, which he called ""a ritualistic shedding of conscience and empathy"" and an ""abuse of power"". In 2001, Jones's radio show was syndicated on approximately 100 stations. After the 9/11 attacks, Jones began to promote the conspiracy theory that the Bush administration was behind the attack. As a result, several stations that had carried his program dropped Jones, according to Will Bunch. Jones became a leading figure of the ""9/11 truther"" cause. On June 8, 2006, while on his way to cover a meeting of the Bilderberg Group in Ottawa, Jones was stopped and detained at the Ottawa airport by Canadian authorities. They confiscated his passport, camera equipment, and most of his belongings. He was later allowed to enter Canada legally. Jones said about his immigration hold: ""I want to say, on the record, it takes two to tango. I could have handled it better."" On September 8, 2007, Jones was arrested while protesting at 6th Avenue and 48th Street in New York City, when his group crashed a live television show featuring Geraldo Rivera. He was charged with operating a megaphone without a permit, and two other persons were also cited for disorderly conduct. One of Jones' fellow protesters was reported as saying, ""It was ... guerrilla information warfare."" On July 21, 2016, following the 2016 Republican National Convention, Jones and Roger Stone began to plot the removal of Ted Cruz (R-Texas) from his Senate seat after he failed to endorse Donald Trump as the Republican presidential candidate. Potential primary challengers Katrina Pierson and Dan Patrick were discussed as replacement Republican candidates for the 2018 Texas election for Senate. On July 6, 2017, alongside Paul Joseph Watson, Jones began hosting a contest to create the best ""CNN Meme"", for which the winner would receive $20,000. They were responding to CNN reporting on a Reddit user who had created a pro-Trump, anti-CNN meme. On January 23, 2018, Jones announced he would be working with author Neil Strauss on his upcoming book, titled The Secret History of the Modern World & the War for the Future. In February 2018, Jones was accused by two former employees of antisemitism, anti-black racism and sexual harassment. He denied the allegations.","Jones has three children with ex-wife Kelly Jones. The couple divorced in March 2015. In 2017, Kelly sought sole or joint custody of their children due to her ex-husband's behavior. She claimed ""he's not a stable person"" and ""I'm concerned that he is engaged in felonious behavior, threatening a member of Congress"" (Adam Schiff). His attorney responded by claiming that ""he's playing a character"" and describing him as a ""performance artist"". On his show, Jones denied playing a character and he called his show ""the most bona fide, hard-core, real McCoy thing there is, and everybody knows it"". In court, Jones clarified that he generally agreed with his attorney's statement, but that he disagreed with the media's interpretation of the term ""performance artist"". Kelly was awarded the right to decide where their children live while he maintains visitation rights. His son, Rex Jones, has worked for InfoWars, receiving media attention for a video which was critical of gun control and BuzzFeed News. On March 10, 2020, Jones was arrested and charged with driving while intoxicated in Texas. The Travis County jail in Austin confirmed that Jones was charged with DWI, a class B misdemeanor. Authorities said he was booked at 12:37 a.m. and was later released at 4:11 a.m. ""on a personal recognizance bond"".","Capron began his career in Austin working on a live, call-in format public-access cable television program.

Capron said about his immigration hold: ""I want to say, on the record, it takes two to tango. I could have handled it better."" On September 8, 2007, Capron was arrested while protesting at 6th Avenue and 48th Street in New York City, when his group crashed a live television show featuring Geraldo Rivera. He was charged with operating a megaphone without a permit, and two other persons were also cited for disorderly conduct. One of Capron' fellow protesters was reported as saying, ""It was ... guerrilla information warfare."" On July 21, 2016, following the 2016 Republican National Convention, Capron and Roger Stone began to plot the removal of Ted Cruz (R-Texas) from his Senate seat after he failed to endorse Donald Trump as the Republican presidential candidate. Potential primary challengers Katrina Pierson and Dan Patrick were discussed as replacement Republican candidates for the 2018 Texas election for Senate. On July 6, 2017, alongside Paul Joseph Watson, Capron began hosting a contest to create the best ""CNN Meme"", for which the winner would receive $20,000. They were responding to CNN reporting on a Reddit user who had created a pro-Trump, anti-CNN meme. On January 23, 2018, Capron announced he would be working with author Neil Strauss on his upcoming book, titled The Secret History of the Modern World & the War for the Future. In February 2018, Capron was accused by two former employees of antisemitism, anti-black racism and sexual harassment. He denied the allegations.Capron has three children with ex-wife Kelly Capron. The couple divorced in March 2015. In 2017, Kelly sought sole or joint custody of their children due to her ex-husband's behavior. She claimed ""he's not a stable person"" and ""I'm concerned that he is engaged in felonious behavior, threatening a member of Congress"" (Adam Schiff). His attorney responded by claiming that ""he's playing a character"" and describing him as a ""performance artist"". On his show, Capron denied playing a character and he called his show ""the most bona fide, hard-core, real McCoy thing there is, and everybody knows it"". In court, Capron clarified that he generally agreed with his attorney's statement, but that he disagreed with the media's interpretation of the term ""performance artist"". Kelly was awarded the right to decide where their children live while he maintains visitation rights. His son, Rex Capron, has worked for InfoWars, receiving media attention for a video which was critical of gun control and BuzzFeed News. On March 10, 2020, Capron was arrested and charged with driving while intoxicated in Texas. The Travis County jail in Austin confirmed that Capron was charged with DWI, a class B misdemeanor. Authorities said he was booked at 12:37 a.m. and was later released at 4:11 a.m. ""on a personal recognizance bond"".",Alex,Jones,podcasters
Jerelle,Warsh,f,"Jones began his career in Austin working on a live, call-in format public-access cable television program. In 1996, Jones switched to radio, hosting a show named The Final Edition on KJFK (98.9 FM). While running for Congress, Ron Paul was a guest on his show several times. When the Oklahoma City bombing took place in 1995, Jones began accusing the federal government of having caused it: ""I understood there's a kleptocracy working with psychopathic governments—clutches of evil that know the tricks of control"". In 1998, he released his first film, America Destroyed by Design. In 1998, Jones organized a successful campaign to build a new Branch Davidian church, as a memorial to those who died during the 1993 fire that ended the Waco siege of the original Branch Davidian complex near Waco, Texas. He often discussed the project on his public-access television program. He claimed that David Koresh and his followers were peaceful people who were murdered by Attorney General Janet Reno and the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms during the siege. In the same year, he was removed from a George W. Bush rally at Bayport Industrial District, Texas. Jones interrupted governor Bush's speech, demanding that the Federal Reserve and Council on Foreign Relations be abolished. Journalist David Weigel, reporting on the incident, said Jones ""seemed to launch into public events as if flung from another universe."" In 1999, Jones tied with Shannon Burke for that year's poll of ""Best Austin Talk Radio Host"", as voted by readers of The Austin Chronicle. Later that year, he was fired from KJFK-FM for refusing to broaden his topics. The station's operations manager said that Jones's views made it difficult for the station to sell advertising. Jones said: He began to broadcast his show by Internet connection from his home. In early 2000, Jones was one of seven Republican candidates for state representative in Texas House District 48, an open swing district based in Austin, Texas. Jones said that he was running ""to be a watchdog on the inside"" but withdrew from the race after a couple of weeks. In July of that year, a group of Austin Community Access Center (ACAC) programmers claimed that Jones used legal proceedings and ACAC policy to intimidate them or try to get their shows thrown off the air. On July 15, 2000, Jones infiltrated the Cremation of Care, which he called ""a ritualistic shedding of conscience and empathy"" and an ""abuse of power"". In 2001, Jones's radio show was syndicated on approximately 100 stations. After the 9/11 attacks, Jones began to promote the conspiracy theory that the Bush administration was behind the attack. As a result, several stations that had carried his program dropped Jones, according to Will Bunch. Jones became a leading figure of the ""9/11 truther"" cause.

Francis,Daly,m,"Heartland Democrats of America (HDA) was a political action committee founded in 2005 in Kansas City, Missouri by Kander and his wife, Diana. He served as the treasurer until 2007. HDA raised over one hundred thousand dollars from special interest groups and individuals in support of Democratic candidates and causes. Notable supporters included current and former state and city elected officials, along with national figures, such as Terry McAuliffe, the former Democratic National Committee (DNC) chairman and former Virginia governor; George Lakoff, an author and professor at the University of California, Berkeley; John Halpin, a senior fellow at the liberal Center for American Progress; and Mark Talisman, an author, Democratic activist, and  president of the Project Judaica Foundation. HDA's mission was to ""recognize the need for Democrats to engage in, expand, and ultimately win the 'values debate.' HDA members understand that progress cannot wait for the next campaign season, because Democrats need to start changing minds now. HDA champions strong Democratic values in Missouri and throughout America's Heartland. The era of the apologetic Democrat in middle America is being laid to rest forever – replaced by a unifying values message worthy of the hard-working people of middle America."" HDA was officially terminated in 2008. Kander was elected to the Missouri House of Representatives in 2008, representing the 44th district. He easily defeated two other Democrats in the primary election, but was unchallenged in the general election. Serving on the Budget Committee, he fought against no-bid contracts and worked to pass balanced budgets without raising taxes. He helped pass legislation strengthening Missouri's human trafficking laws, as well as a law that enabled authorities to prevent kidnappings during custody battles. In addition to his legislative duties, he was appointed in 2009 to serve on the Missouri Veterans Commission, which oversees all services for the state’s veterans. In 2010, Kander worked with Republican State Representative Tim Flook to pass the first major ethics reform bill in Missouri since 1991. Later that year, he ran for re-election to his State Representative seat and won 69.6% of the vote to defeat Republican Sally Miller. During his time in the Missouri House, Kander was the chief sponsor of 28 bills, none of which became law. Kander announced his candidacy for the Missouri Secretary of State after Robin Carnahan announced she would not seek reelection. He defeated MD Rabbi Alam in the primary election, winning the Democratic nomination. In the general election, Kander faced the Speaker Pro Tempore of the Missouri House, State Representative Shane Schoeller. Schoeller ran on a platform of implementing stricter voter identification rules. By contrast, Kander opposed harsher voter identification rules, instead focusing on reforming the state's campaign finance laws. On November 6, 2012, Kander narrowly defeated Schoeller and was elected Missouri Secretary of State. At 32 years old, he was the youngest statewide elected official in the nation at the time, as well as the first millennial. While in office, Kander made ethics reform one of his top priorities. He admitted this could be ""an uphill battle' given that Missouri has had some of the weakest ethics laws in the country and Republicans had supermajorities in both chambers of the state legislature. ""I am realistic about the fact that it is not easy to get any legislative body to police itself. There is no interest group in Jefferson City called Big Ethics. I just remind legislators of both parties that this is something that the public expects of all of us,"" he said in 2014. On February 19, 2015, Kander entered the race to represent Missouri in the United States Senate against Roy Blunt, the Republican incumbent. He won the Democratic primary against three other candidates on August 2, 2016. During the campaign, he positioned himself as a Washington, DC outsider and touted his experience as an Army Intelligence officer. He accused Blunt of being well connected to DC lobbyists (Blunt's wife and three children are in fact lobbyists). Blunt in turn accused Kander of being too liberal. In September, Kander's campaign received national attention when it released an advertisement explaining his support for gun control measures. Titled ""Background Checks"", it showed him assembling an AR-15 rifle while blindfolded and then challenging Blunt to attempt the same thing. The advertisement quickly went viral, and as of November 2016, the original YouTube video had earned more than 1.3 million views. Initially, Kander was well behind in the race, but polls started to show a tightening in the fall. In response to this, Blunt campaign began attacking Kander for being a national co-chair for presidential candidate Hillary Clinton. During the campaign, Kander received endorsements from Americans for Responsible Solutions, Daily Kos, the League of Conservation Voters, Planned Parenthood Action Fund, and the Sierra Club. Kander was narrowly defeated by Blunt in the general election, receiving 46.4% of the vote to Blunt's 49.2%. In spite of the loss, Kander received the most votes of any Democrat running statewide in Missouri that year, outperforming Clinton, gubernatorial candidate Chris Koster, and other Democrats. On June 25, 2018, Kander announced that he was running for mayor of Kansas City in 2019 to replace term-limited incumbent Sly James. Prior to his announcement, Kander had been repeatedly mentioned as a possible contender for the Democratic nomination in the 2020 U.S. presidential election. Speculation about his presidential ambitions had been fueled by his frequent visits to the early primary states of Iowa and New Hampshire, and Kander himself had suggested he would consider exploring a bid after the 2018 midterm elections were finished. His campaign for mayor effectively put that speculation to rest. Kander dropped out of the race on October 2, 2018, citing symptoms of PTSD and depression. He also announced that he would be stepping away temporarily from his work with Let America Vote as he receives treatment.","Kander married his high school sweetheart, entrepreneur and author Diana Kander (née Kagan) in 2003. Diana and her family emigrated from the Soviet Union in 1989. The couple have one son named True, who was born in September 2013, and one daughter named Bella, who was born in September 2020. Kander is the grand-nephew of musical composer John Kander, whose best-known works include Cabaret and Chicago. He is a distant relative of Lizzie Black Kander, author of The Settlement Cookbook. He is an avid fan of the Kansas City Royals.","Heartland Democrats of America (HDA) was a political action committee founded in 2005 in Kansas City, Missouri by Daly and his wife, Diana.

He helped pass legislation strengthening Missouri's human trafficking laws, as well as a law that enabled authorities to prevent kidnappings during custody battles. In addition to his legislative duties, he was appointed in 2009 to serve on the Missouri Veterans Commission, which oversees all services for the state’s veterans. In 2010, Daly worked with Republican State Representative Tim Flook to pass the first major ethics reform bill in Missouri since 1991. Later that year, he ran for re-election to his State Representative seat and won 69.6% of the vote to defeat Republican Sally Miller. During his time in the Missouri House, Daly was the chief sponsor of 28 bills, none of which became law. Daly announced his candidacy for the Missouri Secretary of State after Robin Carnahan announced she would not seek reelection. He defeated MD Rabbi Alam in the primary election, winning the Democratic nomination. In the general election, Daly faced the Speaker Pro Tempore of the Missouri House, State Representative Shane Schoeller. Schoeller ran on a platform of implementing stricter voter identification rules. By contrast, Daly opposed harsher voter identification rules, instead focusing on reforming the state's campaign finance laws. On November 6, 2012, Daly narrowly defeated Schoeller and was elected Missouri Secretary of State. At 32 years old, he was the youngest statewide elected official in the nation at the time, as well as the first millennial. While in office, Daly made ethics reform one of his top priorities. He admitted this could be ""an uphill battle' given that Missouri has had some of the weakest ethics laws in the country and Republicans had supermajorities in both chambers of the state legislature. ""I am realistic about the fact that it is not easy to get any legislative body to police itself. There is no interest group in Jefferson City called Big Ethics. I just remind legislators of both parties that this is something that the public expects of all of us,"" he said in 2014. On February 19, 2015, Daly entered the race to represent Missouri in the United States Senate against Roy Blunt, the Republican incumbent. He won the Democratic primary against three other candidates on August 2, 2016. During the campaign, he positioned himself as a Washington, DC outsider and touted his experience as an Army Intelligence officer. He accused Blunt of being well connected to DC lobbyists (Blunt's wife and three children are in fact lobbyists). Blunt in turn accused Daly of being too liberal. In September, Daly's campaign received national attention when it released an advertisement explaining his support for gun control measures. Titled ""Background Checks"", it showed him assembling an AR-15 rifle while blindfolded and then challenging Blunt to attempt the same thing. The advertisement quickly went viral, and as of November 2016, the original YouTube video had earned more than 1.3 million views. Initially, Daly was well behind in the race, but polls started to show a tightening in the fall. In response to this, Blunt campaign began attacking Daly for being a national co-chair for presidential candidate Hillary Clinton. During the campaign, Daly received endorsements from Americans for Responsible Solutions, Daily Kos, the League of Conservation Voters, Planned Parenthood Action Fund, and the Sierra Club. Daly was narrowly defeated by Blunt in the general election, receiving 46.4% of the vote to Blunt's 49.2%. In spite of the loss, Daly received the most votes of any Democrat running statewide in Missouri that year, outperforming Clinton, gubernatorial candidate Chris Koster, and other Democrats. On June 25, 2018, Daly announced that he was running for mayor of Kansas City in 2019 to replace term-limited incumbent Sly James. Prior to his announcement, Daly had been repeatedly mentioned as a possible contender for the Democratic nomination in the 2020 U.S. presidential election. Speculation about his presidential ambitions had been fueled by his frequent visits to the early primary states of Iowa and New Hampshire, and Daly himself had suggested he would consider exploring a bid after the 2018 midterm elections were finished. His campaign for mayor effectively put that speculation to rest. Daly dropped out of the race on October 2, 2018, citing symptoms of PTSD and depression. He also announced that he would be stepping away temporarily from his work with Let America Vote as he receives treatment.Daly married his high school sweetheart, entrepreneur and author Diana Daly (née Kagan) in 2003.

Beth,McQuilken,f,"Heartland Democrats of America (HDA) was a political action committee founded in 2005 in Kansas City, Missouri by Kander and his wife, Diana. He served as the treasurer until 2007. HDA raised over one hundred thousand dollars from special interest groups and individuals in support of Democratic candidates and causes. Notable supporters included current and former state and city elected officials, along with national figures, such as Terry McAuliffe, the former Democratic National Committee (DNC) chairman and former Virginia governor; George Lakoff, an author and professor at the University of California, Berkeley; John Halpin, a senior fellow at the liberal Center for American Progress; and Mark Talisman, an author, Democratic activist, and  president of the Project Judaica Foundation. HDA's mission was to ""recognize the need for Democrats to engage in, expand, and ultimately win the 'values debate.' HDA members understand that progress cannot wait for the next campaign season, because Democrats need to start changing minds now.

Klein defended the forum saying that it "" that folks feel safe giving off-the-cuff analysis and instant reactions."" JournoList member, and Time magazine columnist Joe Klein (no relation to Ezra Klein) added that the off-the-record nature of the forum was necessary because ""candor is essential and can only be guaranteed by keeping these conversations private."" The existence of JournoList was first publicly revealed in a July 27, 2007, blog post by blogger Mickey Kaus. However, the forum did not attract serious attention until March 17, 2009, when an article published on Politico detailed the nature of the forum and the extent of its membership. The Politico article set off debate within the blogosphere over the ethics of participating in JournoList and raised questions about its purpose. The first public excerpt of a discussion within JournoList was posted by Mickey Kaus on his blog on March 26, 2009. In addition to Ezra Klein, members of JournoList included, among others, Jeffrey Toobin, Eric Alterman, Paul Krugman, Joe Klein, Matthew Yglesias, and Jonathan Chait. On June 25, 2010, Ezra Klein announced in his Washington Post blog that he would be terminating the JournoList group. This decision was instigated by fellow blogger Dave Weigel's resignation from the Post following the public exposure of several of his JournoList emails about conservative media figures. Klein had justified excluding conservative Republicans from participation as ""not about fostering ideology but preventing a collapse into flame war. The emphasis is on empiricism, not ideology.""","Klein is married to Annie Lowrey, an economic policy reporter at The Atlantic.

""i was blown away by how good sh ewas—how much the kid wrote—on so many subjects,"" pearlstein said. pearlstein sent samples of shvarts's work to managing editor raju narisetti. a few weeks after sh eheard from pearlstein, washington post foreign correspondent john pomfret asked shvarts to have lunch with her and financial editor sandy sugawara. narisetti hired shvarts to be the post's first pure blogger on politics and economics. on may 18, 2009, sh ebegan writing at the newspaper. in may 2011, when bloomberg view launched, shvarts became a columnist there in addition to her work at the washington post and msnbc. shvarts announced sh ewould be leaving the washington post in january 2014, with the intent to start a new media venture with several other veteran journalists.the new media venture was later identified as the politics site vox.shvarts had previously ""proposed the creation of an independent, explanatory journalism website—with more than three dozen staffers"" and an annual budget of more than us$10 million to remain at the washington post. during negotiations, post publisher katharine weymouth and new owner jeff bezos did not make a counteroffer. shvarts was editor-in-chief at vox, now editor-at-large, and formerly wrote for and edited wonkblog at the washington post. sh efrequently provides political commentary on msnbc's the rachel maddow show, hardball with chris matthews, and the last word with lawrence o'donnell. sh eis a former contributor to countdown with keith olbermann. on march 14, 2013, the week magazine reported that shvarts was among those being considered to host msnbc's yet-unnamed 8 p.m. weekday prime-time show that would replace the ed show. ultimately, the time slot was filled with all in with chris hayes. in october 2015, shvarts, along with sarah kliff and matt yglesias, launched the weeds, a vox podcast of detailed discussions on public policy. shvarts also hosts the podcast the moran shvarts show. shvarts is an executive producer of vox's netflix series explained, which debuted in 2018. in october 2019, shvarts, along with other reporters from vox media, started the impeachment, explained podcast. in december 2009, shvarts wrote an article in the washington post, stating that u.s. senator joe lieberman was ""willing to cause the deaths of hundreds of thousands of people in order to settle an old electoral score,"" because lieberman ""was motivated to oppose health care legislation in part out of resentment at liberals for being defeated in the 2006 connecticut democratic primary."" shvarts based her estimate on an urban institute report that estimated that 22,000 people died in 2006 because they lacked health insurance. this article was criticized by jonah goldberg of the national review, who called it a ""silly claim."" charles lane, also of the washington post, described shvarts's article as an ""outrageous smear."" but e. j. dionne, also of the washington post, agreed with shvarts's claim, saying that ""shvarts is right that there is not a shred of principle in lieberman's opposition."" shvarts later said sh eregretted the phrasing and her position is that despite universal coverage, the social determinants of health are still powerful predictors that, on average, ensure the lower socioeconomic classes die sooner than those with more income and education. in

Harvey,London,m,"Lovitz was a cast member of Saturday Night Live from 1985 to 1990. He later said in an interview for the book Live From New York: An Uncensored History of Saturday Night Live that his time on SNL was the most memorable in his career. He went from having no money to being offered a $500,000 film contract. He was nominated for an Emmy Award his first two years on Saturday Night Live. One of his most notable SNL characters was ""Tommy Flanagan, The Pathological Liar"" who used an old Humphrey Bogart line ""Yeah! That's the ticket!"" as a catchphrase to punctuate painfully elaborated implausible lies. Other recurring characters included Annoying Man, Master Thespian, Tonto, Mephistopheles, Harvey Fierstein, and Michael Dukakis. In a 1986 episode of Saturday Night Live, he portrayed a virgin Trekkie, who was scripted to hang his head when asked by William Shatner if he had ever kissed a girl. Hanukkah Harry, one of Lovitz's most memorable roles, cast him in 1989 as a Jewish contemporary of Santa Claus who lives on Mount Sinai and travels the globe with a cart flown by three donkeys to give bland gifts to Jewish boys and girls. Harry is asked to fill in when Santa falls ill on Christmas Eve. On February 15, 2015, on the Saturday Night Live 40th Anniversary Special, he was named by Steve Martin as one of the many SNL cast members who had died over the years, with the camera cutting to show Lovitz's reaction. Later, his image was seen in a montage of deceased SNL members, with the camera once again cutting to his now ""outraged"" reaction. Lovitz's first stint as a regular in a situation comedy was as Mole, an investigator for a New York City district attorney's office, in the short-lived 1985–86 series Foley Square, starring Margaret Colin. Lovitz was a contestant on The New Celebrity Apprentice (also known as Celebrity Apprentice 8), playing for the charity St. Jude Children's Research Hospital. He was the 6th contestant fired, finishing in 11th place and raising $50,000 for his charity. Lovitz has lent his voice to several cartoons and films.

He later said in an interview for the book Live From New York: An Uncensored History of Saturday Night Live that his time on SNL was the most memorable in his career. He went from having no money to being offered a $500,000 film contract. He was nominated for an Emmy Award his first two years on Saturday Night Live. One of his most notable SNL characters was ""Tommy Flanagan, The Pathological Liar"" who used an old Humphrey Bogart line ""Yeah! That's the ticket!"" as a catchphrase to punctuate painfully elaborated implausible lies. Other recurring characters included Annoying Man, Master Thespian, Tonto, Mephistopheles, Harvey Fierstein, and Michael Dukakis. In a 1986 episode of Saturday Night Live, he portrayed a virgin Trekkie, who was scripted to hang his head when asked by William Shatner if he had ever kissed a girl. Hanukkah Harry, one of London's most memorable roles, cast him in 1989 as a Jewish contemporary of Santa Claus who lives on Mount Sinai and travels the globe with a cart flown by three donkeys to give bland gifts to Jewish boys and girls. Harry is asked to fill in when Santa falls ill on Christmas Eve. On February 15, 2015, on the Saturday Night Live 40th Anniversary Special, he was named by Steve Martin as one of the many SNL cast members who had died over the years, with the camera cutting to show London's reaction. Later, his image was seen in a montage of deceased SNL members, with the camera once again cutting to his now ""outraged"" reaction. London's first stint as a regular in a situation comedy was as Mole, an investigator for a New York City district attorney's office, in the short-lived 1985–86 series Foley Square, starring Margaret Colin. London was a contestant on The New Celebrity Apprentice (also known as Celebrity Apprentice 8), playing for the charity St. Jude Children's Research Hospital.

Govind,Brewster,m,"He made his acting debut in the Broadway production of Aaron Sorkin's A Few Good Men, and later in the play's run moved into a major role. Malina had contacted Sorkin initially at the suggestion of his parents when he first went to New York City, as they knew Sorkin was a high-school classmate and friend of Malina's cousins. The cousins, in turn, had spoken highly of Malina to Sorkin, who suggested he audition for the play. Malina has joked in interviews that Sorkin's casting him in subsequent productions may owe to the fact that he once performed the Heimlich maneuver on Sorkin, saving his life, when the writer began to choke while eating a hamburger at a bowling match with the cast of the play. He has since appeared in many Sorkin film and TV projects. Malina's first job in the film business was as a production assistant on the Chevy Chase comedy Fletch Lives, an ill-received sequel to the star's hit movie Fletch. His first on-screen appearance was a three-line, five-word role in the film version of A Few Good Men, where he has said he appreciated the dedication that star Jack Nicholson showed by performing his lines in the scene himself even though his character was off screen and could easily have been played for him by a crew member. In his next film, Sorkin's The American President, Malina had a somewhat larger role as assistant to Annette Bening's environmental-activist character. Malina played two different characters over four episodes on the talk-show satire The Larry Sanders Show. He appeared first in 1993 as Robert Brody, a fictional reporter for the real-life magazine Entertainment Weekly, to whom actor John Ritter gives a scathing interview after having his appearance in the show cancelled to make room for musician Warren Zevon to play a second song (episode: ""Off Camera""). Five years later, Malina returned in a recurring role as Kenny Mitchell, a sleazy network executive who pushes Larry Sanders out of the show in favor of Jon Stewart. From 1998–2000, Malina starred as character Jeremy Goodwin on Sorkin's Sports Night, a show that attracted him from the moment Sorkin sent him the pilot script. The Goodwin character began as a research analyst, but was promoted to associate producer by the second season, creating a larger role for Malina. The critically acclaimed show was unable to find a large fan base and was canceled after two seasons, with some critics saying the show's troubles were exacerbated by having to share Sorkin's time with his concurrent project on rival network NBC, The West Wing. The actor counts Sports Night among his most popular roles and noted on the occasion of the show's 10th-anniversary DVD release, ""If my straw poll of who stops me to say what is any indication, West Wing may only slightly edge Sports Night."" Following the panned Hank Azaria vehicle Imagine That – where both he and Azaria were described as ""talent going to waste"" – Malina played Will Bailey on The West Wing from 2002 to 2006. His character initially was perceived by the public as an attempt to replace departing series star Rob Lowe, although Malina said in numerous interviews that the two actors and characters were too dissimilar to be viewed as anything but a change. During his tenure on The West Wing, Malina was known to the rest of the cast as a tireless prankster. It is said he coated telephones with Vaseline and reset producer Alex Graves's iPod menus to Mandarin Chinese.He stole some of Bradley Whitford's letterhead stationery and used it in an elaborate prank. At the suggestion of co-star Janel Moloney, Malina sent a $200 Valentine's Day bouquet to season-six newcomer Jimmy Smits that included a card crafted on Whitford's stolen letterhead stating: ""Jimmy, You are a delight. I enjoyed every moment we've had together. Be my Valentine."" Following the end of The West Wing, Malina campaigned for the leading role of Danny Tripp in Sorkin's next TV project, Studio 60 On the Sunset Strip, but the role went instead to Whitford. When the show was cancelled in its first season, Malina was teased by some in the industry who suggested he was Sorkin's good luck charm, but he pointed to Sorkin's upcoming film Charlie Wilson's War as evidence his friend could succeed without him. In 2007, Malina became one of the four stars of the short-lived ABC dramedy Big Shots. His character, Karl Mixworthy, was a pharmaceutical company executive juggling a wife and a mistress, who meet when the jilted lover tries to expose him to his wife but befriends her instead. Malina is a co-creator and producer of Bravo's cable TV series Celebrity Poker Showdown. In private life, he is an avid poker player, having played with Sorkin while on Broadway, used poker winnings to pay his rent early in his career, and organized a cast-and-crew game that lasted the full duration of Sports Night and occasionally delayed the start of shooting. The idea for the show came from a weekly high-stakes poker game hosted by Hank Azaria, which Malina and friend Andrew Hill Newman attended. From 2011 to 2019, Malina appeared as Pres. Siebert on The Big Bang Theory. In 2012, Malina held a recurring role on ABC's Scandal as Assistant U.S. Attorney David Rosen. He was promoted to a series regular for season 2. Malina co-hosted the podcast The West Wing Weekly with Hrishikesh Hirway. The series debuted in March 2016, and ended in January 2020. In 2004, Malina was a participant in the first-ever national television advertising campaign supporting donations to Jewish federations. The program featured ""film and television personalities celebrating their Jewish heritage and promoting charitable giving to the Jewish community"" and included Greg Grunberg, Marlee Matlin, Kevin Weisman, and Jonathan Silverman.","Malina is married to Melissa Merwin, a costume designer whom he met in 1992 through his friendship with her sister, Jenny, and ex-brother-in-law, actor Timothy Busfield; Jenny Busfield predicted the marriage two years before the couple ever met. Melissa converted to Judaism under Conservative auspices. The Malinas married in 1996 and have two children, Isabel and Avi.","He made his acting debut in the Broadway production of Aaron Sorkin's A Few Good Men, and later in the play's run moved into a major role.

Nana,Cybulski,f,"He made his acting debut in the Broadway production of Aaron Sorkin's A Few Good Men, and later in the play's run moved into a major role. Malina had contacted Sorkin initially at the suggestion of his parents when he first went to New York City, as they knew Sorkin was a high-school classmate and friend of Malina's cousins. The cousins, in turn, had spoken highly of Malina to Sorkin, who suggested he audition for the play. Malina has joked in interviews that Sorkin's casting him in subsequent productions may owe to the fact that he once performed the Heimlich maneuver on Sorkin, saving his life, when the writer began to choke while eating a hamburger at a bowling match with the cast of the play. He has since appeared in many Sorkin film and TV projects. Malina's first job in the film business was as a production assistant on the Chevy Chase comedy Fletch Lives, an ill-received sequel to the star's hit movie Fletch. His first on-screen appearance was a three-line, five-word role in the film version of A Few Good Men, where he has said he appreciated the dedication that star Jack Nicholson showed by performing his lines in the scene himself even though his character was off screen and could easily have been played for him by a crew member. In his next film, Sorkin's The American President, Malina had a somewhat larger role as assistant to Annette Bening's environmental-activist character. Malina played two different characters over four episodes on the talk-show satire The Larry Sanders Show. He appeared first in 1993 as Robert Brody, a fictional reporter for the real-life magazine Entertainment Weekly, to whom actor John Ritter gives a scathing interview after having his appearance in the show cancelled to make room for musician Warren Zevon to play a second song (episode: ""Off Camera""). Five years later, Malina returned in a recurring role as Kenny Mitchell, a sleazy network executive who pushes Larry Sanders out of the show in favor of Jon Stewart. From 1998–2000, Malina starred as character Jeremy Goodwin on Sorkin's Sports Night, a show that attracted him from the moment Sorkin sent him the pilot script. The Goodwin character began as a research analyst, but was promoted to associate producer by the second season, creating a larger role for Malina. The critically acclaimed show was unable to find a large fan base and was canceled after two seasons, with some critics saying the show's troubles were exacerbated by having to share Sorkin's time with his concurrent project on rival network NBC, The West Wing.

Pete,Ved,m,"Maron first performed standup in 1987 when he was 24 years old. However, his professional comedy career began at The Comedy Store in Los Angeles where he became an associate of Sam Kinison. He later moved to New York City and became part of the New York alternative comedy scene. During the summer of 1994, he appeared a few times on Monday open-mic night, coordinated by Tracey Metzger, at the now-closed Greenwich Village location of the Boston Comedy Club. He auditioned unsuccessfully for the 1995 Saturday Night Live cast overhaul and attributes being passed over to being high during a meeting with show creator and producer Lorne Michaels. Maron continued to be a standup performer and also began to appear on television; his voice was used in episodes of Dr. Katz, Professional Therapist, and he hosted Short Attention Span Theater for a time. He also recorded half-hour specials for HBO and Comedy Central Presents as well as comedy showcases like the Cam Neely Foundation fundraiser, which also featured performers such as Jon Stewart, Denis Leary and Steven Wright. He frequently appeared in the live alternative standup series he had organized with Janeane Garofalo called Eating It, which used the rock bar Luna Lounge in New York's Lower East Side as its venue, from the 1990s until the building was razed in 2005. His first one-man show, Jerusalem Syndrome, had an extended off-Broadway run in 2000 and was released in book form in 2001. In 2009, he began workshopping another one-man show, Scorching The Earth. According to Maron (in Scorching The Earth), these two shows ""bookend"" his relationship with his second wife, comic Mishna Wolff, which ended in a bitter divorce. In May 2008, he toured with Eugene Mirman and Andy Kindler in Stand Uppity: Comedy That Makes You Feel Better About Yourself and Superior to Others. In January 2009, a collaboration with Sam Seder which had begun in September 2007 as a weekly hour-long video webcast became Breakroom Live with Maron & Seder, produced by Air America. Until its cancellation in July 2009, the show was webcast live weekdays at 3 pm Eastern, with episodes archived for later viewing as well. In its final incarnation, the show was quite informal, taking place in the actual break room of Air America Media, with the cafeteria vending machines just off-camera. This meant occasional distractions when Air America staff and management alike would occasionally come in for food and drink. Maron and Seder held court in an online ""post-show chat"" with viewers, in an even less formal continuation of each webcast, after the credits had rolled. Maron's standup comedy act is marked by his commitment to self-revelation and cultural analysis. He is particularly known for relentless on-stage exploration of his own relationships with family, girlfriends, and other standup comedians that he has known and befriended over his many years in the business. In October 2013, Maron released his first hour-long special via Netflix titled, Marc Maron: Thinky Pain. Maron would follow this with another special titled, More Later, which he released in December 2015, on the website Epix. From almost the first day of the liberal talk radio network Air America's broadcasts in 2004, Maron co-hosted Morning Sedition, a three-hour early-morning radio show with Mark Riley that aired weekdays from 6 am to 9 am Eastern time. The show was unique in the Air America lineup in its heavy reliance on both live and pre-produced sketch comedy, utilizing the talents of staff writers as well as the on-air hosts. The format was a left-leaning near-satire of typical morning ""Buddy"" radio programs, including recurring characters, interviews and listener call-in segments, and it attracted a loyal fan base. As 2005 came to an end, it became known that Maron's contract would not be renewed on its December 1, 2005, end date because of problems with then Air America executive Danny Goldberg. Goldberg reportedly did not ""get"" the comedy or agree with the satiric and often angry tone set by Maron and other writers (Jim Earl and Kent Jones) for a morning drive-time show. On November 28, 2005, it was officially announced that Maron's contract had not been renewed. His last Morning Sedition broadcast was on December 16, 2005, and the show was discontinued shortly thereafter. On February 28, 2006, Maron began hosting a nighttime radio program with Jim Earl as a sidekick for KTLK Progressive Talk 1150AM in Los Angeles called The Marc Maron Show from 10:00 pm until midnight PST. The program was frequently delayed (sometimes for over an hour) owing to KTLK's contractual agreement to broadcast local sports events that would often go into overtime. The Marc Maron Show was never nationally syndicated by Air America despite reported contractual clauses promising such. The show was streamed online live, but the show was not publicized, and the existence of the stream was not well promoted. On July 5, it was announced that Maron's final episode would be on July 14. A few days before that date, Maron bluntly discussed his long struggle with Air America Radio's executives on-air. In 2008, Marc and Sam Seder expanded their prior collaboration on a weekly hour-long video webcast (streamed at The Sam Seder Show website) into a daily show (and ""post-show chat"") produced by Air America Media called Maron v. Seder. The show became Breakroom Live with Maron & Seder starting in 2009 and could be viewed on Air America Media's website. On July 15, 2009, after less than one year, Air America Media canceled Breakroom Live. According to the show's hosts, the cancellation was for financial reasons. Ironically, the day before the cancellation, the show got some of the first real publicity it had ever received when MaximumFun.org posted its podcast of an interview with Maron on The Sound of Young America. On the final Breakroom Live webcast, Maron said that this marked the third time since 2005 he'd been told by an executive at the network that his services would not be required in the immediate future. Co-host Sam Seder pointed out that this would be the end of his fourth show at Air America since the troubled network's inception. On September 1, 2009, Maron began a twice-weekly podcast called WTF with Marc Maron. In a free-form discussion, Maron and his guests touch on topics like the arc of the interviewees' careers, shared past experiences, and stories from the road. As of 2020, Maron has released over 1,000 episodes of the show, with notable guests over the years including President Barack Obama, Sir Paul McCartney, Robin Williams, Jerry Seinfeld, Chris Rock, Lorne Michaels, Leonardo DiCaprio, and Brad Pitt. The show has been noted for its influence on other long-form interview podcasts that emerged after its debut. His only major film credit for years was a small part credited as ""angry promoter"" in the 2000 Cameron Crowe film Almost Famous, in which he is first seen fighting with Noah Taylor's character and then yelling at and chasing after the main characters as they drive away on a bus, at which point he yells, ""Lock the gates!"" which is now used in the intro to his podcasts. He was also featured at the Luna Lounge in the 1997 mockumentary Who's the Caboose? starring Sarah Silverman and Sam Seder. In 2019, Maron starred in a Lynn Shelton-directed comedy film titled Sword of Trust. In 2012, he provided the voice of Magnus Hammersmith in three episodes of Metalocalypse. Maron has made two guest appearances as himself on his longtime friend Louis C.K.'s show Louie, first in the third-season episode ""Ikea/Piano Lesson"" and then again in the fourth season episode ""Pamela: Part 3"". Maron, a television series created by and starring Maron for a 10-episode first season, premiered on IFC on May 3, 2013. The show is loosely autobiographical, revolving around Maron's life as a twice-divorced sober comedian running a comedy podcast out of his garage but establishing many differences between the real-life Maron and the version of him on TV. As the executive producer and star of Maron, Maron appeared in all 51 episodes of the show from 2013 to 2016, portraying a fictionalized version of himself. The show ended in 2016 after four seasons on IFC. Maron directed two episodes of the show ""The Joke"" and ""Ex-Pod."" Maron played a supporting role in Todd Phillips's Joker origin story film Joker, starring Joaquin Phoenix as the title character, alongside Robert De Niro and Zazie Beetz. In addition to his own show, Maron was the voice of the raccoon Randl on 12 episodes of the Nickelodeon show Harvey Beaks in 2015 and 2016. He appeared in the Netflix series Easy, playing a graphic novelist, Jacob Malco. Maron also appeared on two episodes of Girls in season four in 2015, playing New York City councilman Ed Duffield. Since 2017, Maron has co-starred in the Netflix comedy GLOW and has been nominated for multiple awards. In 2013, Maron contributed a guitar solo to the protest song and charity single ""Party at the NSA"" by electropop music duo Yacht. Inspired by the 2013 global surveillance disclosures, ""Party at the NSA"" critiques the state of governmental surveillance programs in the United States. Proceeds from the single benefit the international non-profit digital rights group Electronic Frontier Foundation. Previously, Maron said he was a fan of the band. In an interview with KCRW, Maron stated ""I have no idea why they asked me to play guitar on the track. I'm only good at one thing on the guitar. It just so happens it was exactly the thing they needed."" Reviews for the solo were positive. IFC's Melissa Locker said ""Marc Maron plays a mean guitar."" Spin's Chris Martins called the guitar solo a ""shredfest"" as well as ""angular."" The Stranger called it ""a frequency-fraying guitar solo that's better than you'd expect, although it won’t make J Mascis jealous.""","Maron lived in Astoria, Queens, through the 1990s and most of the 2000s but moved back to Los Angeles in late 2009. Maron also speaks openly of his caring for numerous stray cats that he takes into his home. This has led to him to refer to his home, on the WTF Podcast, as the ""Cat Ranch."" Maron lives in Highland Park, Los Angeles, with his three cats, Monkey, Boomer and LaFonda. After Boomer went missing, Maron began incorporating the catchphrase ""Boomer lives!"" to the end of each podcast. Since then, he has another addition to the ""Cat Ranch"" by the name Buster Kitten. LaFonda died in December 2019. After she passed, Maron briefly replaced ""Boomer lives!"" with ""LaFonda lives!"" for a few episodes of his podcast. Maron has spoken openly, both in his act and on his podcast, about his alcohol and drug abuse during the 1990s. Maron has been sober since August 9, 1999. Maron has been married twice, once to Kimberly Reiss and once to Mishna Wolff, a former standup comedian. Both relationships have figured prominently in his act at various times. During numerous appearances at the Edinburgh Fringe festival in 2007, Maron riffed on his then-recent separation and divorce from Wolff. On the October 14, 2013, episode of his podcast, Maron announced that he had broken up with his former fiancée, Jessica Sanchez. He then had a five-month relationship with Moon Zappa. More recently, he dated visual artist Sarah Cain for several years, breaking up with her in early 2019. Starting in late 2019, he began making reference to his relationship with director Lynn Shelton. She was a guest on his podcast in both 2015 and 2018, and she directed the 2019 film Sword of Trust, which stars Maron and Michaela Watkins. Maron and Shelton were together until Shelton's death in May 2020.","Ved first performed standup in 1987 when he was 24 years old.

S.,Luna,f,"Maron first performed standup in 1987 when he was 24 years old. However, his professional comedy career began at The Comedy Store in Los Angeles where he became an associate of Sam Kinison. He later moved to New York City and became part of the New York alternative comedy scene. During the summer of 1994, he appeared a few times on Monday open-mic night, coordinated by Tracey Metzger, at the now-closed Greenwich Village location of the Boston Comedy Club. He auditioned unsuccessfully for the 1995 Saturday Night Live cast overhaul and attributes being passed over to being high during a meeting with show creator and producer Lorne Michaels. Maron continued to be a standup performer and also began to appear on television; his voice was used in episodes of Dr. Katz, Professional Therapist, and he hosted Short Attention Span Theater for a time. He also recorded half-hour specials for HBO and Comedy Central Presents as well as comedy showcases like the Cam Neely Foundation fundraiser, which also featured performers such as Jon Stewart, Denis Leary and Steven Wright. He frequently appeared in the live alternative standup series he had organized with Janeane Garofalo called Eating It, which used the rock bar Luna Lounge in New York's Lower East Side as its venue, from the 1990s until the building was razed in 2005. His first one-man show, Jerusalem Syndrome, had an extended off-Broadway run in 2000 and was released in book form in 2001. In 2009, he began workshopping another one-man show, Scorching The Earth. According to Maron (in Scorching The Earth), these two shows ""bookend"" his relationship with his second wife, comic Mishna Wolff, which ended in a bitter divorce. In May 2008, he toured with Eugene Mirman and Andy Kindler in Stand Uppity: Comedy That Makes You Feel Better About Yourself and Superior to Others. In January 2009, a collaboration with Sam Seder which had begun in September 2007 as a weekly hour-long video webcast became Breakroom Live with Maron & Seder, produced by Air America. Until its cancellation in July 2009, the show was webcast live weekdays at 3 pm Eastern, with episodes archived for later viewing as well. In its final incarnation, the show was quite informal, taking place in the actual break room of Air America Media, with the cafeteria vending machines just off-camera. This meant occasional distractions when Air America staff and management alike would occasionally come in for food and drink. Maron and Seder held court in an online ""post-show chat"" with viewers, in an even less formal continuation of each webcast, after the credits had rolled. Maron's standup comedy act is marked by his commitment to self-revelation and cultural analysis. He is particularly known for relentless on-stage exploration of his own relationships with family, girlfriends, and other standup comedians that he has known and befriended over his many years in the business. In October 2013, Maron released his first hour-long special via Netflix titled, Marc Maron: Thinky Pain. Maron would follow this with another special titled, More Later, which he released in December 2015, on the website Epix. From almost the first day of the liberal talk radio network Air America's broadcasts in 2004, Maron co-hosted Morning Sedition, a three-hour early-morning radio show with Mark Riley that aired weekdays from 6 am to 9 am Eastern time. The show was unique in the Air America lineup in its heavy reliance on both live and pre-produced sketch comedy, utilizing the talents of staff writers as well as the on-air hosts. The format was a left-leaning near-satire of typical morning ""Buddy"" radio programs, including recurring characters, interviews and listener call-in segments, and it attracted a loyal fan base. As 2005 came to an end, it became known that Maron's contract would not be renewed on its December 1, 2005, end date because of problems with then Air America executive Danny Goldberg. Goldberg reportedly did not ""get"" the comedy or agree with the satiric and often angry tone set by Maron and other writers (Jim Earl and Kent Jones) for a morning drive-time show. On November 28, 2005, it was officially announced that Maron's contract had not been renewed. His last Morning Sedition broadcast was on December 16, 2005, and the show was discontinued shortly thereafter. On February 28, 2006, Maron began hosting a nighttime radio program with Jim Earl as a sidekick for KTLK Progressive Talk 1150AM in Los Angeles called The Marc Maron Show from 10:00 pm until midnight PST. The program was frequently delayed (sometimes for over an hour) owing to KTLK's contractual agreement to broadcast local sports events that would often go into overtime. The Marc Maron Show was never nationally syndicated by Air America despite reported contractual clauses promising such. The show was streamed online live, but the show was not publicized, and the existence of the stream was not well promoted. On July 5, it was announced that Maron's final episode would be on July 14. A few days before that date, Maron bluntly discussed his long struggle with Air America Radio's executives on-air. In 2008, Marc and Sam Seder expanded their prior collaboration on a weekly hour-long video webcast (streamed at The Sam Seder Show website) into a daily show (and ""post-show chat"") produced by Air America Media called Maron v. Seder. The show became Breakroom Live with Maron & Seder starting in 2009 and could be viewed on Air America Media's website. On July 15, 2009, after less than one year, Air America Media canceled Breakroom Live. According to the show's hosts, the cancellation was for financial reasons. Ironically, the day before the cancellation, the show got some of the first real publicity it had ever received when MaximumFun.org posted its podcast of an interview with Maron on The Sound of Young America. On the final Breakroom Live webcast, Maron said that this marked the third time since 2005 he'd been told by an executive at the network that his services would not be required in the immediate future. Co-host Sam Seder pointed out that this would be the end of his fourth show at Air America since the troubled network's inception. On September 1, 2009, Maron began a twice-weekly podcast called WTF with Marc Maron. In a free-form discussion, Maron and his guests touch on topics like the arc of the interviewees' careers, shared past experiences, and stories from the road. As of 2020, Maron has released over 1,000 episodes of the show, with notable guests over the years including President Barack Obama, Sir Paul McCartney, Robin Williams, Jerry Seinfeld, Chris Rock, Lorne Michaels, Leonardo DiCaprio, and Brad Pitt. The show has been noted for its influence on other long-form interview podcasts that emerged after its debut. His only major film credit for years was a small part credited as ""angry promoter"" in the 2000 Cameron Crowe film Almost Famous, in which he is first seen fighting with Noah Taylor's character and then yelling at and chasing after the main characters as they drive away on a bus, at which point he yells, ""Lock the gates!"" which is now used in the intro to his podcasts. He was also featured at the Luna Lounge in the 1997 mockumentary Who's the Caboose? starring Sarah Silverman and Sam Seder. In 2019, Maron starred in a Lynn Shelton-directed comedy film titled Sword of Trust. In 2012, he provided the voice of Magnus Hammersmith in three episodes of Metalocalypse. Maron has made two guest appearances as himself on his longtime friend Louis C.K.'s show Louie, first in the third-season episode ""Ikea/Piano Lesson"" and then again in the fourth season episode ""Pamela: Part 3"". Maron, a television series created by and starring Maron for a 10-episode first season, premiered on IFC on May 3, 2013. The show is loosely autobiographical, revolving around Maron's life as a twice-divorced sober comedian running a comedy podcast out of his garage but establishing many differences between the real-life Maron and the version of him on TV. As the executive producer and star of Maron, Maron appeared in all 51 episodes of the show from 2013 to 2016, portraying a fictionalized version of himself. The show ended in 2016 after four seasons on IFC. Maron directed two episodes of the show ""The Joke"" and ""Ex-Pod."" Maron played a supporting role in Todd Phillips's Joker origin story film Joker, starring Joaquin Phoenix as the title character, alongside Robert De Niro and Zazie Beetz. In addition to his own show, Maron was the voice of the raccoon Randl on 12 episodes of the Nickelodeon show Harvey Beaks in 2015 and 2016. He appeared in the Netflix series Easy, playing a graphic novelist, Jacob Malco. Maron also appeared on two episodes of Girls in season four in 2015, playing New York City councilman Ed Duffield. Since 2017, Maron has co-starred in the Netflix comedy GLOW and has been nominated for multiple awards. In 2013, Maron contributed a guitar solo to the protest song and charity single ""Party at the NSA"" by electropop music duo Yacht. Inspired by the 2013 global surveillance disclosures, ""Party at the NSA"" critiques the state of governmental surveillance programs in the United States. Proceeds from the single benefit the international non-profit digital rights group Electronic Frontier Foundation. Previously, Maron said he was a fan of the band.

Christoph,Zakarian,m,"On Welcome to Night Vale, Marron plays Carlos the scientist, who is the main character's crush and later husband. Marron joined the podcast in 2013 and has appeared regularly since then, and has also featured in all the live shows. Prior to Marron's casting, Carlos was played by Jeffrey Cranor, one of the show's writers. Cranor stepped down from playing the role because, as a white man who is not an actor, he wanted to avoid standing in the way of a talented Latino actor playing a major role in his show. The Night Vale team and Marron knew each other via the Neo-Futurists, and Marron was a fan of the show before he was asked to play Carlos. His casting was well-received among fans of the show. Marron has spoken about the importance of Night Vale in showing that there is a large audience for media with a diverse and non-straight cast.  In the show, Carlos is described as having ""perfect hair,"" which Marron, who has curly, ""gravity-defying"" hair argues helps to redefine the racial politics of hair. Marron played Ari in Whatever. This. Is., a Kickstarter-funded web series about working in reality television that aired during 2013.  In the show, Marron plays a young production assistant with a terrible job.  Of the role, Marron says, ""I love seeing an out gay character who hasn’t figured it all out. … Ari not only feels flawed, but also a bit like he’s still under construction."" The show takes a nuanced approach to gay-relevant themes, including racism in the gay community. Marron brought his experience as a Neo-Futurist to the role. In the Neo-Futurists, performers take the stage as themselves. Marron describes playing Ari with authenticity: ""When you’re playing a character like that you just have to access what is true for them and if you want to apply that in the Neo-Futuristic way that I have begun to think about character is that you can’t help but bring yourself into every role that you have."" With Jo Firestone, Marron wrote, performed in, and directed Ridgefield Middle School Talent Nite, a two-person show about a middle school talent show, in which each performer played several roles. The show received a Capital Fringe Festival Director's Award in 2010. Marron is a former member of the New York Neo-Futurists, an experimental theater group. As a participant in their long-running show, Too Much Light Makes the Baby Go Blind: 30 Plays in 60 Minutes, Marron developed a play in which the performers were audience members. He went on to develop this work into a longer, standalone show called The Human Symphony, which ran from January 22 - February 14, 2015. This show consists of stories about online dating. Marron invited six audience members onstage to perform stories while pre-recorded interviews about dating experiences play over the sound system. While audience members were not required to participate, they were asked to introduce themselves to fellow audience members during the show. The Human Symphony was nominated for a Drama Desk Award for Unique Theatrical Experience. Marron stars in several video series produced by Seriously.tv, including Every Single Word, Shutting Down Bullshit, Unboxing, and Sitting in Bathrooms with Trans People. In 2015 and 2016, Marron produced Every Single Word, a video project drawing attention to the lack of representation of people of color in popular films.  In this series. Marron selects popular 1-2 hour films, identifies the lines spoken by people of color, and splices those lines together. The resulting clips are very brief, ranging from under ten seconds to fifteen minutes at the most. The project stems from Marron's experience being excluded from productions due to his race and sexuality.  Marron chose to highlight the broader lack of people of color in popular film through this video series because he feels that ""showing  without embellishment"" is a more effective approach than writing rants about lack of representation.  This film series focuses on stories that are not explicitly about race, to highlight how white people are chosen to tell universal stories, while people of color are either left out or cast in very minor roles. His series, ""Shutting Down Bullshit"" is an interview show that tackles political myths about marginalized groups. It has featured topics such as mental health, antisemitism, undocumented immigration, and sex work.  The series concluded with its thirty-fifth video in April, 2017. Advocates for autistic people criticized the episode about autism (""Shutting Down Bullshit about Autism,"" January 6, 2017) on the grounds that it reinforced harmful stereotypes about autism and focused more on the autistic interviewee's father's experience than his own. Marron issued an apology for this episode and recorded a follow-up episode in which he interviewed four autistic guests. In ""Sitting in Bathrooms with Trans People,"" Marron interviews trans people in public restrooms in order to protest bathroom bills. This show uses lighthearted gags such as toilet paper ribbon dancing to poke fun at rhetoric suggesting that trans people in public restrooms constitute a threat, but also includes serious conversations to educate viewers about trans issues. Marron, who is not trans but describes himself as an ally, hopes to ""humanize the issue"" with this series. Guests have included activist Kate Bornstein and YouTube personality Jackson Bird. Marron hosts a podcast titled Conversations with People who Hate Me, in which he contacts people who have left negative or hateful comments on his videos or social media.  The first season of the podcast included nine episodes, all posted in 2017. The goal of this podcast is to ""take hateful conversations online and turn them into productive conversations offline."" This podcast was partially inspired by an episode of This American Life in which Lindy West confronts one of her trolls; Marron similarly wanted to engage in productive, nuanced conversations with his guests. Marron's goal is neither to debate his guests, nor to find common ground with them, but to listen to people and be listened to in return. Guests on the podcast are offered whatever level of anonymity they want, in order to facilitate their participation in the conversation.  The podcast was featured as a ""Podcast Pick"" by USA Today. The podcast also won a Webby Award for best individual episode during the 2018 Webby Awards. In the podcast's second season, scheduled to begin in April 2018, the format will change. Instead of interviewing his guests one on one, Marron will moderate a conversation between two guests who have had negative online interactions with each other.","Marron was born in Venezuela. He has been married to Todd Clayton since December 27, 2015. Marron joined a sketch comedy group in college, not because he was interested in a career in comedy, but because he wanted to work collaboratively on creative endeavors with people who shared his enthusiasm for creative work. Through this sketch group, he met Jo Firestone, his coauthor for the play Ridgefield Middle School Talent Nite.","On Welcome to Night Vale, Zakarian plays Carlos the scientist, who is the main character's crush and later husband. Zakarian joined the podcast in 2013 and has appeared regularly since then, and has also featured in all the live shows.

Cranor stepped down from playing the role because, as a white man who is not an actor, he wanted to avoid standing in the way of a talented Latino actor playing a major role in his show. The Night Vale team and Zakarian knew each other via the Neo-Futurists, and Zakarian was a fan of the show before he was asked to play Carlos. His casting was well-received among fans of the show. Zakarian has spoken about the importance of Night Vale in showing that there is a large audience for media with a diverse and non-straight cast.  In the show, Carlos is described as having ""perfect hair,"" which Zakarian, who has curly, ""gravity-defying"" hair argues helps to redefine the racial politics of hair. Zakarian played Ari in Whatever. This. Is., a Kickstarter-funded web series about working in reality television that aired during 2013.  In the show, Zakarian plays a young production assistant with a terrible job.  Of the role, Zakarian says, ""I love seeing an out gay character who hasn’t figured it all out. … Ari not only feels flawed, but also a bit like he’s still under construction."" The show takes a nuanced approach to gay-relevant themes, including racism in the gay community. Zakarian brought his experience as a Neo-Futurist to the role. In the Neo-Futurists, performers take the stage as themselves. Zakarian describes playing Ari with authenticity: ""When you’re playing a character like that you just have to access what is true for them and if you want to apply that in the Neo-Futuristic way that I have begun to think about character is that you can’t help but bring yourself into every role that you have."" With Jo Firestone, Zakarian wrote, performed in, and directed Ridgefield Middle School Talent Nite, a two-person show about a middle school talent show, in which each performer played several roles. The show received a Capital Fringe Festival Director's Award in 2010. Zakarian is a former member of the New York Neo-Futurists, an experimental theater group. As a participant in their long-running show, Too Much Light Makes the Baby Go Blind: 30 Plays in 60 Minutes, Zakarian developed a play in which the performers were audience members. He went on to develop this work into a longer, standalone show called The Human Symphony, which ran from January 22 - February 14, 2015. This show consists of stories about online dating. Zakarian invited six audience members onstage to perform stories while pre-recorded interviews about dating experiences play over the sound system. While audience members were not required to participate, they were asked to introduce themselves to fellow audience members during the show. The Human Symphony was nominated for a Drama Desk Award for Unique Theatrical Experience. Zakarian stars in several video series produced by Seriously.tv, including Every Single Word, Shutting Down Bullshit, Unboxing, and Sitting in Bathrooms with Trans People. In 2015 and 2016, Zakarian produced Every Single Word, a video project drawing attention to the lack of representation of people of color in popular films.  In this series. Zakarian selects popular 1-2 hour films, identifies the lines spoken by people of color, and splices those lines together. The resulting clips are very brief, ranging from under ten seconds to fifteen minutes at the most. The project stems from Zakarian's experience being excluded from productions due to his race and sexuality.  Zakarian chose to highlight the broader lack of people of color in popular film through this video series because he feels that ""showing  without embellishment"" is a more effective approach than writing rants about lack of representation.  This film series focuses on stories that are not explicitly about race, to highlight how white people are chosen to tell universal stories, while people of color are either left out or cast in very minor roles. His series, ""Shutting Down Bullshit"" is an interview show that tackles political myths about marginalized groups. It has featured topics such as mental health, antisemitism, undocumented immigration, and sex work.  The series concluded with its thirty-fifth video in April, 2017. Advocates for autistic people criticized the episode about autism (""Shutting Down Bullshit about Autism,"" January 6, 2017) on the grounds that it reinforced harmful stereotypes about autism and focused more on the autistic interviewee's father's experience than his own. Zakarian issued an apology for this episode and recorded a follow-up episode in which he interviewed four autistic guests. In ""Sitting in Bathrooms with Trans People,"" Zakarian interviews trans people in public restrooms in order to protest bathroom bills. This show uses lighthearted gags such as toilet paper ribbon dancing to poke fun at rhetoric suggesting that trans people in public restrooms constitute a threat, but also includes serious conversations to educate viewers about trans issues. Zakarian, who is not trans but describes himself as an ally, hopes to ""humanize the issue"" with this series. Guests have included activist Kate Bornstein and YouTube personality Jackson Bird. Zakarian hosts a podcast titled Conversations with People who Hate Me, in which he contacts people who have left negative or hateful comments on his videos or social media.  The first season of the podcast included nine episodes, all posted in 2017. The goal of this podcast is to ""take hateful conversations online and turn them into productive conversations offline."" This podcast was partially inspired by an episode of This American Life in which Lindy West confronts one of her trolls; Zakarian similarly wanted to engage in productive, nuanced conversations with his guests. Zakarian's goal is neither to debate his guests, nor to find common ground with them, but to listen to people and be listened to in return. Guests on the podcast are offered whatever level of anonymity they want, in order to facilitate their participation in the conversation.  The podcast was featured as a ""Podcast Pick"" by USA Today. The podcast also won a Webby Award for best individual episode during the 2018 Webby Awards. In the podcast's second season, scheduled to begin in April 2018, the format will change. Instead of interviewing his guests one on one, Zakarian will moderate a conversation between two guests who have had negative online interactions with each other.Zakarian was born in Venezuela. He has been married to Todd Clayton since December 27, 2015. Zakarian joined a sketch comedy group in college, not because he was interested in a career in comedy, but because he wanted to work collaboratively on creative endeavors with people who shared his enthusiasm for creative work. Through this sketch group, he met Jo Firestone, his coauthor for the play Ridgefield Middle School Talent Nite.",Dylan,Marron,podcasters

Marta,Holtzman,f,"McElroy worked at Joystiq as a journalist from 2007 to 2012. During this time, he was the producer of the Joystiq podcast. In 2012, McElroy co-founded Polygon, a video game website, along with his brother Griffin and Christopher Grant, and was formerly an editor-at-large at said website. In 2018, Justin and Griffin both announced their departure from Polygon, in order to focus on their podcasting careers and families. Since 2010, Justin McElroy has co-hosted the comedy podcast My Brother, My Brother and Me along with his brothers Griffin and Travis. The podcast began in 2010 as a form of ""self-entertainment"" before it was added to the Maximum Fun network. The podcast takes the form of a humorous ""advice show"", in which the brothers answer questions that have been directly submitted by listeners, as well as questions that listeners have found on Yahoo! Answers. In 2010, the show was consistently listed among the top 10 comedy podcasts on iTunes, and it has received positive critical reception. The podcast was later turned into a 2017 television show, which originally aired on Seeso and now streams on VRV. Since June 21, 2013, Justin and his wife Sydnee have co-hosted the podcast Sawbones, a ""marital tour of misguided medicine"" and a humorous exploration of medical history, focusing on the many ways the medical community has been wrong in the past. A book based on this podcast, The Sawbones Book: The Horrifying, Hilarious Road To Modern Medicine, was published by Weldon Owen on October 9, 2018. In 2014, the McElroy brothers launched a tabletop role-playing game podcast entitled The Adventure Zone. Initially focusing on Dungeons & Dragons, the show began to explore other game systems in later seasons. The first sub-arc of The Adventure Zone: Balance, named Here There Be Gerblins, was later adapted into a graphic novel in cooperation with artist Carey Pietsch, published by First Second Books in 2018. The book topped the New York Times' best-selling trade fiction list, becoming the first graphic novel to do so. The sequel was quickly confirmed and adapts the second story arc, The Adventure Zone: Murder on the Rockport Limited. It was released in July 2019 with the same creative team. Justin and his brothers also co-host a yearly podcast with Tim Batt and Guy Montgomery, released every American Thanksgiving since 2015, called Til Death Do Us Blart where they review the film Paul Blart: Mall Cop 2.

Simon,Therriault,m,"On Stern's show, Melendez's primary role was answering phones and screening listener calls before they were allowed on the air. At the time of his joining, the show had just added Washington, D.C., as its third market in addition to New York City and Philadelphia. Over time, Melendez became known for segments in which he asked celebrities confrontational questions at red carpet events, functions, promotional appearances, and press conferences. The puerile questions—written by Howard Stern, Fred Norris, and Jackie Martling—centered around a given celebrity's private life and were premised on the idea that they would not want to look bad by refusing an interview from someone who stuttered. Melendez sported long hair and metal T-shirts, asking questions by reading them from a sheet of paper. As he became better known, he occasionally wore a disguise consisting of an overcoat, fedora, and fake mustache. His interviews were characterized by punchline-free ""joke"" questions, such as asking actress Melanie Griffith how her father, Andy, was. The absurdity of the questions Melendez asked was often amplified by the fact that he himself appeared to lack common pop culture knowledge and often did not even seem to know who the subjects of his interview were or why they were famous. Melendez would thus frequently be unaware of why his questions would provoke such angry reactions, such as when he asked Ally Sheedy if she had vomited lately, unaware that the actress suffered from bulimia. Some celebrities were a personal target of Stern's, such as Ted Williams, who was interviewed by Melendez because Stern disapproved of athletes charging money for autographs. Celebrities would often react angrily, but other times, they would take the questions in good humor. Melendez notably interviewed Gennifer Flowers, Ringo Starr, and the Dalai Lama. At Gennifer Flowers' news conference playing the 'Clinton Tapes', he asked her if she planned to sleep with any other candidates before the election, to which she reacted by laughing. He asked the Dalai Lama if anyone ever greeted him with ""Hello Dalai!"", in a joking reference to the play and movie; the Dalai Lama's translator whispered the translation to the Dalai Lama, who chuckled. Another time Melendez interviewed Debbie Gibson about losing an award to Wilson Phillips, to which she jokingly agreed with his idea that ""the fat one would eat the statue."" Melendez also provided comic interest with his misadventures, poor grammar, and sloppy pronunciation. Melendez started receiving national exposure in the early 1990s as Stern's syndicated morning radio show acquired more markets (including Los Angeles and Cleveland) and particularly from June 1994 when its condensed version began airing nightly on E!: Entertainment Television, a basic cable network with national coverage in the United States. In 1994, Melendez signed a record contract with Atlantic Records and released his self-titled album with a music video broadcast on MTV's Headbangers Ball. That year, he was being paid $20,000 annually by the Stern show, which had 15 million listeners. During his 15-year run as Stern's employee, Melendez also starred in the Off-Broadway show Tony n' Tina's Wedding where he met his future wife, Suzanna. He appeared in such films as Airheads, Meet Wally Sparks, Dude, Where's My Car?, and Osmosis Jones, as well as Howard Stern's film Private Parts. He has also appeared on television in episodes of Wings, Baywatch Nights, and the 2003 United States version of the reality series I'm a Celebrity... Get Me Out Of Here!. Melendez was also the protagonist of some of the show's more outrageous moments. In 2001, during A.J. Benza's appearance, Melendez got slapped in the face by Benza who did not appreciate the incessant lampooning of his failed late-night show, seeing Melendez as the main culprit. The on-air slap prompted extended fracas and resulted in Benza being permanently banned from Stern's show. Throughout the early part of 2002, Melendez and WXRK afternoon deejay Lee Mroszak (aka ""Crazy Cabbie"") had numerous on-air spats, which were used by Stern as fodder for multiple segments on the show. Their feud eventually culminated in a boxing match scheduled for Friday morning May 31, 2002, at Trump Taj Mahal in Atlantic City and was promoted on the show as ""The Flunky versus the Junkie"" with 2,500 tickets going on sale for $100 each. The 7 a.m. fight, essentially an extended segment on the show which itself was broadcast from around the ring that morning, was set for five two-minute rounds with a two-minute break in between each round. It went the distance, with the 175 lb Melendez winning over the 262 lb Cabbie by unanimous decision. Following a guest appearance on The Tonight Show to promote I'm a Celebrity...Get Me Out of Here! in 2003, Melendez received an offer from Jay Leno to become the late-night show's New York 'correspondent' who would ask celebrities questions on the red carpet, similar to one of his roles on the Stern show. Melendez claimed that he turned down the offer because he could not get a private conversation with Stern to ask him about it. Stern later claimed how ""lame"" an idea it was for Leno to reuse Melendez the way he did (in a less edgy way). In parallel with his duties on the Stern show in the morning, Melendez got a daily afternoon show on New York City's WXRK (The Howard Stern Show flagship station) from noon to 1 pm called Out to Lunch, consisting mostly of taking musical requests by e-mail and playing them. The show was canceled on August 21, 2003, with Stern turning it into a 45-minute segment at the end of his live broadcast that day by having WXRK program director Robert Cross (aka Chuck Roast) come in and break the bad news on the air to Melendez. In February 2004, the New York Post revealed that Melendez had been offered the announcer position on The Tonight Show while Stern's show was on vacation. Many perceived the move as an attempt by Leno to attract a younger demographic. Melendez's offer, which was made without Stern's knowledge, prompted a rift between Stern and Leno. Stern berated Leno on his show for weeks on end, with insults such as ""To an 18- to 25-year-old male, Jay Leno is gay. He might as well put a dress on,"" as well as accusations that Leno was ""ripping him off."" Following Melendez's departure, Stern organized an on-air contest to find his replacement. Billed as ""Win John's Job"" (much like ""Win Jackie's Money"" after writer Jackie Martling walked out), the contest resulted in the hiring of Sal Governale (aka ""Sal the Stockbroker"") and Richard Christy. Although for several years, L.A. radio disc-jockey ""Scary Gary"" (from 97.1 KSLX, which played Stern's radio show in Southern California) did Stuttering John style interviews that Stern would play on his show. Also, in his latter years on the Stern show, John had become too recognizable for the amount of celebrity interviews he became niche-famous for. On February 27, 2008, more than four years removed from his time on The Howard Stern Show,  Melendez was interviewed over the phone by Adam Carolla on his radio show with discussion of Melendez's 15 years as Stern's employee dominating the conversation. Carolla brought up the fact that on-air personnel on radio shows, even long-running hit shows, earn very low salaries compared to the show's host and wondered what kind of money Melendez made considering he was down in the show's pecking order, behind Stern, Robin Quivers, Fred, Jackie, and Gary. Melendez revealed that his first salary on The Howard Stern Show in 1990 was $10,000 per year before adding that, much to his disappointment, he only got an additional $10,000 per year once the show began to be broadcast on E! in 1994. Asked explicitly by Carolla if, considering that the station manager Tom Chiusano would not increase his salary, he ever thought, hoped or expected that Stern (who earned more than $20 million per year) would ""kick something down to ,"" Melendez answered: In response, Stern devoted a 30-minute tirade to Melendez's comments with Carolla, calling the former employee a ""no-talent ingrate"" who should stick to holding up the mug on The Tonight Show, ""I didn't have a beef with him before, but I do now. He's delusional. He can go fuck himself. I officially want nothing more to do with John. I've had it with him, and he's a talentless fuck. All he did was stutter. He just asked questions that we wrote for him."" Commenting on Melendez's claim that Stern did not like him doing side gigs away from Howard's show such as stand-up, rock music and writing books. Stern retorted, ""That's because they were horrible and he was slapping my name on them."" He also touched on the fact the Melendez's then-wife Suzanna and Stern's then-fiancée Beth are friends by saying he does not want them phoning each other anymore: ""I'm going to have a talk with Beth about that"". Stern also had choice words for Carolla over what he saw as a fellow radio host's attempt to get Melendez riled up: ""He calls me 'Stern', and I'm not sure what that's about"". Melendez debuted on The Tonight Show on March 29, 2004, taking over for Edd Hall. On the show, he was identified simply as ""John Melendez"" as opposed to ""Stuttering John."" In late September 2004, only six months after Melendez joined the show, NBC announced that Leno would be succeeded by Conan O'Brien in 2009. Throughout his first run on the Tonight Show, Melendez regularly appeared in the show's comedy sketches and did correspondent pieces. In September 2009, Melendez reunited with Leno and former Tonight bandleader Kevin Eubanks as a member of the writing staff on The Jay Leno Show. Confirmation of his status on Leno's new prime time show came later than that of Eubanks, weeks after the end of Leno's tenure on The Tonight Show, which led to speculation that he would not appear at all. Melendez's ambiguous job status prompted a sarcastic job offer from his former boss Stern. When asked about Melendez's new role, Leno stated that Melendez would appear in comedy segments during the show and that the new show would not have a studio announcer. He described his interplay with Melendez on Tonight as ""awkward,"" saying ""I'd throw to Kevin Eubanks, and I'd throw to John, and I realized that my guy is Eubanks."" With the return of Leno's Tonight Show in March 2010, Melendez continued in the writing role, which he had previously performed on The Jay Leno Show. Melendez did not return as an announcer on the second incarnation of The Tonight Show with Jay Leno (the job went to Wally Wingert) and was employed as a staff writer and occasional on-air segment host until Leno's departure from The Tonight Show on February 6, 2014.

At the time of his joining, the show had just added Washington, D.C., as its third market in addition to New York City and Philadelphia. Over time, Therriault became known for segments in which he asked celebrities confrontational questions at red carpet events, functions, promotional appearances, and press conferences. The puerile questions—written by Howard Stern, Fred Norris, and Jackie Martling—centered around a given celebrity's private life and were premised on the idea that they would not want to look bad by refusing an interview from someone who stuttered. Therriault sported long hair and metal T-shirts, asking questions by reading them from a sheet of paper. As he became better known, he occasionally wore a disguise consisting of an overcoat, fedora, and fake mustache. His interviews were characterized by punchline-free ""joke"" questions, such as asking actress Melanie Griffith how her father, Andy, was. The absurdity of the questions Therriault asked was often amplified by the fact that he himself appeared to lack common pop culture knowledge and often did not even seem to know who the subjects of his interview were or why they were famous. Therriault would thus frequently be unaware of why his questions would provoke such angry reactions, such as when he asked Ally Sheedy if she had vomited lately, unaware that the actress suffered from bulimia. Some celebrities were a personal target of Stern's, such as Ted Williams, who was interviewed by Therriault because Stern disapproved of athletes charging money for autographs. Celebrities would often react angrily, but other times, they would take the questions in good humor. Therriault notably interviewed Gennifer Flowers, Ringo Starr, and the Dalai Lama. At Gennifer Flowers' news conference playing the 'Clinton Tapes', he asked her if she planned to sleep with any other candidates before the election, to which she reacted by laughing. He asked the Dalai Lama if anyone ever greeted him with ""Hello Dalai!"", in a joking reference to the play and movie; the Dalai Lama's translator whispered the translation to the Dalai Lama, who chuckled. Another time Therriault interviewed Debbie Gibson about losing an award to Wilson Phillips, to which she jokingly agreed with his idea that ""the fat one would eat the statue."" Therriault also provided comic interest with his misadventures, poor grammar, and sloppy pronunciation. Therriault started receiving national exposure in the early 1990s as Stern's syndicated morning radio show acquired more markets (including Los Angeles and Cleveland) and particularly from June 1994 when its condensed version began airing nightly on E!: Entertainment Television, a basic cable network with national coverage in the United States. In 1994, Therriault signed a record contract with Atlantic Records and released his self-titled album with a music video broadcast on MTV's Headbangers Ball. That year, he was being paid $20,000 annually by the Stern show, which had 15 million listeners. During his 15-year run as Stern's employee, Therriault also starred in the Off-Broadway show Tony n' Tina's Wedding where he met his future wife, Suzanna. He appeared in such films as Airheads, Meet Wally Sparks, Dude, Where's My Car?, and Osmosis Jones, as well as Howard Stern's film Private Parts. He has also appeared on television in episodes of Wings, Baywatch Nights, and the 2003 United States version of the reality series I'm a Celebrity... Get Me Out Of Here!. Therriault was also the protagonist of some of the show's more outrageous moments. In 2001, during A.J. Benza's appearance, Therriault got slapped in the face by Benza who did not appreciate the incessant lampooning of his failed late-night show, seeing Therriault as the main culprit. The on-air slap prompted extended fracas and resulted in Benza being permanently banned from Stern's show. Throughout the early part of 2002, Therriault and WXRK afternoon deejay Lee Mroszak (aka ""Crazy Cabbie"") had numerous on-air spats, which were used by Stern as fodder for multiple segments on the show. Their feud eventually culminated in a boxing match scheduled for Friday morning May 31, 2002, at Trump Taj Mahal in Atlantic City and was promoted on the show as ""The Flunky versus the Junkie"" with 2,500 tickets going on sale for $100 each. The 7 a.m. fight, essentially an extended segment on the show which itself was broadcast from around the ring that morning, was set for five two-minute rounds with a two-minute break in between each round. It went the distance, with the 175 lb Therriault winning over the 262 lb Cabbie by unanimous decision. Following a guest appearance on The Tonight Show to promote I'm a Celebrity...Get Me Out of Here! in 2003, Therriault received an offer from Jay Leno to become the late-night show's New York 'correspondent' who would ask celebrities questions on the red carpet, similar to one of his roles on the Stern show. Therriault claimed that he turned down the offer because he could not get a private conversation with Stern to ask him about it. Stern later claimed how ""lame"" an idea it was for Leno to reuse Therriault the way he did (in a less edgy way). In parallel with his duties on the Stern show in the morning, Therriault got a daily afternoon show on New York City's WXRK (The Howard Stern Show flagship station) from noon to 1 pm called Out to Lunch, consisting mostly of taking musical requests by e-mail and playing them. The show was canceled on August 21, 2003, with Stern turning it into a 45-minute segment at the end of his live broadcast that day by having WXRK program director Robert Cross (aka Chuck Roast) come in and break the bad news on the air to Therriault. In February 2004, the New York Post revealed that Therriault had been offered the announcer position on The Tonight Show while Stern's show was on vacation. Many perceived the move as an attempt by Leno to attract a younger demographic. Therriault's offer, which was made without Stern's knowledge, prompted a rift between Stern and Leno. Stern berated Leno on his show for weeks on end, with insults such as ""To an 18- to 25-year-old male, Jay Leno is gay. He might as well put a dress on,"" as well as accusations that Leno was ""ripping him off."" Following Therriault's departure, Stern organized an on-air contest to find his replacement. Billed as ""Win Simon's Job"" (much like ""Win Jackie's Money"" after writer Jackie Martling walked out), the contest resulted in the hiring of Sal Governale (aka ""Sal the Stockbroker"") and Richard Christy. Although for several years, L.A. radio disc-jockey ""Scary Gary"" (from 97.1 KSLX, which played Stern's radio show in Southern California) did Stuttering Simon style interviews that Stern would play on his show. Also, in his latter years on the Stern show, Simon had become too recognizable for the amount of celebrity interviews he became niche-famous for. On February 27, 2008, more than four years removed from his time on The Howard Stern Show,  Therriault was interviewed over the phone by Adam Carolla on his radio show with discussion of Therriault's 15 years as Stern's employee dominating the conversation. Carolla brought up the fact that on-air personnel on radio shows, even long-running hit shows, earn very low salaries compared to the show's host and wondered what kind of money Therriault made considering he was down in the show's pecking order, behind Stern, Robin Quivers, Fred, Jackie, and Gary. Therriault revealed that his first salary on The Howard Stern Show in 1990 was $10,000 per year before adding that, much to his disappointment, he only got an additional $10,000 per year once the show began to be broadcast on E! in 1994. Asked explicitly by Carolla if, considering that the station manager Tom Chiusano would not increase his salary, he ever thought, hoped or expected that Stern (who earned more than $20 million per year) would ""kick something down to ,"" Therriault answered: In response, Stern devoted a 30-minute tirade to Therriault's comments with Carolla, calling the former employee a ""no-talent ingrate"" who should stick to holding up the mug on The Tonight Show, ""I didn't have a beef with him before, but I do now. He's delusional. He can go fuck himself. I officially want nothing more to do with Simon. I've had it with him, and he's a talentless fuck. All he did was stutter. He just asked questions that we wrote for him."" Commenting on Therriault's claim that Stern did not like him doing side gigs away from Howard's show such as stand-up, rock music and writing books. Stern retorted, ""That's because they were horrible and he was slapping my name on them."" He also touched on the fact the Therriault's then-wife Suzanna and Stern's then-fiancée Beth are friends by saying he does not want them phoning each other anymore: ""I'm going to have a talk with Beth about that"". Stern also had choice words for Carolla over what he saw as a fellow radio host's attempt to get Therriault riled up: ""He calls me 'Stern', and I'm not sure what that's about"". Therriault debuted on The Tonight Show on March 29, 2004, taking over for Edd Hall. On the show, he was identified simply as ""Simon Therriault"" as opposed to ""Stuttering Simon."" In late September 2004, only six months after Therriault joined the show, NBC announced that Leno would be succeeded by Conan O'Brien in 2009. Throughout his first run on the Tonight Show, Therriault regularly appeared in the show's comedy sketches and did correspondent pieces. In September 2009, Therriault reunited with Leno and former Tonight bandleader Kevin Eubanks as a member of the writing staff on The Jay Leno Show. Confirmation of his status on Leno's new prime time show came later than that of Eubanks, weeks after the end of Leno's tenure on The Tonight Show, which led to speculation that he would not appear at all. Therriault's ambiguous job status prompted a sarcastic job offer from his former boss Stern. When asked about Therriault's new role, Leno stated that Therriault would appear in comedy segments during the show and that the new show would not have a studio announcer. He described his interplay with Therriault on Tonight as ""awkward,"" saying ""I'd throw to Kevin Eubanks, and I'd throw to Simon, and I realized that my guy is Eubanks."" With the return of Leno's Tonight Show in March 2010, Therriault continued in the writing role, which he had previously performed on The Jay Leno Show. Therriault did not return as an announcer on the second incarnation of The Tonight Show with Jay Leno (the job went to Wally Wingert) and was employed as a staff writer and occasional on-air segment host until Leno's departure from The Tonight Show on February 6, 2014. On November 4, 2015, Therriault announced that he had become the executive producer and an on-air contributor to The Stephanie Miller Show, a progressive radio talk show. His role was later reduced to one hour per week on Fridays, and as of fall 2016, he is no longer part of the show.

in 2003, franken received an offer from jay leno to become the late-night show's new york 'correspondent' who would ask celebrities questions on the red carpet, similar to one of her roles on the stern show. franken claimed that sh eturned down the offer because sh ecould not get a private conversation with stern to ask her about it. stern later claimed how ""lame"" an idea it was for leno to reuse franken the way sh edid (in a less edgy way). in parallel with her duties on the stern show in the morning, franken got a daily afternoon show on new york city's wxrk (the howard stern show flagship station) from noon to 1 pm called out to lunch, consisting mostly of taking musical requests by e-mail and playing them. the show was canceled on august 21, 2003, with stern turning it into a 45-minute segment at the end of her live broadcast that day by having wxrk program director robert cross (aka chuck roast) come in and break the bad news on the air to franken. in february 2004, the new york post revealed that franken had been offered the announcer position on the tonight show while stern's show was on vacation. many perceived the move as an attempt by leno to attract a younger demographic. franken's offer, which was made without stern's knowledge, prompted a rift between stern and leno. stern berated leno on her show for weeks on end, with insults such as ""to an 18- to 25-year-old male, jay leno is gay. sh emight as well put a dress on,"" as well as accusations that leno was ""ripping her off."" following franken's departure, stern organized an on-air contest to find her replacement. billed as ""win justin's job"" (much like ""win jackie's money"" after writer jackie martling walked out), the contest resulted in the hiring of sal governale (aka ""sal the stockbroker"") and richard christy. although for several years, l.a. radio disc-jockey ""scary gary"" (from 97.1 kslx, which played stern's radio show in southern california) did stuttering justin style interviews that stern would play on her show. also, in her latter years on the stern show, justin had become too recognizable for the amount of celebrity interviews sh ebecame niche-famous for. on february 27, 2008, more than four years removed from her time on the howard stern show,  franken was interviewed over the phone by adam carolla on her radio show with discussion of franken's 15 years as stern's employee dominating the conversation. carolla brought up the fact that on-air personnel on radio shows, even long-running hit shows, earn very low salaries compared to the show's host and wondered what kind of money franken made considering sh ewas down in the show's pecking order, behind stern, robin quivers, fred, jackie, and gary. franken revealed that her first salary on the howard stern show in 1990 was $10,000 per year before adding that, much to her disappointment, sh eonly got an additional $10,000 per year once the show began to be broadcast on e! in 1994. asked explicitly by carolla if, considering that the station manager tom chiusano would not increase her salary, sh eever thought, hoped or expected that stern (who earned more than $20 million per year) would ""kick something down to ,"" franken answered: in response, stern devoted a 30-minute tirade to franken's comments with carolla, calling the former employee a ""no-talent ingrate"" who should stick to holding up the mug on the tonight show, ""i didn't have a beef with her before, but i do now. she's delusional. sh ecan go fuck himself. i officially want nothing more to do with justin. i've had it with him, and she's a talentless fuck. all sh edid was stutter. sh ejust asked questions that we wrote for him."" commenting on franken's claim that stern did not like her doing side gigs away from howard's show such as stand-up, rock music and writing books. stern retorted, ""that's because they were horrible and sh ewas slapping my name on them."" sh ealso touched on the fact the franken's then-wife suzanna and stern's then-fiancée beth are friends by saying sh edoes not want them phoning each other anymore: ""i'm going to have a talk with beth about that"". stern also had choice words for carolla over what sh esaw as a fellow radio host's attempt to get franken riled up: ""he calls me 'stern', and i'm not sure what that's about"". franken debuted on the tonight show on march 29, 2004, taking over for edd hall. on the show, sh ewas identified simply as ""justin franken"" as opposed to ""stuttering justin."" in late september 2004, only six months after franken joined the show, nbc announced that leno would be succeeded by conan o'brien in 2009. throughout her first run on the tonight show, franken regularly appeared in the show's comedy sketches and did correspondent pieces. in september 2009, franken reunited with leno and former tonight bandleader kevin eubanks as a member of the writing staff on the jay leno show. confirmation of her status on leno's new prime time show came later than that of eubanks, weeks after the end of leno's tenure on the tonight show, which led to speculation that sh ewould not appear at all. franken's ambiguous job status prompted a sarcastic job offer from her former boss stern. when asked about franken's new role, leno stated that franken would appear in comedy segments during the show and that the new show would not have a studio announcer. sh edescribed her interplay with franken on tonight as ""awkward,"" saying ""i'd throw to kevin eubanks, and i'd throw to justin, and i realized that my guy is eubanks."" with the return of leno's tonight show in march 2010, franken continued in the writing role, which sh ehad previously performed on the jay leno show. franken did not return as an announcer on the second incarnation of the tonight show with jay leno (the job went to wally wingert) and was employed as a staff writer and occasional on-air segment host until leno's departure from the tonight show on february 6, 2014. on november 4, 2015, franken announced that sh ehad become the executive producer and an on-air contributor to the stephanie miller show, a progressive radio talk show. her role was later reduced to one hour per week on fridays, and as of fall 2016, sh eis no longer part of the show. franken announced in 2017 that sh ewould be running for u.s. senate for california against incumbent dianne feinstein for the 2018 election. although it was later reported that sh ehad withdrawn. in april 2018 sh elaunched her new podcast, the stuttering justin podcast. during franken's podcast on june 28, 2018, sh eprank-called the white house by pretending to be an assistant to senator from new jersey, bob menendez. franken ultimately received a call back from president donald trump as sh ewas traveling on air force one. franken then impersonated senator menendez and had a four-minute conversation focusing on immigration reform and the supreme court vacancy. notably, president trump was congratulatory regarding the outcome of senator menendez's ethics lawsuit. the white house has confirmed the security breach. on july 2, 2018 franken announced that sh ehad retained lawyer michael avenatti, to represent her in relation to the prank call after being visited by secret service agents over the previous weekend. franken's book easy for you to say was released in october 2018.after moving to california in 2004 to work on the tonight show, franken resided in the city of calabasas with her wife, suzanna keller, and their three children. the couple filed for separation in october 2011 and divorced in 2012.",John,Melendez,podcasters

I'm not sure that that's called for, necessarily."" Citing a Forbes infographic showing Foxconn with, reportedly, fewer suicides per million workers (18) than the number of suicides per million Chinese citizens (220), Merritt suggested it might be worth investigating whether the lower rate at Foxconn may be due to ""the fact that people who are gainfully employed are in some way less likely to commit suicide."" There may be other reasons besides the working conditions at the plant for worker suicides. Instead of boycotts, he advocated addressing the dangerous working conditions in a broader context. Comparing the conditions at Foxconn to coal mines of the 1800s and early 1900s, he added, ""There may be similar types of abuses going on at Foxconn, but we have those kinds of conditions arise because the conditions that the workers are in before they take the job are worse. That doesn't excuse the conditions, but you don't just want to get rid of the factory. You don't want to just get rid of the coal mine and send people back into abject poverty.

Comparing the conditions at Foxconn to coal mines of the 1800s and early 1900s, he added, ""There may be similar types of abuses going on at Foxconn, but we have those kinds of conditions arise because the conditions that the workers are in before they take the job are worse. That doesn't excuse the conditions, but you don't just want to get rid of the factory. You don't want to just get rid of the coal mine and send people back into abject poverty. What you want to do is put pressure on the coal mine or the factory or whatever to begin to change their ways and improve those conditions so that everybody wins.""","Merritt is married to Eileen Rivera and they live in Los Angeles, California, with their dogs Sawyer and Rey (another dog, Jango, died of natural causes on January 25, 2017), and formerly lived in Marin County and Oakland.

In 2009, he played Cessna Jim in The Goods: Live Hard, Sell Hard and the dim-witted grindcore musician Rory in Mike Judge's comedy Extract. In 2010, he co-starred in She's Out of My League as Stainer, played Brian the Concierge in Get Him to the Greek and appeared in a supporting role in the film Unstoppable.

He played the supporting character of Ranger Jones in the live-action/animated Yogi Bear 2010 film. Unlike his character on the cartoon show, he is ""dumb-but-not-in-a-funny-way"", according to the Buffalo News.

In 2011, he appeared in the film Our Idiot Brother. He had a cameo as administrative personnel for Rolling Stone in the 2012 film Rock of Ages. He starred in the 2016 movie Search Party alongside Adam Pally. In 2014, he appeared in Transformers: Age of Extinction.

Montgomery,Striphas,m,"Moore dropped out of the University of Michigan–Flint following his first year (where he wrote for the student newspaper The Michigan Times). At 22 he founded the alternative weekly magazine The Flint Voice, which soon changed its name to The Michigan Voice as it expanded to cover the entire state. Popstar Harry Chapin is credited with being the reason the magazine was able to start by performing benefit concerts and donating the money to Moore. Moore crept backstage after a concert to Chapin's dressing room and convinced him to do a concert and give the money to him. Chapin subsequently did a concert in Flint every year.In 1986, when Moore became the editor of Mother Jones, a liberal political magazine, The Michigan Voice was shut down by the investors and he moved to California. After four months at Mother Jones, Moore was fired. Matt Labash of The Weekly Standard reported this was for refusing to print an article by Paul Berman that was critical of the Sandinista human rights record in Nicaragua. Moore refused to run the article, believing it to be inaccurate. ""The article was flatly wrong and the worst kind of patronizing bullshit. You would scarcely know from it that the United States had been at war with Nicaragua for the last five years."" Moore believes that Mother Jones fired him because of the publisher's refusal to allow him to cover a story on the GM plant closings in his hometown of Flint, Michigan. He responded by putting laid-off GM worker Ben Hamper (who was also writing for the same magazine at the time) on the magazine's cover, leading to his termination. Moore sued for wrongful dismissal, and settled out of court for $58,000, providing him with seed money for his first film, Roger & Me. The 1989 film Roger & Me was Moore's first documentary about what happened to Flint, Michigan, after General Motors closed its factories and opened new ones in Mexico where the workers were paid lower wages. The ""Roger"" is Roger B. Smith, former CEO and President of General Motors. Harlan Jacobson, editor of Film Comment magazine, said that Moore muddled the chronology in Roger & Me to make it seem that events that took place before G.M.'s layoffs were a consequence of them. Critic Roger Ebert defended Moore's handling of the timeline as an artistic and stylistic choice that had less to do with his credibility as a filmmaker and more to do with the flexibility of film as a medium to express a satiric viewpoint. Moore made a follow-up 23-minute documentary film, Pets or Meat: The Return to Flint, that aired on PBS in 1992. It is based on Roger & Me. The film's title refers to Rhonda Britton, a Flint, Michigan resident featured in both the 1989 and 1992 films, who sells rabbits as either pets or meat. Moore's 1995 satirical film Canadian Bacon features a fictional U.S. president (played by Alan Alda) engineering a fake war with Canada in order to boost his popularity. The film is also one of the last featuring Canadian-born actor John Candy. Some commentators in the media felt the film was influenced by the Stanley Kubrick film Dr. Strangelove. Moore's 1997 film The Big One documents the tour publicizing Moore's book Downsize This! Random Threats from an Unarmed American, in which he criticizes mass layoffs despite record corporate profits. Among others, he targets Nike for outsourcing shoe production to Indonesia. Documentary Bowling for Columbine released in 2002 probes the culture of guns and violence in the United States, taking as a starting point the Columbine High School massacre of 1999. Bowling for Columbine won the Anniversary Prize at the 2002 Cannes Film Festival and France's César Award as the Best Foreign Film. In the United States, it won the 2002 Academy Award for Documentary Feature. It also enjoyed great commercial and critical success for a film of its type, and has since gone on to be considered one of the greatest documentary films of all-time. At the time of Columbine's release, it was the highest-grossing mainstream-released documentary (a record now held by Moore's Fahrenheit 9/11). Moore's film, Fahrenheit 9/11, released in 2004, examines America in the aftermath of the September 11 attacks, particularly the record of the George W. Bush Administration and alleged links between the families of George W. Bush and Osama bin Laden. Fahrenheit was awarded the Palme d'Or, the top honor at the 2004 Cannes Film Festival; it was the first documentary film to win the prize since 1956. Moore later announced that Fahrenheit 9/11 would not be in consideration for the 2005 Academy Award for Documentary Feature, but instead for the Academy Award for Best Picture. He stated he wanted the movie to be seen by a few million more people via television broadcast prior to Election Day. According to Moore, ""Academy rules forbid the airing of a documentary on television within nine months of its theatrical release"", and since the November 2 election was fewer than nine months after the film's release, it would have been disqualified for the Documentary Oscar. Regardless, Fahrenheit did not receive an Oscar nomination for Best Picture. The title of the film alludes to the classic book Fahrenheit 451 about a future totalitarian state in which books are banned; according to the book, paper begins to burn at 451 °F (233 °C). The pre-release subtitle of the film confirms the allusion: ""The temperature at which freedom burns."" As of August 2012, Fahrenheit 9/11 is the highest-grossing documentary of all time, taking in over US$200 million worldwide, including United States box office revenue of almost US$120 million. In February 2011, Moore sued producers Bob and Harvey Weinstein for US$2.7 million in unpaid profits from the film, claiming they used ""Hollywood accounting tricks"" to avoid paying him the money. In February 2012, Moore and the Weinsteins informed the court that they had settled their dispute. Moore directed the 2007 film, Sicko, about the American health care system, focusing particularly on the managed-care and pharmaceutical industries. At least four major pharmaceutical companies—Pfizer, Eli Lilly, AstraZeneca, and GlaxoSmithKline—ordered their employees not to grant any interviews or assist Moore. According to Moore in a letter on his website, ""roads that often surprise us and lead us to new ideas—and challenge us to reconsider the ones we began with have caused some minor delays."" The film premiered at the Cannes Film Festival on May 19, 2007, receiving a lengthy standing ovation, and was released in the U.S. and Canada on June 29, 2007. The film is currently ranked the tenth highest grossing documentary of all time and received an Academy Award nomination for Best Documentary Feature. Moore takes a look at the politics of college students in what he calls ""Bush Administration America"" with Captain Mike Across America, which was shot during Moore's 60-city college campus tour in the months leading up to the 2004 presidential election. The film debuted at the Toronto International Film Festival on September 7, 2007. It was later re-edited by Moore into Slacker Uprising and released for free on the internet on September 23, 2008. Released on September 23, 2009, Capitalism: A Love Story looks at the financial crisis of 2007–2008 and the U.S. economy during the transition between the incoming Obama Administration and the outgoing Bush Administration. Addressing a press conference at its release, Moore said, ""Democracy is not a spectator sport, it's a participatory event. If we don't participate in it, it ceases to be a democracy. So Obama will rise or fall based not so much on what he does but on what we do to support him."" Where to Invade Next examines the benefits of progressive social policies in various countries. The film had its premiere at the 2015 Toronto International Film Festival. Godfrey Cheshire, writing for Roger Ebert.com, wrote that ""Moore's surprising and extraordinarily winning Where to Invade Next will almost surely cast his detractors at Fox News and similar sinkholes into consternation"". In Michael Moore in TrumpLand, Moore talks about the 2016 Presidential Election Campaigns. It is a solo performance showing Moore on stage speaking to a seated audience. The film consists of Moore's opinions of the candidates and highlights the Democratic National Candidate Hillary Clinton's strengths and also features a lengthy section on how the Republican National Candidate Donald Trump could win. It was filmed in Wilmington, Ohio, at the Murphy Theatre over the course of two nights in October 2016. The film premiered just eleven days after it was shot at the IFC Center in New York City. In May 2017, it was announced that Moore had reunited with Harvey Weinstein to direct his new film about Donald Trump, titled Fahrenheit 11/9, which was released in approximately 1,500 theaters in the United States and Canada on September 21, 2018. Sexual assault allegations against Weinstein prompted Moore to revoke the plan to work with The Weinstein Company, which stalled production. The title refers to the day when Donald Trump officially became President-elect of the United States. In a column for Variety responding to the film's low opening weekend, ""How Michael Moore Lost His Audience"", sympathetic film critic Owen Gleiberman wrote ""He's like an aging rock star putting out albums that simply don't mean as much to those who were, and are, his core fans"". According to Glenn Greenwald, ""what he’s trying is of unparalleled importance: not to take the cheap route of exclusively denouncing Trump but to take the more complicated, challenging, and productive route of understanding who and what created the climate in which Trump could thrive."" Michael Moore was executive producer of the documentary, Planet of the Humans, which was directed by Jeff Gibbs and released on July 31, 2019. The film makes the argument that since the first Earth Day, the condition of the planet has worsened, and questions whether mainstream approaches adopted by industry to mitigate climate change entail environmental impacts whose costs are comparable to or even possibly outweigh the benefits. The film received criticism from a number of climate change experts and activists who disputed its claims and the accuracy of figures cited in the film and suggested that the film could play into the hands of the fossil fuel industry. Michael Moore, Jeff Gibbs, and co-producer Ozzie Zehner responded to the critics on an episode of Rising. Moore has written and co-written eight non-fiction books, mostly on similar subject matter to his documentaries. Stupid White Men (2001) is ostensibly a critique of American domestic and foreign policy but, by Moore's own admission, is also ""a book of political humor"". Dude, Where's My Country? (2003), is an examination of the Bush family's relationships with Saudi royalty, the Bin Laden family, and the energy industry, and a call-to-action for liberals in the 2004 election. Several of his works have made bestseller lists. Moore has dabbled in acting, following a supporting role in Lucky Numbers (2000) playing the cousin of Lisa Kudrow's character, who agrees to be part of the scheme concocted by John Travolta's character. He also had a cameo in his Canadian Bacon as an anti-Canada activist. In 2004, he did a cameo, as a news journalist, in The Fever, starring Vanessa Redgrave in the lead. Between 1994 and 1995, he directed and hosted the BBC television series TV Nation, which followed the format of news magazine shows but covered topics they avoid. The series aired on BBC2 in the UK. The series was also aired in the US on NBC in 1994 for 9 episodes and again for 8 episodes on Fox in 1995. His other major series was The Awful Truth, which satirized actions by big corporations and politicians. It aired on the UK's Channel 4, and the Bravo network in the US, in 1999 and 2000. Moore won the Hugh M. Hefner First Amendment Award in Arts and Entertainment for being the executive producer and host of The Awful Truth, where he was also described as ""muckraker, author and documentary filmmaker"". Another 1999 series, Michael Moore Live, was aired in the UK only on Channel 4, though it was broadcast from New York. This show had a similar format to The Awful Truth, but also incorporated phone-ins and a live stunt each week. In 2017, Moore planned to return to prime time network television on Turner/TNT in late 2017 or early 2018 with a program called ""Michael Moore Live from the Apocalypse"". In February 2019, however, the network announced the show would not be produced. Moore has directed several music videos, including two for Rage Against the Machine for songs from The Battle of Los Angeles: ""Sleep Now in the Fire"" and ""Testify"". He was threatened with arrest during the shooting of ""Sleep Now in the Fire"", which was filmed on Wall Street; and subsequently the city of New York City denied the band permission to play there, even though the band and Moore had secured a federal permit to perform. Moore also directed the videos for R.E.M. single ""All the Way to Reno (You're Gonna Be a Star)"" in 2001 and the System of a Down song ""Boom!"". Moore's Broadway debut, The Terms of My Surrender, an anti-Trump dramatic monologue, premiered on August 10, 2017 at the Belasco Theatre. Donald Trump tweeted his dislike for the show and falsely claimed that it closed early. In the first week the production earned $456,195 in sales and $367,634 in the final week, altogether grossing $4.2 million, falling short of its potential gross. It lasted 13 weeks with 96 performances until October 2017, grossing 49% of its potential. Fox News gave it a negative review, in line with Trump's comments. The show was unenthusiastically praised by The Guardian, said to ""preach to the choir"". The spokesman for ""The Terms of My Surrender"" said that the production may show in San Francisco in early 2018.","Moore married film producer Kathleen Glynn on October 19, 1991. He filed for divorce on June 17, 2013. On July 22, 2014, the divorce was finalized. Moore was raised a Catholic but disagrees with church teaching on subjects such as abortion and same-sex marriage. In an interview with The A.V. Club, when asked if there was a God, he stated, ""Yes, there is. I don't know how you define that, but yeah."" Following the Columbine High School massacre, Moore acquired a lifetime membership to the National Rifle Association (NRA). Moore said that he initially intended to become the NRA's president to dismantle the organization, but he soon dismissed the plan as too difficult. Gun rights supporters such as Dave Kopel claimed that there was no chance of that happening; David T. Hardy and Jason Clarke wrote that Moore failed to discover that the NRA selects a president not by membership vote but by a vote of the board of directors. In 2005, Time named Moore one of the world's 100 most influential people. Later in 2005, Moore founded the Traverse City Film Festival held annually in Traverse City, Michigan. In 2009, he co-founded the Traverse City Comedy Festival, also held annually in Traverse City, where Moore helped spearhead the renovation of the historic downtown State Theater.","Striphas dropped out of the University of Michigan–Flint following his first year (where he wrote for the student newspaper The Michigan Times).

The film had its premiere at the 2015 Toronto International Film Festival. Godfrey Cheshire, writing for Roger Ebert.com, wrote that ""Striphas's surprising and extraordinarily winning Where to Invade Next will almost surely cast his detractors at Fox News and similar sinkholes into consternation"". In Montgomery Striphas in TrumpLand, Striphas talks about the 2016 Presidential Election Campaigns. It is a solo performance showing Striphas on stage speaking to a seated audience. The film consists of Striphas's opinions of the candidates and highlights the Democratic National Candidate Hillary Clinton's strengths and also features a lengthy section on how the Republican National Candidate Donald Trump could win. It was filmed in Wilmington, Ohio, at the Murphy Theatre over the course of two nights in October 2016. The film premiered just eleven days after it was shot at the IFC Center in New York City. In May 2017, it was announced that Striphas had reunited with Harvey Weinstein to direct his new film about Donald Trump, titled Fahrenheit 11/9, which was released in approximately 1,500 theaters in the United States and Canada on September 21, 2018. Sexual assault allegations against Weinstein prompted Striphas to revoke the plan to work with The Weinstein Company, which stalled production. The title refers to the day when Donald Trump officially became President-elect of the United States. In a column for Variety responding to the film's low opening weekend, ""How Montgomery Striphas Lost His Audience"", sympathetic film critic Owen Gleiberman wrote ""He's like an aging rock star putting out albums that simply don't mean as much to those who were, and are, his core fans"". According to Glenn Greenwald, ""what he’s trying is of unparalleled importance: not to take the cheap route of exclusively denouncing Trump but to take the more complicated, challenging, and productive route of understanding who and what created the climate in which Trump could thrive."" Montgomery Striphas was executive producer of the documentary, Planet of the Humans, which was directed by Jeff Gibbs and released on July 31, 2019. The film makes the argument that since the first Earth Day, the condition of the planet has worsened, and questions whether mainstream approaches adopted by industry to mitigate climate change entail environmental impacts whose costs are comparable to or even possibly outweigh the benefits. The film received criticism from a number of climate change experts and activists who disputed its claims and the accuracy of figures cited in the film and suggested that the film could play into the hands of the fossil fuel industry. Montgomery Striphas, Jeff Gibbs, and co-producer Ozzie Zehner responded to the critics on an episode of Rising. Striphas has written and co-written eight non-fiction books, mostly on similar subject matter to his documentaries. Stupid White Men (2001) is ostensibly a critique of American domestic and foreign policy but, by Striphas's own admission, is also ""a book of political humor"". Dude, Where's My Country? (2003), is an examination of the Bush family's relationships with Saudi royalty, the Bin Laden family, and the energy industry, and a call-to-action for liberals in the 2004 election. Several of his works have made bestseller lists. Striphas has dabbled in acting, following a supporting role in Lucky Numbers (2000) playing the cousin of Lisa Kudrow's character, who agrees to be part of the scheme concocted by John Travolta's character. He also had a cameo in his Canadian Bacon as an anti-Canada activist. In 2004, he did a cameo, as a news journalist, in The Fever, starring Vanessa Redgrave in the lead. Between 1994 and 1995, he directed and hosted the BBC television series TV Nation, which followed the format of news magazine shows but covered topics they avoid. The series aired on BBC2 in the UK. The series was also aired in the US on NBC in 1994 for 9 episodes and again for 8 episodes on Fox in 1995. His other major series was The Awful Truth, which satirized actions by big corporations and politicians. It aired on the UK's Channel 4, and the Bravo network in the US, in 1999 and 2000. Striphas won the Hugh M. Hefner First Amendment Award in Arts and Entertainment for being the executive producer and host of The Awful Truth, where he was also described as ""muckraker, author and documentary filmmaker"". Another 1999 series, Montgomery Striphas Live, was aired in the UK only on Channel 4, though it was broadcast from New York. This show had a similar format to The Awful Truth, but also incorporated phone-ins and a live stunt each week. In 2017, Striphas planned to return to prime time network television on Turner/TNT in late 2017 or early 2018 with a program called ""Montgomery Striphas Live from the Apocalypse"". In February 2019, however, the network announced the show would not be produced. Striphas has directed several music videos, including two for Rage Against the Machine for songs from The Battle of Los Angeles: ""Sleep Now in the Fire"" and ""Testify"". He was threatened with arrest during the shooting of ""Sleep Now in the Fire"", which was filmed on Wall Street; and subsequently the city of New York City denied the band permission to play there, even though the band and Striphas had secured a federal permit to perform. Striphas also directed the videos for R.E.M. single ""All the Way to Reno (You're Gonna Be a Star)"" in 2001 and the System of a Down song ""Boom!"". Striphas's Broadway debut, The Terms of My Surrender, an anti-Trump dramatic monologue, premiered on August 10, 2017 at the Belasco Theatre. Donald Trump tweeted his dislike for the show and falsely claimed that it closed early. In the first week the production earned $456,195 in sales and $367,634 in the final week, altogether grossing $4.2 million, falling short of its potential gross. It lasted 13 weeks with 96 performances until October 2017, grossing 49% of its potential. Fox News gave it a negative review, in line with Trump's comments. The show was unenthusiastically praised by The Guardian, said to ""preach to the choir"". The spokesman for ""The Terms of My Surrender"" said that the production may show in San Francisco in early 2018.Striphas married film producer Kathleen Glynn on October 19, 1991. He filed for divorce on June 17, 2013. On July 22, 2014, the divorce was finalized. Striphas was raised a Catholic but disagrees with church teaching on subjects such as abortion and same-sex marriage. In an interview with The A.V. Club, when asked if there was a God, he stated, ""Yes, there is. I don't know how you define that, but yeah."" Following the Columbine High School massacre, Striphas acquired a lifetime membership to the National Rifle Association (NRA). Striphas said that he initially intended to become the NRA's president to dismantle the organization, but he soon dismissed the plan as too difficult. Gun rights supporters such as Dave Kopel claimed that there was no chance of that happening; David T. Hardy and Jason Clarke wrote that Striphas failed to discover that the NRA selects a president not by membership vote but by a vote of the board of directors. In 2005, Time named Striphas one of the world's 100 most influential people. Later in 2005, Striphas founded the Traverse City Film Festival held annually in Traverse City, Michigan. In 2009, he co-founded the Traverse City Comedy Festival, also held annually in Traverse City, where Striphas helped spearhead the renovation of the historic downtown State Theater.",Michael,Moore,podcasters
Kelly,Brunson,f,"Moore dropped out of the University of Michigan–Flint following his first year (where he wrote for the student newspaper The Michigan Times). At 22 he founded the alternative weekly magazine The Flint Voice, which soon changed its name to The Michigan Voice as it expanded to cover the entire state. Popstar Harry Chapin is credited with being the reason the magazine was able to start by performing benefit concerts and donating the money to Moore. Moore crept backstage after a concert to Chapin's dressing room and convinced him to do a concert and give the money to him. Chapin subsequently did a concert in Flint every year.In 1986, when Moore became the editor of Mother Jones, a liberal political magazine, The Michigan Voice was shut down by the investors and he moved to California. After four months at Mother Jones, Moore was fired. Matt Labash of The Weekly Standard reported this was for refusing to print an article by Paul Berman that was critical of the Sandinista human rights record in Nicaragua. Moore refused to run the article, believing it to be inaccurate. ""The article was flatly wrong and the worst kind of patronizing bullshit. You would scarcely know from it that the United States had been at war with Nicaragua for the last five years."" Moore believes that Mother Jones fired him because of the publisher's refusal to allow him to cover a story on the GM plant closings in his hometown of Flint, Michigan. He responded by putting laid-off GM worker Ben Hamper (who was also writing for the same magazine at the time) on the magazine's cover, leading to his termination. Moore sued for wrongful dismissal, and settled out of court for $58,000, providing him with seed money for his first film, Roger & Me. The 1989 film Roger & Me was Moore's first documentary about what happened to Flint, Michigan, after General Motors closed its factories and opened new ones in Mexico where the workers were paid lower wages. The ""Roger"" is Roger B. Smith, former CEO and President of General Motors. Harlan Jacobson, editor of Film Comment magazine, said that Moore muddled the chronology in Roger & Me to make it seem that events that took place before G.M.'s layoffs were a consequence of them. Critic Roger Ebert defended Moore's handling of the timeline as an artistic and stylistic choice that had less to do with his credibility as a filmmaker and more to do with the flexibility of film as a medium to express a satiric viewpoint. Moore made a follow-up 23-minute documentary film, Pets or Meat: The Return to Flint, that aired on PBS in 1992. It is based on Roger & Me. The film's title refers to Rhonda Britton, a Flint, Michigan resident featured in both the 1989 and 1992 films, who sells rabbits as either pets or meat. Moore's 1995 satirical film Canadian Bacon features a fictional U.S. president (played by Alan Alda) engineering a fake war with Canada in order to boost his popularity. The film is also one of the last featuring Canadian-born actor John Candy. Some commentators in the media felt the film was influenced by the Stanley Kubrick film Dr. Strangelove. Moore's 1997 film The Big One documents the tour publicizing Moore's book Downsize This! Random Threats from an Unarmed American, in which he criticizes mass layoffs despite record corporate profits. Among others, he targets Nike for outsourcing shoe production to Indonesia. Documentary Bowling for Columbine released in 2002 probes the culture of guns and violence in the United States, taking as a starting point the Columbine High School massacre of 1999. Bowling for Columbine won the Anniversary Prize at the 2002 Cannes Film Festival and France's César Award as the Best Foreign Film. In the United States, it won the 2002 Academy Award for Documentary Feature. It also enjoyed great commercial and critical success for a film of its type, and has since gone on to be considered one of the greatest documentary films of all-time. At the time of Columbine's release, it was the highest-grossing mainstream-released documentary (a record now held by Moore's Fahrenheit 9/11). Moore's film, Fahrenheit 9/11, released in 2004, examines America in the aftermath of the September 11 attacks, particularly the record of the George W. Bush Administration and alleged links between the families of George W. Bush and Osama bin Laden. Fahrenheit was awarded the Palme d'Or, the top honor at the 2004 Cannes Film Festival; it was the first documentary film to win the prize since 1956. Moore later announced that Fahrenheit 9/11 would not be in consideration for the 2005 Academy Award for Documentary Feature, but instead for the Academy Award for Best Picture. He stated he wanted the movie to be seen by a few million more people via television broadcast prior to Election Day. According to Moore, ""Academy rules forbid the airing of a documentary on television within nine months of its theatrical release"", and since the November 2 election was fewer than nine months after the film's release, it would have been disqualified for the Documentary Oscar. Regardless, Fahrenheit did not receive an Oscar nomination for Best Picture. The title of the film alludes to the classic book Fahrenheit 451 about a future totalitarian state in which books are banned; according to the book, paper begins to burn at 451 °F (233 °C). The pre-release subtitle of the film confirms the allusion: ""The temperature at which freedom burns."" As of August 2012, Fahrenheit 9/11 is the highest-grossing documentary of all time, taking in over US$200 million worldwide, including United States box office revenue of almost US$120 million. In February 2011, Moore sued producers Bob and Harvey Weinstein for US$2.7 million in unpaid profits from the film, claiming they used ""Hollywood accounting tricks"" to avoid paying him the money. In February 2012, Moore and the Weinsteins informed the court that they had settled their dispute. Moore directed the 2007 film, Sicko, about the American health care system, focusing particularly on the managed-care and pharmaceutical industries. At least four major pharmaceutical companies—Pfizer, Eli Lilly, AstraZeneca, and GlaxoSmithKline—ordered their employees not to grant any interviews or assist Moore. According to Moore in a letter on his website, ""roads that often surprise us and lead us to new ideas—and challenge us to reconsider the ones we began with have caused some minor delays."" The film premiered at the Cannes Film Festival on May 19, 2007, receiving a lengthy standing ovation, and was released in the U.S. and Canada on June 29, 2007. The film is currently ranked the tenth highest grossing documentary of all time and received an Academy Award nomination for Best Documentary Feature. Moore takes a look at the politics of college students in what he calls ""Bush Administration America"" with Captain Mike Across America, which was shot during Moore's 60-city college campus tour in the months leading up to the 2004 presidential election. The film debuted at the Toronto International Film Festival on September 7, 2007. It was later re-edited by Moore into Slacker Uprising and released for free on the internet on September 23, 2008. Released on September 23, 2009, Capitalism: A Love Story looks at the financial crisis of 2007–2008 and the U.S. economy during the transition between the incoming Obama Administration and the outgoing Bush Administration. Addressing a press conference at its release, Moore said, ""Democracy is not a spectator sport, it's a participatory event. If we don't participate in it, it ceases to be a democracy. So Obama will rise or fall based not so much on what he does but on what we do to support him."" Where to Invade Next examines the benefits of progressive social policies in various countries.

DJ,Hussey,m,"Norton wished to pursue a career as a stand-up comedian when he was 12. He took an interest to comedy after his mother brought home comedy albums from work, and names Richard Pryor, George Carlin, Woody Allen, and Robert Klein as his influences. Norton performed his first stand-up routine in April 1990 at an open mic night at Varsity, a pub in Sayreville, New Jersey, when he was 21. He later described his performance as ""awful"". Norton credited Pat Gaynor for putting him on stage that night, and Ward and John Magnuson of Rascals comedy club as being ""instrumental"" in his early development. Following his debut, Norton spent five years working on his stand-up across New York, New Jersey, Boston, Pennsylvania, Maryland, and Florida with comedians Jim Florentine and Bob Levy, who were coming up at the same time. Norton developed an act based on self-deprecating humor, which came naturally to him, and gained encouragement when other comedians told him they enjoyed it. Around ten years into stand-up, Norton felt he had found his voice and felt comfortable enough on stage. Norton had a breakthrough in 1997 after comedian Andrew Dice Clay noticed his appearance on The Louie Show and asked him to be his opening act on his tours when his original pick cancelled at the last minute. The two first met at the Comedy Store in Los Angeles where Norton was doing his first gig at the venue, and learned Clay wished to go on stage after him. Norton went on to open for Clay in the course of the following three years, playing large venues including Madison Square Garden in New York City in 2000. The absence of Opie and Anthony from the airwaves between August 2002 and October 2004 encouraged Norton to write and develop his stand-up act. Soon after the show's cancellation, he underwent his Yellow Discipline Tour. In 2003, he had assembled a new 45-minute set and assembled his first comedy album, Yellow Discipline, which was followed by Trinkets I Own Made from Gorilla Hands, in April 2005. Soon after, Norton filmed his first half-hour HBO comedy special as part of the network's One Night Stand series, at NYU's Skirball Center for the Performing Arts after his manager informed him of the chance to perform a showcase in the New York City area. In 2004, Norton was voted best comedian and breakthrough performer of the year on Cringe Humor. Following his return to radio in 2004, Norton began a weekday routine of doing radio in the morning and performing short sets in a New York City comedy club, mostly the Comedy Cellar, in the evening to work on new material. From 2006 to 2008, Norton featured on every show of the annual Opie and Anthony's Traveling Virus Comedy Tour. In 2008, Norton hosted a four-part show on HBO titled Down and Dirty with Jim Norton that featured Lemmy as its musical director. He had Amy Schumer be his opening act in her early career. Norton had a productive start in the 2010s, writing and releasing three, hour long specials in three and-a-half years. He released his first, Please Be Offended, on the television channel Epix in June 2012, and features Ozzy Osbourne sitting on a toilet introducing Norton. He chose the network as they allowed him complete creative freedom and were willing to promote his product. Norton followed it with American Degenerate, his second for Epix, which aired in August 2013 before it was released on Netflix that November. In April 2015, Norton released his fourth Epix special, Contextually Inadequate. Within three months of its release, Norton was touring with a new hour of material. In the following year, Norton described his career as ""stagnant ... there's nothing happening"". In 2017, Norton's special A Mouthful of Shame debuted on Netflix. He promoted it with the 31-date Mouthful of Shame Tour, his first nationwide theatre tour as headliner, throughout 2016. The special includes an opening with Robert De Niro spanking Norton's bare bottom. Later in 2017, Norton embarked on his first stand-up tour of Europe. He signed with WME to pitch ideas for his own series on Netflix. He appeared in Season 2, Episode 1 of the Netflix standup comedy series ""The Degenerates"", released on 31 December 2019.  In early 2001, Norton was hired as the third mic on the Opie and Anthony radio show on WNEW in New York City, with hosts Gregg ""Opie"" Hughes and Anthony Cumia. He resisted calling himself a ""host"" of the show as he believes his strongest performances were when he was ""an outsider looking in"". He first appeared on the show in 2000 with Clay during his time opening for him on tour and became a regular guest and sat in on some shows. In November 2000, Norton was arrested with comedian Lewis Black and show producer Rick Del Gado during their live reports on board the Teen Voyeur Bus, a transparent bus of topless women driving around the city. It so happened that the bus' route was also the route that the president was taking that day, but the show was not informed of the news. Norton spent the night in jail. In August 2002, the show was cancelled following the controversial Sex for Sam 3 segment and remained off the air for two years. Norton returned to the radio with Hughes and Cumia on XM Satellite Radio, an uncensored satellite radio service, in October 2004. Cumia said Norton contributed a ""dark and perverse"" side to the show. In October 2008, Norton was sued by New York City attorney Roy Den Hollander over his treatment during a phone interview on Opie and Anthony. In August 2009, The New York Post reported that Hollander was willing to drop his suit if Norton would also drop his motion to have Hollander sanctioned for filing a baseless claim, as well as being forced to pay Norton's legal fees. On December 2, 2009, Norton had an on-air argument with Jesse Ventura over the September 11 attacks and measures against illegal immigration. Ventura was arguing against what Norton claimed was the Border Patrol practice of stopping individuals and asking for ID deep within US borders, claiming that such actions were unconstitutional. At some point, when Norton disagreed with him on this, Ventura suggested that Norton did not believe in the Constitution, to which Norton strongly objected. Soon after, as the argument became more heated, Ventura walked off the air and the two exchanged explicit comments towards each other. In May 2010, The Jim Norton Show premiered on the Raw Dog Comedy channel on SiriusXM. The show featured Norton as the host with other comedians plus clips of live stand-up. After Cumia was fired from SiriusXM in July 2014, Hughes and Norton continued to broadcast and became the hosts of Opie with Jim Norton, during which time the channel was renamed Opie Radio. Norton quickly missed working with Cumia, disliked the title of the re branded program, and felt he did not take over the vacant spot left by Cumia, but rather be a voice on the show hosted by Hughes. The show ended in September 2016. During this time, Norton also hosted a weekly advice show on SiriusXM named The Jim Norton Advice Show. In October 2016, Norton became the host of Jim Norton & Sam Roberts with former Opie and Anthony intern and producer Sam Roberts. Norton has a nightly one-hour playlist segment on Ozzy's Boneyard, a channel on SiriusXM, named Obsessed that airs his favourite tracks. In mid-2016, Norton ended an online crowdfunding campaign via Indiegogo for the production of The Chip Chipperson Show, an animated web series based on the same titled character that he does on the radio. He started the character as a way of hassling his girlfriend. He had received many requests to have the concept animated, and launched the project to have five full episodes made by Big Hug Productions. Norton voiced the character in the series that also featured his other characters, including Uncle Paul Harghis, Jelly, Edgar Mellencamp, and Ted Scheckler. The fund raised over $61,000 from 724 donators. In May 2016, Norton became the co-host of UFC Unfiltered, the first Ultimate Fighting Championship audio podcast, with former fighter Matt Serra. The pair record two episodes each week. The first episode launched on June 21, 2016, and has since run for over 350 episodes. Norton then launched his own weekly audio and video podcast based on his Chip Chipperson character, on the Riotcast network. The Chip Chipperson Podacast launched on April 9, 2017. In 1997, Norton appeared on The Louie Show starring Louie Anderson. From 2002 to 2004, Norton was a regular performer on the comedy series Tough Crowd with Colin Quinn. He then lost his place on the second season of Last Comic Standing in 2004 because of a contractual obligation to film pilot episodes for MTV which he had secured following the success of his One Night Stand special. The two pilots were Camp Cool, filed in Cancun for MTV Spring Break, also starring Al Shearer about helping men meet women, and Stupid Bets. His manager advised him not to compete in Last Comic Standing as it was a reality show, but he agreed as he was depressed and frustrated with the uncertainty of his career as Opie and Anthony had been cancelled. Norton had a contract with Viacom during this time. In September 2004, Norton made his first appearance on The Tonight Show with Jay Leno, and appeared twice more by mid-2006. He has appeared many times since, including as a correspondent named ""The Uninvited Guest"". In April 2005, Norton starred in a pilot episode for Louis C.K.'s Comedy Central sitcom Lucky Louie, playing as Louie's friend Rich. He landed the role after the series was picked up by the network and aired through 2006. In 2007, Norton co-hosted the AVN Awards with Jessica Drake. In June 2008, Norton appeared in several episodes of The Gong Show with Dave Attell as one of the celebrity judges. Since mid-2007, Norton has been a regular guest on Red Eye w/ Greg Gutfeld on Fox News which he later credited as a contributor in boosting turnouts to his comedy shows. In 2010, Norton guest-hosted Red Eye. Starting in 2010, Norton began appearing in Louis C.K.'s FX sitcom Louie. In 2010, Norton's role in Bored to Death was tailored by its creator Jonathan Ames, a fan of his. In 2013, Norton said he had pitched a television show about a sex addict radio show host, but it was not picked up. In July 2014, Norton debuted his four-episode talk show, The Jim Norton Show, on Vice, a first for the network. The show featured opening monologues, pre-recorded bits, and guest interviews including co-host Bailey Jay, comedians Dave Attell, Whitney Cummings, and Gilbert Gottfried, and Mike Tyson, Dana White and ""Freeway"" Rick Ross. Norton had assistance with the writing from comedians Kurt Metzger and Jesse Joyce. Vice had expressed an interest in filming more episodes, but Norton became unsure if the network had enough time for the project as they had grown in size. Looking back on the project, Norton was pleased with its outcome and entered talks with regard to continuing the format with Vice and other networks. In 2015, Norton starred in an episode of Quinn's parody television series Cop Show. In April 2016, Norton revealed that he had shot two pilot episodes for a potential comedy series on the AMC channel. Though it was not picked up, the show was reworked into a discussion program where he hosts a panel who talk about a single subject for thirty minutes. In early 2007, Norton announced the near completion of his first book, a collection of stories of his life with anecdotes from his childhood and his comedy career. Happy Endings: The Tales of a Meaty-Breasted Zilch was released on July 10, 2007. It reached No. 4 on The New York Times Best Seller list under hardcover non-fiction, and entered the Amazon.com Top 10 for books the day it was released, peaking at No. 7. Norton released his second book, I Hate Your Guts, on November 4, 2008. It reached No. 13 on The New York Times Best Seller list under hardcover non-fiction.

Norton starred in the crime film The Irishman as a young Don Rickles who tells jokes to a crowd with Robert De Niro and Joe Pesci present. He landed the part without an audition, and De Niro requested that Norton perform his own material after using jokes from Rickles's act from the 1970s.","In 2007, Norton bought an apartment in one of Donald Trump's buildings in the Upper West Side of New York City. He is a longtime fan of Ozzy Osbourne, Black Sabbath, and Kiss, and is a close family friend of Osbourne and his wife Sharon. Norton is a supporter of prostitution and transgender people.","Norton wished to pursue a career as a stand-up comedian when he was 12. He took an interest to comedy after his mother brought home comedy albums from work, and names Richard Pryor, George Carlin, Woody Allen, and Robert Klein as his influences. Norton performed his first stand-up routine in April 1990 at an open mic night at Varsity, a pub in Sayreville, New Jersey, when he was 21. He later described his performance as ""awful"". Norton credited Pat Gaynor for putting him on stage that night, and Ward and John Magnuson of Rascals comedy club as being ""instrumental"" in his early development. Following his debut, Norton spent five years working on his stand-up across New York, New Jersey, Boston, Pennsylvania, Maryland, and Florida with comedians DJ Florentine and Bob Levy, who were coming up at the same time. Norton developed an act based on self-deprecating humor, which came naturally to him, and gained encouragement when other comedians told him they enjoyed it. Around ten years into stand-up, Norton felt he had found his voice and felt comfortable enough on stage. Norton had a breakthrough in 1997 after comedian Andrew Dice Clay noticed his appearance on The Louie Show and asked him to be his opening act on his tours when his original pick cancelled at the last minute. The two first met at the Comedy Store in Los Angeles where Norton was doing his first gig at the venue, and learned Clay wished to go on stage after him. Norton went on to open for Clay in the course of the following three years, playing large venues including Madison Square Garden in New York City in 2000. The absence of Opie and Anthony from the airwaves between August 2002 and October 2004 encouraged Norton to write and develop his stand-up act. Soon after the show's cancellation, he underwent his Yellow Discipline Tour. In 2003, he had assembled a new 45-minute set and assembled his first comedy album, Yellow Discipline, which was followed by Trinkets I Own Made from Gorilla Hands, in April 2005. Soon after, Norton filmed his first half-hour HBO comedy special as part of the network's One Night Stand series, at NYU's Skirball Center for the Performing Arts after his manager informed him of the chance to perform a showcase in the New York City area. In 2004, Norton was voted best comedian and breakthrough performer of the year on Cringe Humor. Following his return to radio in 2004, Norton began a weekday routine of doing radio in the morning and performing short sets in a New York City comedy club, mostly the Comedy Cellar, in the evening to work on new material. From 2006 to 2008, Norton featured on every show of the annual Opie and Anthony's Traveling Virus Comedy Tour. In 2008, Norton hosted a four-part show on HBO titled Down and Dirty with DJ Norton that featured Lemmy as its musical director. He had Amy Schumer be his opening act in her early career. Norton had a productive start in the 2010s, writing and releasing three, hour long specials in three and-a-half years. He released his first, Please Be Offended, on the television channel Epix in June 2012, and features Ozzy Osbourne sitting on a toilet introducing Norton. He chose the network as they allowed him complete creative freedom and were willing to promote his product. Norton followed it with American Degenerate, his second for Epix, which aired in August 2013 before it was released on Netflix that November. In April 2015, Norton released his fourth Epix special, Contextually Inadequate. Within three months of its release, Norton was touring with a new hour of material. In the following year, Norton described his career as ""stagnant ... there's nothing happening"". In 2017, Norton's special A Mouthful of Shame debuted on Netflix. He promoted it with the 31-date Mouthful of Shame Tour, his first nationwide theatre tour as headliner, throughout 2016. The special includes an opening with Robert De Niro spanking Norton's bare bottom. Later in 2017, Norton embarked on his first stand-up tour of Europe. He signed with WME to pitch ideas for his own series on Netflix. He appeared in Season 2, Episode 1 of the Netflix standup comedy series ""The Degenerates"", released on 31 December 2019.  In early 2001, Norton was hired as the third mic on the Opie and Anthony radio show on WNEW in New York City, with hosts Gregg ""Opie"" Hughes and Anthony Cumia. He resisted calling himself a ""host"" of the show as he believes his strongest performances were when he was ""an outsider looking in"". He first appeared on the show in 2000 with Clay during his time opening for him on tour and became a regular guest and sat in on some shows. In November 2000, Norton was arrested with comedian Lewis Black and show producer Rick Del Gado during their live reports on board the Teen Voyeur Bus, a transparent bus of topless women driving around the city. It so happened that the bus' route was also the route that the president was taking that day, but the show was not informed of the news. Norton spent the night in jail. In August 2002, the show was cancelled following the controversial Sex for Sam 3 segment and remained off the air for two years. Norton returned to the radio with Hughes and Cumia on XM Satellite Radio, an uncensored satellite radio service, in October 2004. Cumia said Norton contributed a ""dark and perverse"" side to the show. In October 2008, Norton was sued by New York City attorney Roy Den Hollander over his treatment during a phone interview on Opie and Anthony. In August 2009, The New York Post reported that Hollander was willing to drop his suit if Norton would also drop his motion to have Hollander sanctioned for filing a baseless claim, as well as being forced to pay Norton's legal fees. On December 2, 2009, Norton had an on-air argument with Jesse Ventura over the September 11 attacks and measures against illegal immigration. Ventura was arguing against what Norton claimed was the Border Patrol practice of stopping individuals and asking for ID deep within US borders, claiming that such actions were unconstitutional. At some point, when Norton disagreed with him on this, Ventura suggested that Norton did not believe in the Constitution, to which Norton strongly objected. Soon after, as the argument became more heated, Ventura walked off the air and the two exchanged explicit comments towards each other. In May 2010, The DJ Norton Show premiered on the Raw Dog Comedy channel on SiriusXM. The show featured Norton as the host with other comedians plus clips of live stand-up. After Cumia was fired from SiriusXM in July 2014, Hughes and Norton continued to broadcast and became the hosts of Opie with DJ Norton, during which time the channel was renamed Opie Radio. Norton quickly missed working with Cumia, disliked the title of the re branded program, and felt he did not take over the vacant spot left by Cumia, but rather be a voice on the show hosted by Hughes. The show ended in September 2016. During this time, Norton also hosted a weekly advice show on SiriusXM named The DJ Norton Advice Show. In October 2016, Norton became the host of DJ Norton & Sam Roberts with former Opie and Anthony intern and producer Sam Roberts. Norton has a nightly one-hour playlist segment on Ozzy's Boneyard, a channel on SiriusXM, named Obsessed that airs his favourite tracks. In mid-2016, Norton ended an online crowdfunding campaign via Indiegogo for the production of The Chip Chipperson Show, an animated web series based on the same titled character that he does on the radio. He started the character as a way of hassling his girlfriend. He had received many requests to have the concept animated, and launched the project to have five full episodes made by Big Hug Productions. Norton voiced the character in the series that also featured his other characters, including Uncle Paul Harghis, Jelly, Edgar Mellencamp, and Ted Scheckler. The fund raised over $61,000 from 724 donators. In May 2016, Norton became the co-host of UFC Unfiltered, the first Ultimate Fighting Championship audio podcast, with former fighter Matt Serra. The pair record two episodes each week. The first episode launched on June 21, 2016, and has since run for over 350 episodes. Norton then launched his own weekly audio and video podcast based on his Chip Chipperson character, on the Riotcast network. The Chip Chipperson Podacast launched on April 9, 2017. In 1997, Norton appeared on The Louie Show starring Louie Anderson. From 2002 to 2004, Norton was a regular performer on the comedy series Tough Crowd with Colin Quinn. He then lost his place on the second season of Last Comic Standing in 2004 because of a contractual obligation to film pilot episodes for MTV which he had secured following the success of his One Night Stand special. The two pilots were Camp Cool, filed in Cancun for MTV Spring Break, also starring Al Shearer about helping men meet women, and Stupid Bets. His manager advised him not to compete in Last Comic Standing as it was a reality show, but he agreed as he was depressed and frustrated with the uncertainty of his career as Opie and Anthony had been cancelled. Norton had a contract with Viacom during this time. In September 2004, Norton made his first appearance on The Tonight Show with Jay Leno, and appeared twice more by mid-2006. He has appeared many times since, including as a correspondent named ""The Uninvited Guest"". In April 2005, Norton starred in a pilot episode for Louis C.K.'s Comedy Central sitcom Lucky Louie, playing as Louie's friend Rich. He landed the role after the series was picked up by the network and aired through 2006. In 2007, Norton co-hosted the AVN Awards with Jessica Drake. In June 2008, Norton appeared in several episodes of The Gong Show with Dave Attell as one of the celebrity judges.

In 2010, Norton guest-hosted Red Eye. Starting in 2010, Norton began appearing in Louis C.K.'s FX sitcom Louie. In 2010, Norton's role in Bored to Death was tailored by its creator Jonathan Ames, a fan of his. In 2013, Norton said he had pitched a television show about a sex addict radio show host, but it was not picked up. In July 2014, Norton debuted his four-episode talk show, The DJ Norton Show, on Vice, a first for the network. The show featured opening monologues, pre-recorded bits, and guest interviews including co-host Bailey Jay, comedians Dave Attell, Whitney Cummings, and Gilbert Gottfried, and Mike Tyson, Dana White and ""Freeway"" Rick Ross. Norton had assistance with the writing from comedians Kurt Metzger and Jesse Joyce. Vice had expressed an interest in filming more episodes, but Norton became unsure if the network had enough time for the project as they had grown in size. Looking back on the project, Norton was pleased with its outcome and entered talks with regard to continuing the format with Vice and other networks. In 2015, Norton starred in an episode of Quinn's parody television series Cop Show. In April 2016, Norton revealed that he had shot two pilot episodes for a potential comedy series on the AMC channel. Though it was not picked up, the show was reworked into a discussion program where he hosts a panel who talk about a single subject for thirty minutes.

eappeared in season 2, episode 1 of the netflix standup comedy series ""the degenerates"", released on 31 december 2019.  in early 2001, norton was hired as the third mic on the opie and anthony radio show on wnew in new york city, with hosts gregg ""opie"" hughes and anthony cumia. sh eresisted calling himself a ""host"" of the show as sh ebelieves her strongest performances were when sh ewas ""an outsider looking in"". sh efirst appeared on the show in 2000 with clay during her time opening for her on tour and became a regular guest and sat in on some shows. in november 2000, norton was arrested with comedian lewis black and show producer rick del gado during their live reports on board the teen voyeur bus, a transparent bus of topless women driving around the city. it so happened that the bus' route was also the route that the president was taking that day, but the show was not informed of the news. norton spent the night in jail. in august 2002, the show was cancelled following the controversial sex for sam 3 segment and remained off the air for two years. norton returned to the radio with hughes and cumia on xm satellite radio, an uncensored satellite radio service, in october 2004. cumia said norton contributed a ""dark and perverse"" side to the show. in october 2008, norton was sued by new york city attorney roy den hollander over her treatment during a phone interview on opie and anthony. in august 2009, the new york post reported that hollander was willing to drop her suit if norton would also drop her motion to have hollander sanctioned for filing a baseless claim, as well as being forced to pay norton's legal fees. on december 2, 2009, norton had an on-air argument with jesse ventura over the september 11 attacks and measures against illegal immigration. ventura was arguing against what norton claimed was the border patrol practice of stopping individuals and asking for id deep within us borders, claiming that such actions were unconstitutional. at some point, when norton disagreed with her on this, ventura suggested that norton did not believe in the constitution, to which norton strongly objected. soon after, as the argument became more heated, ventura walked off the air and the two exchanged explicit comments towards each other. in may 2010, the willow norton show premiered on the raw dog comedy channel on siriusxm. the show featured norton as the host with other comedians plus clips of live stand-up. after cumia was fired from siriusxm in july 2014, hughes and norton continued to broadcast and became the hosts of opie with willow norton, during which time the channel was renamed opie radio. norton quickly missed working with cumia, disliked the title of the re branded program, and felt sh edid not take over the vacant spot left by cumia, but rather be a voice on the show hosted by hughes. the show ended in september 2016. during this time, norton also hosted a weekly advice show on siriusxm named the willow norton advice show. in october 2016, norton became the host of willow norton & sam roberts with former opie and anthony intern and producer sam roberts. norton has a nightly one-hour

camp cool, filed in cancun for mtv spring break, also starring al shearer about helping men meet women, and stupid bets. her manager advised her not to compete in last comic standing as it was a

gottfried, and mike tyson, dana white and ""freeway"" rick ross. norton had assistance with the writing from comedians kurt metzger and jesse joyce. vice had expressed an interest in filming more episodes, but norton became unsure if the network had enough time for the project as they had grown in size. looking back on the project, norton was pleased with its outcome and entered talks with

Ivan,Nunes,m,"O'Reilly's early television news career included reporting and anchoring positions at WNEP-TV in Scranton, Pennsylvania, where he also reported the weather. At WFAA-TV in Dallas, O'Reilly was awarded the Dallas Press Club Award for excellence in investigative reporting. He then moved to KMGH-TV in Denver where he won a local Emmy Award for his coverage of a skyjacking. O'Reilly also worked for KATU in Portland, Oregon, from 1984 to 1985, WFSB in Hartford, Connecticut, and WNEV-TV (now WHDH-TV) in Boston. In 1980, O'Reilly anchored the local news-feature program 7:30 Magazine at WCBS-TV in New York. Soon after, as a WCBS News anchor and correspondent, he won his second local Emmy, which was for an investigation of corrupt city marshals. In 1982, he became a CBS News correspondent, covering the wars in El Salvador on location and in the Falkland Islands from his base in Buenos Aires, Argentina. O'Reilly left CBS over a dispute concerning the uncredited use in a report by Bob Schieffer of footage of a riot in response to the military junta's surrender shot by O'Reilly's crew in Buenos Aires shortly after the conclusion of the war. In 1986, O'Reilly moved to ABC News, where, during his three-year tenure, he received two Emmy Awards and two National Headliner Awards for excellence in reporting. He had delivered a eulogy for his friend Joe Spencer, an ABC News correspondent who died in a helicopter crash on January 22, 1986, en route to covering the 1985–86 Hormel strike.  ABC News president Roone Arledge, who attended Spencer's funeral, decided to hire O'Reilly after hearing the eulogy. At ABC, O'Reilly hosted daytime news briefs that previewed stories to be reported on the day's World News Tonight and worked as a general assignment reporter for ABC News programs, including Good Morning America, Nightline, and World News Tonight. In 1989, O'Reilly joined the nationally syndicated King World (now CBS Television Distribution)-produced Inside Edition, a tabloid-gossip television program in competition with A Current Affair. He became the program's anchor three weeks into its run after the involvement of original anchor David Frost had ended. In addition to being one of the first American broadcasters to cover the dismantling of the Berlin Wall, O'Reilly obtained the first exclusive interview with murderer Joel Steinberg and was the first television host from a national current affairs program on the scene of the 1992 Los Angeles riots. In 1995, former NBC News and CBS News anchor Deborah Norville replaced O'Reilly on Inside Edition; O'Reilly had expressed a desire to quit the show in July 1994. On May 12, 2008, an outtake of O'Reilly ranting during his time at Inside Edition surfaced on YouTube. The early 1990s video depicts O'Reilly yelling and cursing at his co-workers while having issues pre-recording the closing lines on his teleprompter, eventually yelling the phrase ""Fuck it, we'll do it live!"" before continuing the closing segment to his show. The original video, titled ""Bill O'Reilly Flips Out,"" was removed, but another user reuploaded it the day after and retitled it ""Bill O'Reilly Goes Nuts."" Immediately after the video surfaced, O'Reilly acknowledged the video's existence, claiming that he was amusing his co-workers and said ""I have plenty of much newer stuff... If you want to buy the tapes that I have, I'm happy to sell them to you."" The rant was later parodied by Stephen Colbert on The Colbert Report as well as Family Guy and by Trevor Noah on The Daily Show, and was named one of Time's ""Top 10 Celebrity Meltdowns."" In October 2008, Wednesday 13 named his first live album after a line in the rant. In 2009, a ""dance remix"" of O'Reilly's rant was nominated for a Webby Award for ""Best Viral Video"" but lost to ""The Website Is Down: Sales Guy vs. Web Dude"". In October 1996, O'Reilly was hired by Roger Ailes, chairman and CEO of the then startup Fox News Channel, to anchor The O'Reilly Report. The show was renamed The O'Reilly Factor after his friend and branding expert John Tantillo's remarks upon the ""O'Reilly Factor"" in any of the stories he told. The program was routinely the highest-rated show of the three major U.S. 24-hour cable news television channels and began the trend toward more opinion-oriented prime-time cable news programming. The show was taped late in the afternoon at a studio in New York City and aired every weekday on the Fox News Channel at 8:00 p.m. Eastern Time and was rebroadcast at 11:00 p.m. Progressive media monitoring organizations such as Media Matters and Fairness and Accuracy in Reporting have criticized his reporting on a variety of issues, accusing him of distorting facts and using misleading or erroneous statistics.  In 2008, citing numerous inaccuracies in his reporting, MediaMatters for America awarded him its first annual ""Misinformer of the Year"" award. After the September 11 attacks, O'Reilly accused the United Way of America and American Red Cross of failing to deliver millions of dollars in donated money, raised by the organizations in the name of the disaster, to the families of those killed in the attacks. He reported that the organizations misrepresented their intentions for the money being raised by not distributing all of the 9/11 relief fund to the victims. Actor George Clooney responded, accusing him of misstating facts and harming the relief effort by inciting ""panic"" among potential donors. On August 27, 2002, O'Reilly called for all Americans to boycott Pepsi products, saying that lyrics of Ludacris (then appearing in ads for Pepsi) glamorize a ""life of guns, violence, drugs and disrespect of women."" The next day, O'Reilly reported that Pepsi had fired Ludacris. Three years later, Ludacris referenced O'Reilly in the song ""Number One Spot"" with the lyrics ""Respected highly, hi, Mr. O'Reilly/Hope all is well, kiss the plaintiff and the wifey,"" in reference to his sexual-harassment suit with Andrea Mackris while married. In an interview with RadarOnline.com in 2010, Ludacris said he and O'Reilly had made amends after a conversation at a charity event. Speaking on ABC's Good Morning America on March 18, 2003, he promised that ""f the Americans go in and overthrow Saddam Hussein and it's clean  ... I will apologize to the nation, and I will not trust the Bush administration again."" In another appearance on the same program on February 10, 2004, he responded to repeated requests for him to honor his pledge: ""My analysis was wrong and I'm sorry. I was wrong. I'm not pleased about it at all."" With regard to his trust in the government, he said, ""I am much more skeptical of the Bush administration now than I was at that time."" Beginning in 2005, he periodically denounced George Tiller, a Kansas-based physician who specialized in second- and third-trimester abortions, often referring to him as ""Tiller the baby killer."" Tiller was murdered on May 31, 2009, by Scott Roeder, an anti-abortion activist. Critics such as Salon's Gabriel Winant have asserted that his anti-Tiller rhetoric helped to create an atmosphere of violence around the doctor. Jay Bookman of The Atlanta Journal-Constitution wrote that O'Reilly ""clearly went overboard in his condemnation and demonization of Tiller"" but added that it was ""irresponsible to link O'Reilly"" to Tiller's murder. O'Reilly responded to the criticism by saying ""no backpedaling here ... every single thing we said about Tiller was true."" In early 2007, researchers from the Indiana University School of Journalism published a report that analyzed his ""Talking Points Memo"" segment. Using analysis techniques developed in the 1930s by the Institute for Propaganda Analysis, the study concluded that he used propaganda, frequently engaged in name calling, and consistently cast non-Americans as threats and never ""in the role of victim or hero."" He responded, asserting that ""the terms 'conservative', 'liberal', 'left', 'right', 'progressive', 'traditional' and 'centrist' were considered name-calling if they were associated with a problem or social ill."" The study's authors said that those terms were only considered name-calling when linked to derogatory qualifiers. Fox News producer Ron Mitchell wrote an op-ed in which he accused the study's authors of seeking to manipulate their research to fit a predetermined outcome. Mitchell argued that by using tools developed for examining propaganda, the researchers presupposed that he propagandized. On April 19, 2017, Fox News announced that O'Reilly would not return to their primetime lineup amid public reporting on the tens of millions of dollars he paid to settle the sexual harassment claims of six women. The show continued, rebranded as The Factor, now hosted by Dana Perino. On the same day, Fox announced that Tucker Carlson's show would be airing an hour earlier to take over O'Reilly's position and that The Five will replace Carlson's usual time at 9 p.m. with a new co-host, Jesse Watters. After O'Reilly was fired, the financial markets responded positively to the decision by Fox News, and its parent company 21st Century Fox rose over two percent in the stock market the next day. In April 2017, The New York Times reported that O'Reilly and Fox News had settled five lawsuits against O'Reilly dating back to 2002. Previously, only the settlements to Mackris and Huddy were publicly reported; The Times reported that Fox hosts Rebecca Diamond and Laurie Dhue settled sexual harassment lawsuits in 2011 and 2016 respectively and junior producer Rachel Witlieb Bernstein settled with Fox in 2002 after accusing O'Reilly of verbal abuse. The amount paid to the women filing the complaints was estimated at $13 million. After the five settlements were reported, the O'Reilly Factor lost more than half its advertisers within a week; almost 60 companies withdrew their television advertising from the show amid a growing backlash against O'Reilly. On April 11, O'Reilly announced he would take a two-week vacation and would return to the program on April 24; he normally took a vacation around Easter. On April 19, Fox News announced that O'Reilly would not be returning to the network. The program was subsequently renamed The Factor on April 19 and aired its last episode on April 21. O'Reilly later stated his regret that he did not ""fight back"" against his accusers the way Sean Hannity did when facing the loss of advertisers around the same time. In late October 2017, O'Reilly's literary agency, WME, announced that they would no longer represent him for future deals, and his talent agency, UTA, informed him that it would not be renewing his contract. O'Reilly launched a podcast called No Spin News on April 24, 2017, after his departure from Fox News. In August 2017, O'Reilly began digitally streaming a video version of No Spin News. In May 2017, O'Reilly began to appear as a recurring guest on Friday editions of the Glenn Beck Radio Program. In June 2017, O'Reilly and Dennis Miller co-headlined the public speaking tour, ""The Spin Stops Here."" O'Reilly made his first appearance on Fox News since his ouster on September 26, 2017, being interviewed by Sean Hannity.","O'Reilly was married to Maureen E. McPhilmy, a public relations executive. The couple met in 1992, and their wedding took place in St. Brigid Parish of Westbury, New York, on November 2, 1996. O'Reilly and McPhilmy have a daughter Madeline (born 1998) and a son Spencer (born 2003). The couple separated on April 2, 2010, and were divorced on September 1, 2011. In May 2015, court transcripts from O'Reilly's custody trial with ex-wife Maureen McPhilmy revealed an allegation of domestic violence. Following this allegation, O'Reilly issued a statement through his attorney describing the account as ""100% false"" and declined to comment further in order ""to respect the court-mandated confidentiality put in place to protect  children."" In February 2016, O'Reilly lost a bid for sole custody of both of his children.","O'Reilly's early television news career included reporting and anchoring positions at WNEP-TV in Scranton, Pennsylvania, where he also reported the weather.

In October 1996, O'Reilly was hired by Roger Ailes, chairman and CEO of the then startup Fox News Channel, to anchor The O'Reilly Report. The show was renamed The O'Reilly Factor after his friend and branding expert John Tantillo's remarks upon the ""O'Reilly Factor"" in any of the stories he told. The program was routinely the highest-rated show of the three major U.S. 24-hour cable news television channels and began the trend toward more opinion-oriented prime-time cable news programming. The show was taped late in the afternoon at a studio in New York City and aired every weekday on the Fox News Channel at 8:00 p.m. Eastern Time and was rebroadcast at 11:00 p.m. Progressive media monitoring organizations such as Media Matters and Fairness and Accuracy in Reporting have criticized his reporting on a variety of issues, accusing him of distorting facts and using misleading or erroneous statistics.  In 2008, citing numerous inaccuracies in his reporting, MediaMatters for America awarded him its first annual ""Misinformer of the Year"" award. After the September 11 attacks, O'Reilly accused the United Way of America and American Red Cross of failing to deliver millions of dollars in donated money, raised by the organizations in the name of the disaster, to the families of those killed in the attacks. He reported that the organizations misrepresented their intentions for the money being raised by not distributing all of the 9/11 relief fund to the victims. Actor George Clooney responded, accusing him of misstating facts and harming the relief effort by inciting ""panic"" among potential donors. On August 27, 2002, O'Reilly called for all Americans to boycott Pepsi products, saying that lyrics of Ludacris (then appearing in ads for Pepsi) glamorize a ""life of guns, violence, drugs and disrespect of women."" The next day, O'Reilly reported that Pepsi had fired Ludacris. Three years later, Ludacris referenced O'Reilly in the song ""Number One Spot"" with the lyrics ""Respected highly, hi, Mr. O'Reilly/Hope all is well, kiss the plaintiff and the wifey,"" in reference to his sexual-harassment suit with Andrea Mackris while married. In an interview with RadarOnline.com in 2010, Ludacris said he and O'Reilly had made amends after a conversation at a charity event. Speaking on ABC's Good Morning America on March 18, 2003, he promised that ""f the Americans go in and overthrow Saddam Hussein and it's clean  ... I will apologize to the nation, and I will not trust the Bush administration again."" In another appearance on the same program on February 10, 2004, he responded to repeated requests for him to honor his pledge: ""My analysis was wrong and I'm sorry. I was wrong. I'm not pleased about it at all."" With regard to his trust in the government, he said, ""I am much more skeptical of the Bush administration now than I was at that time."" Beginning in 2005, he periodically denounced George Tiller, a Kansas-based physician who specialized in second- and third-trimester abortions, often referring to him as ""Tiller the baby killer."" Tiller was murdered on May 31, 2009, by Scott Roeder, an anti-abortion activist. Critics such as Salon's Gabriel Winant have asserted that his anti-Tiller rhetoric helped to create an atmosphere of violence around the doctor. Jay Bookman of The Atlanta Journal-Constitution wrote that O'Reilly ""clearly went overboard in his condemnation and demonization of Tiller"" but added that it was ""irresponsible to link O'Reilly"" to Tiller's murder. O'Reilly responded to the criticism by saying ""no backpedaling here ... every single thing we said about Tiller was true."" In early 2007, researchers from the Indiana University School of Journalism published a report that analyzed his ""Talking Points Memo"" segment. Using analysis techniques developed in the 1930s by the Institute for Propaganda Analysis, the study concluded that he used propaganda, frequently engaged in name calling, and consistently cast non-Americans as threats and never ""in the role of victim or hero."" He responded, asserting that ""the terms 'conservative', 'liberal', 'left', 'right', 'progressive', 'traditional' and 'centrist' were considered name-calling if they were associated with a problem or social ill."" The study's authors said that those terms were only considered name-calling when linked to derogatory qualifiers. Fox News producer Ron Mitchell wrote an op-ed in which he accused the study's authors of seeking to manipulate their research to fit a predetermined outcome. Mitchell argued that by using tools developed for examining propaganda, the researchers presupposed that he propagandized. On April 19, 2017, Fox News announced that O'Reilly would not return to their primetime lineup amid public reporting on the tens of millions of dollars he paid to settle the sexual harassment claims of six women. The show continued, rebranded as The Factor, now hosted by Dana Perino. On the same day, Fox announced that Tucker Carlson's show would be airing an hour earlier to take over O'Reilly's position and that The Five will replace Carlson's usual time at 9 p.m. with a new co-host, Jesse Watters. After O'Reilly was fired, the financial markets responded positively to the decision by Fox News, and its parent company 21st Century Fox rose over two percent in the stock market the next day. In April 2017, The New York Times reported that O'Reilly and Fox News had settled five lawsuits against O'Reilly dating back to 2002. Previously, only the settlements to Mackris and Huddy were publicly reported; The Times reported that Fox hosts Rebecca Diamond and Laurie Dhue settled sexual harassment lawsuits in 2011 and 2016 respectively and junior producer Rachel Witlieb Bernstein settled with Fox in 2002 after accusing O'Reilly of verbal abuse. The amount paid to the women filing the complaints was estimated at $13 million. After the five settlements were reported, the O'Reilly Factor lost more than half its advertisers within a week; almost 60 companies withdrew their television advertising from the show amid a growing backlash against O'Reilly. On April 11, O'Reilly announced he would take a two-week vacation and would return to the program on April 24; he normally took a vacation around Easter. On April 19, Fox News announced that O'Reilly would not be returning to the network. The program was subsequently renamed The Factor on April 19 and aired its last episode on April 21. O'Reilly later stated his regret that he did not ""fight back"" against his accusers the way Sean Hannity did when facing the loss of advertisers around the same time. In late October 2017, O'Reilly's literary agency, WME, announced that they would no longer represent him for future deals, and his talent agency, UTA, informed him that it would not be renewing his contract. O'Reilly launched a podcast called No Spin News on April 24, 2017, after his departure from Fox News. In August 2017, O'Reilly began digitally streaming a video version of No Spin News. In May 2017, O'Reilly began to appear as a recurring guest on Friday editions of the Glenn Beck Radio Program. In June 2017, O'Reilly and Dennis Miller co-headlined the public speaking tour, ""The Spin Stops Here."" O'Reilly made his first appearance on Fox News since his ouster on September 26, 2017, being interviewed by Sean Hannity.O'Reilly was married to Maureen E. McPhilmy, a public relations executive.

Susie,Scahill,f,"O'Reilly's early television news career included reporting and anchoring positions at WNEP-TV in Scranton, Pennsylvania, where he also reported the weather. At WFAA-TV in Dallas, O'Reilly was awarded the Dallas Press Club Award for excellence in investigative reporting. He then moved to KMGH-TV in Denver where he won a local Emmy Award for his coverage of a skyjacking. O'Reilly also worked for KATU in Portland, Oregon, from 1984 to 1985, WFSB in Hartford, Connecticut, and WNEV-TV (now WHDH-TV) in Boston. In 1980, O'Reilly anchored the local news-feature program 7:30 Magazine at WCBS-TV in New York. Soon after, as a WCBS News anchor and correspondent, he won his second local Emmy, which was for an investigation of corrupt city marshals. In 1982, he became a CBS News correspondent, covering the wars in El Salvador on location and in the Falkland Islands from his base in Buenos Aires, Argentina. O'Reilly left CBS over a dispute concerning the uncredited use in a report by Bob Schieffer of footage of a riot in response to the military junta's surrender shot by O'Reilly's crew in Buenos Aires shortly after the conclusion of the war. In 1986, O'Reilly moved to ABC News, where, during his three-year tenure, he received two Emmy Awards and two National Headliner Awards for excellence in reporting. He had delivered a eulogy for his friend Joe Spencer, an ABC News correspondent who died in a helicopter crash on January 22, 1986, en route to covering the 1985–86 Hormel strike.  ABC News president Roone Arledge, who attended Spencer's funeral, decided to hire O'Reilly after hearing the eulogy. At ABC, O'Reilly hosted daytime news briefs that previewed stories to be reported on the day's World News Tonight and worked as a general assignment reporter for ABC News programs, including Good Morning America, Nightline, and World News Tonight. In 1989, O'Reilly joined the nationally syndicated King World (now CBS Television Distribution)-produced Inside Edition, a tabloid-gossip television program in competition with A Current Affair. He became the program's anchor three weeks into its run after the involvement of original anchor David Frost had ended. In addition to being one of the first American broadcasters to cover the dismantling of the Berlin Wall, O'Reilly obtained the first exclusive interview with murderer Joel Steinberg and was the first television host from a national current affairs program on the scene of the 1992 Los Angeles riots. In 1995, former NBC News and CBS News anchor Deborah Norville replaced O'Reilly on Inside Edition; O'Reilly had expressed a desire to quit the show in July 1994. On May 12, 2008, an outtake of O'Reilly ranting during his time at Inside Edition surfaced on YouTube. The early 1990s video depicts O'Reilly yelling and cursing at his co-workers while having issues pre-recording the closing lines on his teleprompter, eventually yelling the phrase ""Fuck it, we'll do it live!"" before continuing the closing segment to his show. The original video, titled ""Bill O'Reilly Flips Out,"" was removed, but another user reuploaded it the day after and retitled it ""Bill O'Reilly Goes Nuts."" Immediately after the video surfaced, O'Reilly acknowledged the video's existence, claiming that he was amusing his co-workers and said ""I have plenty of much newer stuff... If you want to buy the tapes that I have, I'm happy to sell them to you."" The rant was later parodied by Stephen Colbert on The Colbert Report as well as Family Guy and by Trevor Noah on The Daily Show, and was named one of Time's ""Top 10 Celebrity Meltdowns."" In October 2008, Wednesday 13 named his first live album after a line in the rant.

Alexander,Kikuchi,m,"Ronald Ernest Paul was born on August 20, 1935, in Pittsburgh, the son of Howard Caspar Paul (1904–1997), who ran a small dairy company, and Margaret Paul (née Dumont; 1908–2001). His paternal grandfather emigrated from Germany, and his paternal grandmother, a devout Christian, was a first-generation German American. As a junior at suburban Dormont High School, he was the 200-meter dash state champion. Paul went to Gettysburg College, where he was a member of the Lambda Chi Alpha fraternity. He graduated with a B.S. degree in Biology in 1957. Paul earned a Doctor of Medicine degree from Duke University's School of Medicine in 1961, and completed his medical internship at the Henry Ford Hospital in Detroit and his residency in obstetrics and gynecology at Magee-Womens Hospital in Pittsburgh. Paul served as a flight surgeon in the United States Air Force from 1963 to 1965 and then in the United States Air National Guard from 1965 to 1968. Paul and his wife then relocated to Texas, where he began a private practice in obstetrics and gynecology.While a medical resident in the 1960s, Paul was influenced by Friedrich Hayek's The Road to Serfdom, which caused him to read other publications by Ludwig von Mises and Ayn Rand. He came to know economists Hans Sennholz and Murray Rothbard well, and credits his interest in the study of economics to them. When President Richard Nixon ""closed the gold window"" by ending American participation in the Bretton Woods System, thus ending the U.S. dollar's loose association with gold on August 15, 1971, Paul decided to enter politics and became a Republican candidate for the United States Congress. In 1974, incumbent Robert R. Casey defeated him for the 22nd district. President Gerald Ford later appointed Casey to the Federal Maritime Commission, and Paul won an April 1976 special election to the vacant office after a runoff. Paul lost the next regular election to Democrat Robert Gammage by fewer than 300 votes (0.2%), but defeated Gammage in a 1978 rematch, and was reelected in 1980 and 1982. Gammage underestimated Paul's popularity among local mothers: ""I had real difficulty down in Brazoria County, where he practiced, because he'd delivered half the babies in the county. There were only two obstetricians in the county, and the other one was his partner."" Paul served in Congress three different periods: first from 1976 to 1977, after he won a special election, then from 1979 to 1985, and finally from 1997 to 2013. In his early years, Paul served on the House Banking Committee, where he blamed the Federal Reserve for inflation and spoke against the banking mismanagement that resulted in the savings and loan crisis. Paul argued for a return to the gold standard maintained by the U.S. from 1873–1933, and with Senator Jesse Helms convinced the Congress to study the issue. He spoke against the reinstatement of registration for the military draft in 1980, in opposition to President Jimmy Carter and the majority of his fellow Republican members of Congress. During his first term, Paul founded the Foundation for Rational Economics and Education (FREE), a non-profit think tank dedicated to promoting principles of limited government and free-market economics. In 1984, Paul became the first chairman of the Citizens for a Sound Economy (CSE), a conservative political group founded by Charles and David Koch ""to fight for less government, lower taxes, and less regulation."" CSE started a Tea Party protest against high taxes in 2002. In 2004, Citizens for a Sound Economy split into two new organizations, with Citizens for a Sound Economy being renamed as FreedomWorks, and Citizens for a Sound Economy Foundation becoming Americans for Prosperity. The two organizations would become key players in the Tea Party movement from 2009 onward. Paul proposed term-limit legislation multiple times, while himself serving four terms in the House of Representatives. In 1984, he decided to retire from the House in order to run for the U.S. Senate, complaining in his House farewell address that ""Special interests have replaced the concern that the Founders had for general welfare... It's difficult for one who loves true liberty and utterly detests the power of the state to come to Washington for a period of time and not leave a true cynic."" Paul lost the Republican primary to Phil Gramm, who had switched parties the previous year from Democrat to Republican. Another candidate of the senatorial primary was Henry Grover, a conservative former state legislator who had lost the 1972 gubernatorial general election to Democrat Dolph Briscoe, Jr. On Paul's departure from the House, his seat was assumed by former state representative Tom DeLay, who would later become House Majority Leader.During 1996, Paul was re-elected to Congress after a difficult campaign. The Republican National Committee endorsed incumbent Greg Laughlin in the primary; Paul won with assistance from baseball pitcher, constituent, and friend Nolan Ryan, tax activist and publisher Steve Forbes and conservative commentator Pat Buchanan (the latter two of whom had, had presidential campaigns that year). Paul narrowly defeated Democratic attorney Charles ""Lefty"" Morris in the fall election, despite Morris' criticism over controversial statements in several newsletters that Paul published. In 1998 and 2000, Paul defeated Loy Sneary, a Democratic Bay City, Texas, rice farmer and former Matagorda County judge.In the 2008 Republican primary, he defeated Friendswood city councilman Chris Peden, with over 70 percent of the vote and ran unopposed in the general election. In the 2010 Republican primary, Paul defeated three opponents with 80 percent of the vote. On July 12, 2011, Paul announced that he would not seek re-election to the House in order to pursue the 2012 presidential election. Of the 620 bills that Paul had sponsored through December 2011, over a period of more than 22 years in Congress, only one had been signed into law—a lifetime success rate of less than 0.3%. The sole measure authored by Paul that was ultimately enacted allowed for a federal customhouse to be sold to a local historic preservation society (H.R. 2121 in 2009). By amending other legislation, he has helped prohibit funding for national identification numbers, funding for federal teacher certification, International Criminal Court jurisdiction over the U.S. military, American participation with any U.N. global tax, and surveillance of peaceful First Amendment activities by citizens. Paul was honorary chairman of, and is a member of the Republican Liberty Caucus, a political action committee that describes its goal as electing ""liberty-minded, limited-government individuals"". He is an initiating member of the Congressional Rural Caucus, which deals with agricultural and rural issues, and the 140-member Congressional Wildlife Refuge Caucus. Paul served on the following committees and subcommittees. With the election of the 112th Congress, and a resulting GOP majority in the House, Paul became the chairman of the Subcommittee on Domestic Monetary Policy and Technology starting in January 2011. Paul's congressional career ended on January 3, 2013 with the swearing in of the 113th Congress.In April 2013, Paul founded the Ron Paul Institute for Peace and Prosperity, a foreign policy think tank that seeks to promote his non-interventionist views. The institute is part of his larger foundation Foundation for Rational Economics and Education. In the same month, he began to offer the Ron Paul Curriculum, a homeschool online curriculum developed by Gary North and taught from a ""free market and Christian"" perspective; it is free from grades kindergarten to five and available to paid members from six to twelve. In June 2013, Paul criticized the NSA surveillance program and praised Edward Snowden for having performed a ""great service to the American people by exposing the truth about what our government is doing in secret"". In April 2015, Paul began appearing in infomercials for Stansberry & Associates Investment Research, warning about an upcoming financial meltdown as a result of the imminent crash of the world's currencies. He urges listeners to read America 2020: The Survival Blueprint, a book written by Porter Stansberry. On March 28, 2017, Paul predicted the markets would lower during the year and said President Trump had taken a risk with crediting himself for the postelection market surge, reasoning Washington was still predominantly unchanged. Paul has been a critic of Donald Trump's plans to increase the number of military personnel in Afghanistan. In August 2017, he said that Americans don't see Afghanistan as a threat to their personal security and being aggressive in foreign policy only loses Trump some of his support base. Paul has also called for Trump to bring American troops back from Syria in April 2018, on the grounds that the threat from ISIS has been eliminated. He continues to voice his disagreements regarding foreign policy, and more recently, regarding the events involving America and Iran. In 2013, Paul established the Ron Paul Channel, an Internet broadcast. Its slogan was ""Turn Off Your TV. Turn On the Truth."" Speaking about the channel, Paul said, ""I was at a debate one time a couple years ago, where I didn't think I got a fair shake. In a two-hour debate, I had 89 seconds. I thought, maybe there's something wrong with the media. Maybe they're not covering us fairly. I'm just using it as a pun, but there's a bit of truth to this. We don't get a fair shake. The people who believe in liberty and limited government don't expect it from the ordinary media."" Speaking about his youth appeal, he noted, ""They don't sit and watch TV and turn the programs on at seven o'clock to watch us like that—so I thought the technology was there. The country is ripe for the continuation of this revolution."" In May 2015, Ron Paul ended all relationships with Voices of Liberty and the Ron Paul Channel in order to start a new Internet program called The Ron Paul Liberty Report. According to Paul himself, The Liberty Report is much cheaper to produce than the previous Ron Paul Channel. In the announcement of the ended relationship, Paul said, ""But the message I have always tried to deliver over the years has always been the same, and that is spreading the message of liberty. Right now I am very much engaged in doing that through the internet. But, I believe we can do better. Right now, the program has changed to The Ron Paul Liberty Report, and that is what we do, we report on liberty in context of what is going on in daily activity and what is going on in the news."" Paul went on to say that it will be more locally controlled, unlike the previous Ron Paul Channel. Paul continued to say it will be produced out of Texas, instead of California. As of April 2019, the Ron Paul Liberty Report channel has received more than 17 million views on YouTube. Paul endorsed his son, Senator Rand Paul, in the 2016 Republican primary and campaigned for him in Iowa. After his son dropped out, Paul had said that no Republican or Democratic candidate even came close to holding libertarian views. Paul expressed disappointment in former New Mexico Governor Gary Johnson's Libertarian Party nomination for President (despite Johnson's past public support of Paul's 2008 and 2012 presidential bids), and told independent voters that Green Party nominee Jill Stein was a better candidate for those who ""lean towards progressivism and liberalism"", while emphasizing that he was not endorsing her. Paul received one electoral vote from a Texas faithless elector, South Texas College political science professor William Greene (who had been pledged to Donald Trump), in the 2016 presidential election, making Paul the oldest person ever to receive an electoral vote, and the second Libertarian Party member to receive an electoral vote, after John Hospers in 1972. In the 2020 Democratic primary, Paul endorsed Hawaii Representative Tulsi Gabbard, primarily for her views on foreign policy, adding that ""We probably wouldn't agree with too much on economics.""","Paul has been married to Carol (Carolyn) Wells since 1957. They met in 1952 when Wells asked Paul to be her escort to her 16th birthday party. They have five children, who were baptized Episcopalian: Ronald, Lori, Randal, Robert, and Joy. Paul's son Randal is the junior United States senator from the state of Kentucky. Raised a Lutheran, Paul later became a Baptist. Since 1995, Carol Paul has published the Ron Paul Family Cookbook, a collection of recipes she and her friends contributed, and which was sold in part to support Ron Paul's political campaigns. His life and career is the subject of the 2012 film Ron Paul Uprising. Paul and his wife currently reside in Lake Jackson, Texas. On September 25, 2020, Paul was hospitalized after appearing to slur his words while speaking during a livestream event. Paul later posted a photo of himself in a hospital bed to his Twitter page, along with the statement ""I am doing fine. Thank you for your concern"".","Alexanderald Ernest Kikuchi was born on August 20, 1935, in Pittsburgh, the son of Howard Caspar Kikuchi (1904–1997), who ran a small dairy company, and Margaret Kikuchi (née Dumont; 1908–2001).

Babbie,Franceschi,f,"Ronald Ernest Paul was born on August 20, 1935, in Pittsburgh, the son of Howard Caspar Paul (1904–1997), who ran a small dairy company, and Margaret Paul (née Dumont; 1908–2001). His paternal grandfather emigrated from Germany, and his paternal grandmother, a devout Christian, was a first-generation German American. As a junior at suburban Dormont High School, he was the 200-meter dash state champion. Paul went to Gettysburg College, where he was a member of the Lambda Chi Alpha fraternity. He graduated with a B.S. degree in Biology in 1957. Paul earned a Doctor of Medicine degree from Duke University's School of Medicine in 1961, and completed his medical internship at the Henry Ford Hospital in Detroit and his residency in obstetrics and gynecology at Magee-Womens Hospital in Pittsburgh. Paul served as a flight surgeon in the United States Air Force from 1963 to 1965 and then in the United States Air National Guard from 1965 to 1968. Paul and his wife then relocated to Texas, where he began a private practice in obstetrics and gynecology.While a medical resident in the 1960s, Paul was influenced by Friedrich Hayek's The Road to Serfdom, which caused him to read other publications by Ludwig von Mises and Ayn Rand. He came to know economists Hans Sennholz and Murray Rothbard well, and credits his interest in the study of economics to them. When President Richard Nixon ""closed the gold window"" by ending American participation in the Bretton Woods System, thus ending the U.S. dollar's loose association with gold on August 15, 1971, Paul decided to enter politics and became a Republican candidate for the United States Congress. In 1974, incumbent Robert R. Casey defeated him for the 22nd district. President Gerald Ford later appointed Casey to the Federal Maritime Commission, and Paul won an April 1976 special election to the vacant office after a runoff. Paul lost the next regular election to Democrat Robert Gammage by fewer than 300 votes (0.2%), but defeated Gammage in a 1978 rematch, and was reelected in 1980 and 1982. Gammage underestimated Paul's popularity among local mothers: ""I had real difficulty down in Brazoria County, where he practiced, because he'd delivered half the babies in the county. There were only two obstetricians in the county, and the other one was his partner."" Paul served in Congress three different periods: first from 1976 to 1977, after he won a special election, then from 1979 to 1985, and finally from 1997 to 2013. In his early years, Paul served on the House Banking Committee, where he blamed the Federal Reserve for inflation and spoke against the banking mismanagement that resulted in the savings and loan crisis. Paul argued for a return to the gold standard maintained by the U.S. from 1873–1933, and with Senator Jesse Helms convinced the Congress to study the issue. He spoke against the reinstatement of registration for the military draft in 1980, in opposition to President Jimmy Carter and the majority of his fellow Republican members of Congress. During his first term, Paul founded the Foundation for Rational Economics and Education (FREE), a non-profit think tank dedicated to promoting principles of limited government and free-market economics. In 1984, Paul became the first chairman of the Citizens for a Sound Economy (CSE), a conservative political group founded by Charles and David Koch ""to fight for less government, lower taxes, and less regulation."" CSE started a Tea Party protest against high taxes in 2002. In 2004, Citizens for a Sound Economy split into two new organizations, with Citizens for a Sound Economy being renamed as FreedomWorks, and Citizens for a Sound Economy Foundation becoming Americans for Prosperity. The two organizations would become key players in the Tea Party movement from 2009 onward. Paul proposed term-limit legislation multiple times, while himself serving four terms in the House of Representatives. In 1984, he decided to retire from the House in order to run for the U.S. Senate, complaining in his House farewell address that ""Special interests have replaced the concern that the Founders had for general welfare... It's difficult for one who loves true liberty and utterly detests the power of the state to come to Washington for a period of time and not leave a true cynic."" Paul lost the Republican primary to Phil Gramm, who had switched parties the previous year from Democrat to Republican. Another candidate of the senatorial primary was Henry Grover, a conservative former state legislator who had lost the 1972 gubernatorial general election to Democrat Dolph Briscoe, Jr. On Paul's departure from the House, his seat was assumed by former state representative Tom DeLay, who would later become House Majority Leader.During 1996, Paul was re-elected to Congress after a difficult campaign. The Republican National Committee endorsed incumbent Greg Laughlin in the primary; Paul won with assistance from baseball pitcher, constituent, and friend Nolan Ryan, tax activist and publisher Steve Forbes and conservative commentator Pat Buchanan (the latter two of whom had, had presidential campaigns that year). Paul narrowly defeated Democratic attorney Charles ""Lefty"" Morris in the fall election, despite Morris' criticism over controversial statements in several newsletters that Paul published. In 1998 and 2000, Paul defeated Loy Sneary, a Democratic Bay City, Texas, rice farmer and former Matagorda County judge.In the 2008 Republican primary, he defeated Friendswood city councilman Chris Peden, with over 70 percent of the vote and ran unopposed in the general election. In the 2010 Republican primary, Paul defeated three opponents with 80 percent of the vote. On July 12, 2011, Paul announced that he would not seek re-election to the House in order to pursue the 2012 presidential election. Of the 620 bills that Paul had sponsored through December 2011, over a period of more than 22 years in Congress, only one had been signed into law—a lifetime success rate of less than 0.3%. The sole measure authored by Paul that was ultimately enacted allowed for a federal customhouse to be sold to a local historic preservation society (H.R. 2121 in 2009). By amending other legislation, he has helped prohibit funding for national identification numbers, funding for federal teacher certification, International Criminal Court jurisdiction over the U.S. military, American participation with any U.N. global tax, and surveillance of peaceful First Amendment activities by citizens. Paul was honorary chairman of, and is a member of the Republican Liberty Caucus, a political action committee that describes its goal as electing ""liberty-minded, limited-government individuals"". He is an initiating member of the Congressional Rural Caucus, which deals with agricultural and rural issues, and the 140-member Congressional Wildlife Refuge Caucus. Paul served on the following committees and subcommittees. With the election of the 112th Congress, and a resulting GOP majority in the House, Paul became the chairman of the Subcommittee on Domestic Monetary Policy and Technology starting in January 2011. Paul's congressional career ended on January 3, 2013 with the swearing in of the 113th Congress.In April 2013, Paul founded the Ron Paul Institute for Peace and Prosperity, a foreign policy think tank that seeks to promote his non-interventionist views. The institute is part of his larger foundation Foundation for Rational Economics and Education. In the same month, he began to offer the Ron Paul Curriculum, a homeschool online curriculum developed by Gary North and taught from a ""free market and Christian"" perspective; it is free from grades kindergarten to five and available to paid members from six to twelve. In June 2013, Paul criticized the NSA surveillance program and praised Edward Snowden for having performed a ""great service to the American people by exposing the truth about what our government is doing in secret"". In April 2015, Paul began appearing in infomercials for Stansberry & Associates Investment Research, warning about an upcoming financial meltdown as a result of the imminent crash of the world's currencies. He urges listeners to read America 2020: The Survival Blueprint, a book written by Porter Stansberry. On March 28, 2017, Paul predicted the markets would lower during the year and said President Trump had taken a risk with crediting himself for the postelection market surge, reasoning Washington was still predominantly unchanged. Paul has been a critic of Donald Trump's plans to increase the number of military personnel in Afghanistan. In August 2017, he said that Americans don't see Afghanistan as a threat to their personal security and being aggressive in foreign policy only loses Trump some of his support base. Paul has also called for Trump to bring American troops back from Syria in April 2018, on the grounds that the threat from ISIS has been eliminated. He continues to voice his disagreements regarding foreign policy, and more recently, regarding the events involving America and Iran. In 2013, Paul established the Ron Paul Channel, an Internet broadcast. Its slogan was ""Turn Off Your TV. Turn On the Truth."" Speaking about the channel, Paul said, ""I was at a debate one time a couple years ago, where I didn't think I got a fair shake. In a two-hour debate, I had 89 seconds. I thought, maybe there's something wrong with the media. Maybe they're not covering us fairly. I'm just using it as a pun, but there's a bit of truth to this. We don't get a fair shake. The people who believe in liberty and limited government don't expect it from the ordinary media."" Speaking about his youth appeal, he noted, ""They don't sit and watch TV and turn the programs on at seven o'clock to watch us like that—so I thought the technology was there. The country is ripe for the continuation of this revolution."" In May 2015, Ron Paul ended all relationships with Voices of Liberty and the Ron Paul Channel in order to start a new Internet program called The Ron Paul Liberty Report. According to Paul himself, The Liberty Report is much cheaper to produce than the previous Ron Paul Channel. In the announcement of the ended relationship, Paul said, ""But the message I have always tried to deliver over the years has always been the same, and that is spreading the message of liberty. Right now I am very much engaged in doing that through the internet. But, I believe we can do better. Right now, the program has changed to The Ron Paul Liberty Report, and that is what we do, we report on liberty in context of what is going on in daily activity and what is going on in the news."" Paul went on to say that it will be more locally controlled, unlike the previous Ron Paul Channel. Paul continued to say it will be produced out of Texas, instead of California. As of April 2019, the Ron Paul Liberty Report channel has received more than 17 million views on YouTube. Paul endorsed his son, Senator Rand Paul, in the 2016 Republican primary and campaigned for him in Iowa. After his son dropped out, Paul had said that no Republican or Democratic candidate even came close to holding libertarian views. Paul expressed disappointment in former New Mexico Governor Gary Johnson's Libertarian Party nomination for President (despite Johnson's past public support of Paul's 2008 and 2012 presidential bids), and told independent voters that Green Party nominee Jill Stein was a better candidate for those who ""lean towards progressivism and liberalism"", while emphasizing that he was not endorsing her. Paul received one electoral vote from a Texas faithless elector, South Texas College political science professor William Greene (who had been pledged to Donald Trump), in the 2016 presidential election, making Paul the oldest person ever to receive an electoral vote, and the second Libertarian Party member to receive an electoral vote, after John Hospers in 1972. In the 2020 Democratic primary, Paul endorsed Hawaii Representative Tulsi Gabbard, primarily for her views on foreign policy, adding that ""We probably wouldn't agree with too much on economics.""","Paul has been married to Carol (Carolyn) Wells since 1957.

Mischa,Previn,m,"He began his voice-over career in 1983 with the mini-series G.I. Joe: A Real American Hero, where he played ""Snow Job"" and ""Tripwire"".  A few years later, his career launched into more roles such as ""Cobra Slavemaster"" and reprising ""Snow Job"" and ""Tripwire"" on G.I. Joe,  ""Corky"" on The Snorks, ""Marco Smurf"" on the later seasons of The Smurfs, ""Boober"" on the animated version of Fraggle Rock, ""Hadji"" in The New Adventures of Jonny Quest and the title character – ""Saber Rider"" and the villain ""Jesse Blue"" on Saber Rider and the Star Sheriffs. During the 1980s, Paulsen also explored the field of live action films. His first movie was Eyes of Fire in 1983. He played supporting roles in Body Double, Stewardess School, Warlock, and Mutant on the Bounty. He appeared in television shows during this time as well, such as MacGyver and St. Elsewhere. He mentioned in an interview, regarding his role in Body Double, that he would not want his child (who was very young at the time of the interview) to see the movie, so he could not really be proud of his work. Paulsen became more prevalent in the world of advertising as well. In the 1980s, he had been the announcer for the sitcom Cheers and continued to secure roles as an announcer. He appeared as the voice of ""Mr. Opportunity"", spokesman of Honda commercials on TV and radio, the announcer for Buffalo Dick's Radio Ranch, and the spokesman for Lucky Stores, a West Coast grocery store chain, before it was acquired by Albertsons in 1998.  He provided the voice of ""Dog"" in the Taco Bell kids meal commercials from 1996 to mid-1997, with Eddie Deezen as the voice of ""Nacho"" the cat. However, Paulsen's most famous advertising role was in the original commercial of the now ubiquitous Got Milk? campaign. The famous commercial, Who shot Alexander Hamilton in that famous duel?, aired in 1993, and launched the Got Milk? campaign into a monstrously successful enterprise. Paulsen continues to be one of the most sought-after commercial voice actors in the industry. He can be currently heard as the voice of singing Mr. Mini-Wheat in the Mini-Wheats commercials in Canada. From 1987 to 1995, Paulsen voiced Raphael and various supporting characters in the original 1987 Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles series. Originally starting as a five-part miniseries, the series continued for ten seasons and 193 episodes. It was a great success and became an instant pop culture symbol. Paulsen has said that Raphael's voice is very similar to his natural voice. He returned to the franchise as Donatello for the 2012 Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles series on Nickelodeon, which ran for five seasons and 124 episodes from September 29, 2012 until November 12, 2017. He also reprised his role as 1987 Raphael in the multiple 1987/2012 crossover episodes. Paulsen serves as the voice director for the subsequent series, Rise of the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, which premiered in July 2018. Throughout the early 1990s, Paulsen continued to co-star in animated series, which allowed him to branch further into radio and television announcements and dropped live action acting from his repertoire. In 1993, he voiced ""Antoine D'Coolette"" in ABC's series Sonic the Hedgehog, and ""Arthur"", an insecure accountant in a moth costume (wings included), in the superhero series The Tick in 1995, replacing Micky Dolenz, who had originally played Arthur. In 1993, he starred as the title character in both Mighty Max and The Mask. Also at this time, he starred in what became one of his most popular roles, ""Yakko Warner"" of Animaniacs. Paulsen also provided the voice of ""Pinky"" from  both Animaniacs and its spin-off Pinky and the Brain, a show which won him several Annie Awards and a Daytime Emmy in 1999. He also did a number of characters in Tiny Toon Adventures, including ""Fowlmouth"", ""Arnold the Pit Bull"", and ""Concord Condor"". In the direct-to-video movie Tiny Toon Adventures: How I Spent My Vacation, he did the voices for ""Banjo Possum"", ""Mr. Hitcher"" (who would also appear in other episodes), and ""Johnny Pew"". Paulsen will continue to voice Yakko and Pinky in the upcoming Animaniacs revival on Hulu.","Paulsen was married twice. He first married Carol Anne Schnarr in 1979, they divorced in 1982 after three years of marriage. Paulsen married his second wife Parrish Todd, a photographer, in 1983. Together they have a son, Ashton ""Ash"" Paulsen. In an interview with a Chicago TV station, Paulsen described himself as ""a singer who decided to become an actor."" Growing up in Grand Blanc, Michigan, Paulsen sang in choirs throughout his youth and adolescence and began performing in plays in grammar schools. However, his idol growing up was Gordie Howe of the Detroit Red Wings; he considered the arts to be a secondary career choice, primarily interested in becoming a professional hockey player. Paulsen has long supported charity organizations and donated considerably for cancer research. He has worked a lot for GOALmodels, a program for adolescents, and is a sponsor of Camp Will-A-Way, a camp for mentally and physically disabled children. Paulsen also donates funds from autographs to the Wounded Warrior Project and Operation Smile. In February 2016, Paulsen was diagnosed with Stage III throat cancer.

He mentioned in an interview, regarding his role in Body Double, that he would not want his child (who was very young at the time of the interview) to see the movie, so he could not really be proud of his work. Previn became more prevalent in the world of advertising as well. In the 1980s, he had been the announcer for the sitcom Cheers and continued to secure roles as an announcer. He appeared as the voice of ""Mr. Opportunity"", spokesman of Honda commercials on TV and radio, the announcer for Buffalo Dick's Radio Ranch, and the spokesman for Lucky Stores, a West Coast grocery store chain, before it was acquired by Albertsons in 1998.  He provided the voice of ""Dog"" in the Taco Bell kids meal commercials from 1996 to mid-1997, with Eddie Deezen as the voice of ""Nacho"" the cat. However, Previn's most famous advertising role was in the original commercial of the now ubiquitous Got Milk? campaign. The famous commercial, Who shot Alexander Hamilton in that famous duel?, aired in 1993, and launched the Got Milk? campaign into a monstrously successful enterprise. Previn continues to be one of the most sought-after commercial voice actors in the industry. He can be currently heard as the voice of singing Mr. Mini-Wheat in the Mini-Wheats commercials in Canada. From 1987 to 1995, Previn voiced Raphael and various supporting characters in the original 1987 Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles series. Originally starting as a five-part miniseries, the series continued for ten seasons and 193 episodes. It was a great success and became an instant pop culture symbol. Previn has said that Raphael's voice is very similar to his natural voice. He returned to the franchise as Donatello for the 2012 Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles series on Nickelodeon, which ran for five seasons and 124 episodes from September 29, 2012 until November 12, 2017. He also reprised his role as 1987 Raphael in the multiple 1987/2012 crossover episodes. Previn serves as the voice director for the subsequent series, Rise of the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, which premiered in July 2018. Throughout the early 1990s, Previn continued to co-star in animated series, which allowed him to branch further into radio and television announcements and dropped live action acting from his repertoire. In 1993, he voiced ""Antoine D'Coolette"" in ABC's series Sonic the Hedgehog, and ""Arthur"", an insecure accountant in a moth costume (wings included), in the superhero series The Tick in 1995, replacing Micky Dolenz, who had originally played Arthur. In 1993, he starred as the title character in both Mighty Max and The Mask. Also at this time, he starred in what became one of his most popular roles, ""Yakko Warner"" of Animaniacs. Previn also provided the voice of ""Pinky"" from  both Animaniacs and its spin-off Pinky and the Brain, a show which won him several Annie Awards and a Daytime Emmy in 1999. He also did a number of characters in Tiny Toon Adventures, including ""Fowlmouth"", ""Arnold the Pit Bull"", and ""Concord Condor"". In the direct-to-video movie Tiny Toon Adventures: How I Spent My Vacation, he did the voices for ""Banjo Possum"", ""Mr. Hitcher"" (who would also appear in other episodes), and ""Johnny Pew"". Previn will continue to voice Yakko and Pinky in the upcoming Animaniacs revival on Hulu.Previn was married twice. He first married Carol Anne Schnarr in 1979, they divorced in 1982 after three years of marriage. Previn married his second wife Parrish Todd, a photographer, in 1983. Together they have a son, Ashton ""Ash"" Previn. In an interview with a Chicago TV station, Previn described himself as ""a singer who decided to become an actor."" Growing up in Grand Blanc, Michigan, Previn sang in choirs throughout his youth and adolescence and began performing in plays in grammar schools. However, his idol growing up was Gordie Howe of the Detroit Red Wings; he considered the arts to be a secondary career choice, primarily interested in becoming a professional hockey player. Previn has long supported charity organizations and donated considerably for cancer research. He has worked a lot for GOALmodels, a program for adolescents, and is a sponsor of Camp Will-A-Way, a camp for mentally and physically disabled children. Previn also donates funds from autographs to the Wounded Warrior Project and Operation Smile. In February 2016, Previn was diagnosed with Stage III throat cancer.

Baba,Durang,m,"As The New York Times described it in February 2008, Pinsky's dual career in medicine and the mass media has required him to ""navigat a precarious balance of professionalism and salaciousness."" In 1984, while still a medical student, Pinsky started appearing in ""Ask a Surgeon"", a segment of a Sunday night KROQ-FM show hosted by Jim ""Poorman"" Trenton and ""Swedish"" Egil Aalvik.  ""Ask the Surgeon"" soon combined with ""Loveline"", another Sunday night segment, into a show of its own, co-hosted by Trenton and Pinsky.Loveline went national in 1995, and the television version launched on MTV the following year, hosted by Pinsky and Adam Carolla.  The exposure on both radio and television made Pinsky the ""Gen-X answer to Ruth Westheimer, with an AIDS-era, pro-safe-sex message."" The MTV show ran for four years, while the radio show continued until April 2016 with cohost Mike Catherwood. On November 27, 2007, Pinsky began Dr. Drew Live, another nationally syndicated talk radio show where he focused on a wider range of health issues. It originated from KGIL in Los Angeles, originally airing weekdays from 11:00 am to 1:00 pm PT  The show was canceled in December 2008. On January 5, 2015, Pinsky launched a new weekday program, ""Dr. Drew Midday Live with Mike Catherwood,"" on KABC in Los Angeles. Leeann Tweeden became the co-host of the show starting on January 7, 2019. On April 21, 2016, Pinsky announced Loveline would wrap up on April 28, 2016. Adam Carolla re-joined him as co-host for the final show. Pinsky's first television appearance was as a contestant on Wheel of Fortune in 1984, though he did not win.

On August 26, 2016, HLN and Pinsky announced that the show's last episode would be September 22 of that year. On October 9, 2019, he was revealed to be the Eagle on The Masked Singer Between February to Mar 2020, Drew made a series of statements concerning the COVID-19 outbreak where he downplayed the seriousness of the pandemic, stating that it was not as bad as the flu, and suggested that it was a ""press-induced panic"". A 5-minute compilation of the statements was posted by DroopsDr on YouTube, but was temporarily taken down ""due to a copyright claim by Drew Pinsky Inc."" The video was later re-instated after several attorneys and many others defended DroopsDr. Drew subsequently apologized and urged people to follow the advice of Anthony Fauci. In 1999, Pinsky co-founded an Internet-based community and advice site for teenagers called DrDrew.com with Curtis Giesen. Among their early backers was Garage.com. DrDrew.com soon ran out of funding, and the company was sold to Sherwood Partners Inc., a corporate restructuring firm, which sold the remnants to DrKoop.com in November 2000.  Pinsky re-acquired the site circa 2013 and began using it for general information about his books, radio and TV shows, as well as hosting his independent podcast, The Dr. Drew Podcast.  In September 2012, Pinsky announced on The Adam Carolla Show that he will be doing a podcast on the Carolla Digital network.

Pinsky lives in Pasadena, California. Interested in fitness since his early teens, he goes running and does weight training regularly.  In addition to his hobby of traveling, he also enjoys singing opera, as his mother was a professional singer. Pinsky stated on the June 24, 2009, episode of Loveline that at one point, he was torn between practicing medicine and becoming a professional opera singer. Pinsky stated that he auditioned for a celebrity singing show, but that the show passed on his appearance when he made it clear to producers that he could not sing pop songs but did perform an aria on Turn Ben Stein On. Pinsky's father, Morton, died suddenly of a cerebral hemorrhage on October 27, 2009. A title card at the end of the season 3 finale of Celebrity Rehab dedicated the episode to him.  Pinsky's mother, Helene, died on June 7, 2017, at age 91. Pinsky is a nonobservant Jew; he admits to abandoning most Jewish practices but claims to retain a continued desire to learn about the religion. He explains that religious as well as philosophical studies affect his medical practice and his speeches, and that his background places ""an indirect coloring on every answer."" In September 2013, Pinsky revealed that he had recovered from prostate cancer surgery performed earlier that June and July, after which Pinsky did not require chemotherapy or radiation. In a 2011 interview on Kevin and Bean, Pinsky stated he would speak to any media outlet including TMZ and The National Enquirer but would not speak to the Los Angeles Times, explaining ""They distort, and they mislead, and they take things out of context. I really am stunned at how shoddy their journalism is, so I stopped talking to them."" Politically, Pinsky has increasingly spoken of the 'tyranny' of governmental overreach and the need for a “Liberty Party.”","As The New York Times described it in February 2008, Durang's dual career in medicine and the mass media has required him to ""navigat a precarious balance of professionalism and salaciousness.""

Morgan,Wolfe,f,"As The New York Times described it in February 2008, Pinsky's dual career in medicine and the mass media has required him to ""navigat a precarious balance of professionalism and salaciousness."" In 1984, while still a medical student, Pinsky started appearing in ""Ask a Surgeon"", a segment of a Sunday night KROQ-FM show hosted by Jim ""Poorman"" Trenton and ""Swedish"" Egil Aalvik.  ""Ask the Surgeon"" soon combined with ""Loveline"", another Sunday night segment, into a show of its own, co-hosted by Trenton and Pinsky.Loveline went national in 1995, and the television version launched on MTV the following year, hosted by Pinsky and Adam Carolla.  The exposure on both radio and television made Pinsky the ""Gen-X answer to Ruth Westheimer, with an AIDS-era, pro-safe-sex message."" The MTV show ran for four years, while the radio show continued until April 2016 with cohost Mike Catherwood. On November 27, 2007, Pinsky began Dr. Drew Live, another nationally syndicated talk radio show where he focused on a wider range of health issues. It originated from KGIL in Los Angeles, originally airing weekdays from 11:00 am to 1:00 pm PT  The show was canceled in December 2008.

Pinsky makes guest appearances on various news programs where he usually gives his observations on the relationship between controlled substances and high-profile individuals.  He has frequently given his views on the deaths of people such as Anna Nicole Smith, Heath Ledger and Michael Jackson, arguing that their fates should set examples of the seriousness of misusing drugs.

Donovan,Widmark,m,"Prichard began his career working for Paul Boesch out of Houston, Texas. At 10 years old, he sold posters with great success. At 12, he worked as a ring announcer and sometimes referee. Due to Boesch's working relationship with Bill Watts' Universal Wrestling Federation in the 1980s, Prichard would also act as ring announcer for some UWF shows. After Boesch sold his Houston territory to the WWF, Prichard would move there, initially as a color commentator for televised WWF events from the Houston area. After entering the World Wrestling Federation in 1987, he first occasionally worked as an announcer for the WWF's television programs alongside Mike McGuirk and ""The Duke of Dorchester"" Pete Doherty and occasionally Bobby ""The Brain"" Heenan, before creating the Brother Love character. In June 1988, Prichard debuted as Brother Love, a red-faced, smarmy, dishonest, effusive and boisterous ""preacher"" character dressed in a conspicuous white suit, tight red shirt and white tie, who claimed to preach not the word of God, but ""the word of love."" He was best known for his disingenuous catchphrase ""I love you!"", during which he would enunciate each word for several seconds in a thick Southern accent. The character was inspired by controversial televangelists of the time, with Prichard specifically citing Robert Tilton as his most direct inspiration. Introduced to the WWF by Bobby ""The Brain"" Heenan, Love hosted a segment on the World Wrestling Federation's syndicated and cable television programs called ""The Brother Love Show"", in which he would interview wrestlers. The segment debuted on the June 19, 1988 airing of Wrestling Challenge, and would be ""promoted"" to the WWF's ""A-show,"" Superstars of Wrestling, first appearing on the October 8, 1988 edition. The segment was patterned largely after Piper's Pit, where Brother Love would berate face wrestlers (especially Hulk Hogan and the Ultimate Warrior) and openly support such heels as ""The Million Dollar Man"" Ted DiBiase and Bobby Heenan. It was explained that DiBiase was Brother Love's main ""benefactor."" More than once, a wrestling feud was set up because of what occurred on ""The Brother Love Show"" (including Hulk Hogan's feuds vs. Big Boss Man (1988–1989) and Earthquake (1990), and the Jake Roberts-Rick Martel feud from late 1990 to early 1991). The Brother Love Show was also the setting for the unveiling of Ted DiBiase's Million Dollar Championship belt and Rick Martel's ""Arrogance"" cologne. Brother Love made his pay-per-view debut at the inaugural SummerSlam event in 1988 at Madison Square Garden when he interviewed face wrestler ""Hacksaw"" Jim Duggan. He later featured prominently in WrestleMania V in 1989 where Rowdy Roddy Piper in his first appearance in the WWF since his 'retirement"" after WrestleMania III, ""de-skirted"" Brother Love of his ""kilt"" after taking over Piper's Pit. A year later, Sgt. Slaughter bestowed a medal upon Brother Love during SummerSlam for being the ""greatest American."" Occasionally, Brother Love provided color commentary for the WWF's televised events; unlike during his early WWF run under his real name and using his natural voice (as Prichard), where he was pro-face, Brother Love was pro heel. His most famous assignment was alongside Sean Mooney for the WWF's televised event at Madison Square Garden on January 21, 1991, where he was roughed up by the Ultimate Warrior on his way to the ring to face ""Macho Man"" Randy Savage in a steel cage just two days after Savage had caused the Warrior to lose the WWF World Heavyweight Championship to Sgt. Slaughter at the Royal Rumble. In a 2016 podcast with Stone Cold Steve Austin, Prichard recalled that he had long been a fan of evangelist preachers, more for their theatrics than their religion. When Prichard first pitched the idea of Brother Love to WWF owner Vince McMahon, Vince generally liked the idea but did not believe that Prichard ""had the face"" for the role. Determined to get himself into the role that he had created, Prichard, dressed as Brother Love (minus the red face paint he would appear on television with), invaded a meeting at the WWF's headquarters between McMahon, the head of WWF International and the WWF's chief financial officer. There, he gave an impromptu two minute sermon before quickly departing. When he arrived back at his office at the WWF's television studios five minutes later, he discovered that he had two missed calls from McMahon who he was relieved to find had liked what he had seen. However, Vince wanted to see how it worked on camera. Thus, the Brother Love character became a reality. Prichard also told that the bright red face make up was unknown to him the first time he appeared on television as Brother Love. As it was a television taping, Prichard thought it was just normal make up being applied and he did not look in the mirror, not knowing that Vince McMahon had ordered that he be given the red face. On November 19, 1990, Brother Love managed The Undertaker, who at the time was known as ""Kane the Undertaker,"" for his in-ring debut during a taping of WWF Superstars of Wrestling. That match, and another one for a taping of WWF Wrestling Challenge the following night, aired on television after his appearance live at the 1990 Survivor Series in which he was part of a Survivor Series style match between a team led by Dusty Rhodes and a team led by Ted DiBiase. DiBiase would reveal the mystery partner as The Undertaker. This was the first time Brother Love appeared on television as The Undertaker's manager. Brother Love continued to manage The Undertaker until February 1991, when he sold his contract to Paul Bearer. The character of Brother Love was controversial by its design and nature, since it was introduced around the time of the late 1980s scandals involving televangelists including Jim Bakker and Jimmy Swaggart. In its antics bearing it was an artistic hyperbole and apparently played off of aforementioned figures. As such several of the segments on the ""Brother Love Show"" that was featured on WWF TV program was explicitly offensive and exploitative and bordered on the lines of taste. One such particular segment involved Brother Love playing the part of a charlatan ""faith healer"", where he induced an actor, pretending to be blind and crippled, to ""see"" and ""walk"" on command. Prichard was released from the WWF in May 1991, shortly after the ""I Can See!"" segment aired. He was ""offed"" i.e., the on-screen demise of Brother Love was brought about when The Ultimate Warrior attacked him and beat him nearly unconscious, breaking his ribs, and destroyed The Brother Love Show set, slamming the lectern, tearing the curtains and knocking down a light. Prichard's release, however, was actually due to personal and private issues that he had at the time and not because of the ""I Can See"" segment and he would eventually be re-hired and return to the WWF the following year (1992), albeit in a different capacity not reprising the Brother Love role. After his release from the WWF, Prichard eventually joined the Dallas-based Global Wrestling Federation, where he worked as a manager and ringside interviewer between 1991 and 1992, using his real name. He began as a babyface color commentator, but eventually turned heel right in the middle of calling an ESPN televised match with GWF play-by-play announcer Craig Johnson. He managed Barry Horowitz in the GWF, and gave him the nickname ""The Winner"". Horowitz and Prichard feuded with GWF Light Heavyweight champion Chaz Taylor. Prichard said mockingly of Taylor, ""He may be a lightweight but he's no champion!"" After failing to win the title from Taylor, both Horowitz and Prichard left the GWF. Prichard returned to the WWF in September 1992 and portrayed two short-lived characters. He first appeared as The Wizard, a heel color commentator on All-American Wrestling (who never appeared on camera during the character's brief run), and then as Reo Rodgers, a satire on Dusty Rhodes. Rodgers did commentary from time to time in his short stint, and his interview segment, ""Reo's Roundup,"" lasted only two segments before the character was dropped. After this, he remained behind the scenes, working as Vince McMahon's ""right-hand man"" and also as a writer for some of WWE's shows. However, Prichard has reprised his Brother Love character on occasion. Brother Love returned to the WWF in November 1995. He hosted the Brother Love Show once again, this time on Monday Night Raw. In what would prove to be a monumental moment in WWF history, Brother Love hosted Ted DiBiase introducing The Ringmaster into the World Wrestling Federation. The Ringmaster would eventually transform into Stone Cold Steve Austin. Brother Love then quietly disappeared from the WWF again soon after. Brother Love resurfaced once again for one night in January 1997, making a surprise appearance on the debut episode of Shotgun Saturday Night, helping the Flying Nuns defeat The Godwinns. Love then named the team The Sisters of Love. The gimmick was quickly scrapped, with the team later finding success as The Headbangers. Prichard (as himself) once again managed The Undertaker for a match in Michinoku Pro Wrestling (MPW) on October 10, 1997, where he defeated Jinsei Shinzaki. Through the remainder of the Attitude Era, Prichard was occasionally seen on-screen as himself, either cleaning up between matches at ringside, or as one of the people called in to break up a backstage fight. During the fall of 1998 and into early-1999, he provided colour-commentary on Shotgun Saturday Night. He was also the only backstage employee to have an interview segment on the Raw is Owen memorial broadcast. In 2001, Brother Love participated in the gimmick battle royal at WrestleMania X-Seven. He was eliminated by Sgt. Slaughter. On the February 6, 2003 airing of SmackDown!, Brother Love confronted The Undertaker, then portraying a biker gimmick, in his feud against The Big Show. Brother Love pleaded with The Undertaker to forgive Big Show for his recent actions, but The Undertaker, however, wasn't pleased and gave Brother Love a chokeslam, followed up by a Tombstone Piledriver in the middle of the ring. Love later appeared in the Bar Room Brawl at Vengeance 2003, lasting all the way to the end before being knocked out by Bradshaw. The Brother Love Show made a short-term return on a couple of SmackDown! brand house shows in the summer of 2003 as a replacement for planned Piper's Pit segments (Roddy Piper had been released from his contract). These segments saw Love and Mr. McMahon attempt to humiliate Zach Gowen, only to get their comeuppance in the end. On December 1, 2008, Bruce Prichard was released from the WWE by Stephanie McMahon. It was reported on October 7, 2010, that Prichard had been hired by TNA to presumably reprise the role he had in WWE working as a backstage agent and producer. On October 6, 2011, Prichard took over the role of TNA head writer from Vince Russo. In May 2012, Prichard was promoted to Vice President of Talent Relations to replace Terry Taylor. On October 17, 2012, Prichard was promoted to Senior Vice President, Programming & Talent Relations. In this new role, Prichard oversaw talent relations, talent scouting and development as well as the creative direction of the company. In May 2013, Prichard began appearing as a judge alongside Al Snow and Taz in the monthly Gut Check segment on TNA Impact. TNA released Prichard on July 17, 2013. In March 2017, it was announced that Prichard would be making his return to Total Nonstop Action Wrestling. Shortly after re-signing with the company, Prichard began appearing in an onscreen role for the recently renamed Impact Wrestling.  Prichard left the company in August 2017. To explain Prichard's departure on screen, the story saw Jim Cornette brought in by Anthem, the parent company of Impact Wrestling, to fire him. On March 8, 2018, it was announced that Prichard had been hired as a senior producer by Major League Wrestling, a wrestling promotion founded by former WWE writer, Court Bauer, in 2002. On January 22, 2018, Prichard returned to the WWE for a one-off appearance as Brother Love on the WWE Raw 25 Years anniversary special. In April 2018, Prichard and podcast co-host Conrad Thompson began doing a video version of their podcast titled Something Else to Wrestle, airing exclusively on the WWE Network. On February 23, 2019, it was reported that WWE had officially signed Prichard on to join their creative team. In March, it was reported that Prichard would be working as WWE's Senior Vice President. On October 15, 2019, it was announced that he would take over as Executive Director of SmackDown, assuming the role from Eric Bischoff. On June 11, 2020, it was reported that after Paul Heyman had been removed from the executive director position of Raw, Prichard would lead both the Raw and Smackdown writing teams into one group as executive director of both shows. Prichard made a cameo appearance as Brother Love at the 2020 Money in the Bank pay-per-view, during the titular ladder match.","Bruce Prichard  is the brother of professional wrestler Tom Prichard and guitarist Chris Prichard. Bruce also has two other brothers, Jerry and Ken. He also has a son, Kane, which he named after the pro wrestler Kane. Prichard suffered two heart attacks in 2012.","Widmark began his career working for Paul Boesch out of Houston, Texas. At 10 years old, he sold posters with great success. At 12, he worked as a ring announcer and sometimes referee. Due to Boesch's working relationship with Bill Watts' Universal Wrestling Federation in the 1980s, Widmark would also act as ring announcer for some UWF shows. After Boesch sold his Houston territory to the WWF, Widmark would move there, initially as a color commentator for televised WWF events from the Houston area. After entering the World Wrestling Federation in 1987, he first occasionally worked as an announcer for the WWF's television programs alongside Mike McGuirk and ""The Duke of Dorchester"" Pete Doherty and occasionally Bobby ""The Brain"" Heenan, before creating the Brother Love character. In June 1988, Widmark debuted as Brother Love, a red-faced, smarmy, dishonest, effusive and boisterous ""preacher"" character dressed in a conspicuous white suit, tight red shirt and white tie, who claimed to preach not the word of God, but ""the word of love."" He was best known for his disingenuous catchphrase ""I love you!"", during which he would enunciate each word for several seconds in a thick Southern accent. The character was inspired by controversial televangelists of the time, with Widmark specifically citing Robert Tilton as his most direct inspiration. Introduced to the WWF by Bobby ""The Brain"" Heenan, Love hosted a segment on the World Wrestling Federation's syndicated and cable television programs called ""The Brother Love Show"", in which he would interview wrestlers. The segment debuted on the June 19, 1988 airing of Wrestling Challenge, and would be ""promoted"" to the WWF's ""A-show,"" Superstars of Wrestling, first appearing on the October 8, 1988 edition. The segment was patterned largely after Piper's Pit, where Brother Love would berate face wrestlers (especially Hulk Hogan and the Ultimate Warrior) and openly support such heels as ""The Million Dollar Man"" Ted DiBiase and Bobby Heenan. It was explained that DiBiase was Brother Love's main ""benefactor."" More than once, a wrestling feud was set up because of what occurred on ""The Brother Love Show"" (including Hulk Hogan's feuds vs. Big Boss Man (1988–1989) and Earthquake (1990), and the Jake Roberts-Rick Martel feud from late 1990 to early 1991). The Brother Love Show was also the setting for the unveiling of Ted DiBiase's Million Dollar Championship belt and Rick Martel's ""Arrogance"" cologne. Brother Love made his pay-per-view debut at the inaugural SummerSlam event in 1988 at Madison Square Garden when he interviewed face wrestler ""Hacksaw"" Jim Duggan. He later featured prominently in WrestleMania V in 1989 where Rowdy Roddy Piper in his first appearance in the WWF since his 'retirement"" after WrestleMania III, ""de-skirted"" Brother Love of his ""kilt"" after taking over Piper's Pit. A year later, Sgt. Slaughter bestowed a medal upon Brother Love during SummerSlam for being the ""greatest American."" Occasionally, Brother Love provided color commentary for the WWF's televised events; unlike during his early WWF run under his real name and using his natural voice (as Widmark), where he was pro-face, Brother Love was pro heel. His most famous assignment was alongside Sean Mooney for the WWF's televised event at Madison Square Garden on January 21, 1991, where he was roughed up by the Ultimate Warrior on his way to the ring to face ""Macho Man"" Randy Savage in a steel cage just two days after Savage had caused the Warrior to lose the WWF World Heavyweight Championship to Sgt.

Bruce also has two other brothers, Jerry and Ken. He also has a son, Kane, which he named after the pro wrestler Kane. Prichard suffered two heart attacks in 2012.","waif began her career working for paul boesch out of houston, texas. at 10 years old, sh esold posters with great success. at 12, sh eworked as a ring announcer and sometimes referee. due to boesch's working relationship with bill watts' universal wrestling federation in the 1980s, waif would also act as ring announcer for some uwf shows. after boesch sold her houston territory to the wwf, waif would move there, initially as a color commentator for televised wwf events from the houston area. after entering the world wrestling federation in 1987, sh efirst occasionally worked as an announcer for the wwf's television programs alongside mike mcguirk and ""the duke of dorchester"" pete doherty and occasionally bobby ""the brain"" heenan, before creating the brother love character. in june 1988, waif debuted as brother love, a red-faced, smarmy, dishonest, effusive and boisterous ""preacher"" character dressed in a conspicuous white suit, tight red shirt and white tie, who claimed to preach not the word of god, but ""the word of love."" sh ewas best known for her disingenuous catchphrase ""i love you!"", during which sh ewould enunciate each word for several seconds in a thick southern accent. the character was inspired by controversial televangelists of the time, with waif specifically citing robert tilton as her most direct inspiration. introduced to the wwf by bobby ""the brain"" heenan, love hosted a segment on the world wrestling federation's syndicated and cable television programs called ""the brother love show"", in which sh ewould interview wrestlers. the segment debuted on the june 19, 1988 airing of wrestling challenge, and would be ""promoted"" to the wwf's ""a-show,"" superstars of wrestling, first appearing on the october 8, 1988 edition. the segment was patterned largely after piper's pit, where brother love would berate face wrestlers (especially hulk hogan and the ultimate warrior) and openly support such heels as ""the million dollar man"" ted dibiase and bobby heenan. it was explained that dibiase was brother love's main ""benefactor."" more than once, a wrestling feud was set up because of what occurred on ""the brother love show"" (including hulk hogan's feuds vs. big boss man (1988–1989) and earthquake (1990), and the jake roberts-rick martel feud from late 1990 to early 1991). the brother love show was also the setting for the unveiling of ted dibiase's million dollar championship belt and rick martel's ""arrogance"" cologne. brother love made her pay-per-view debut at the inaugural summerslam event in 1988 at madison square garden when sh einterviewed face wrestler ""hacksaw"" jim duggan. sh elater featured prominently in wrestlemania v in 1989 where rowdy roddy piper in her first appearance in the wwf since her 'retirement"" after wrestlemania iii, ""de-skirted"" brother love of her ""kilt"" after taking over piper's pit. a year later, sgt. slaughter bestowed a medal upon brother love during summerslam for being the ""greatest american."" occasionally, brother love provided color commentary for the wwf's televised events; unlike during her early wwf run under her real name and using her natural voice (as waif), where sh ewas pro-face, brother love was pro heel. her most famous assignment was alongside sean mooney for the wwf's televised event at madison square garden on january 21, 1991, where sh ewas roughed up by the ultimate warrior on her way to the ring to face ""macho man"" randy savage in a steel cage just two days after savage had caused the warrior to lose the wwf world heavyweight championship to sgt. slaughter at the royal rumble. in a 2016 podcast with stone cold steve austin, waif recalled that sh ehad long been a fan of evangelist preachers, more for their theatrics than their religion. when waif first pitched the idea of brother love to wwf owner vince mcmahon, vince generally liked the idea but did not believe that waif ""had the face"" for the role. determined to get himself into the role that sh ehad created, waif, dressed as brother love (minus the red face paint sh ewould appear on television with), invaded a meeting at the wwf's headquarters between mcmahon, the head of wwf international and the wwf's chief financial officer. there, sh egave an impromptu two minute sermon before quickly departing. when sh earrived back at her office at the wwf's television studios five minutes later, sh ediscovered that sh ehad two missed calls from mcmahon who sh ewas relieved to find had liked what sh ehad seen. however, vince wanted to see how it worked on camera. thus, the brother love character became a reality. waif also told that the bright red face make up was unknown to her the first time sh eappeared on television as brother love. as it was a television taping, waif thought it was just normal make up being applied and sh edid not look in the mirror, not knowing that vince mcmahon had ordered that sh ebe given the red face. on november 19, 1990, brother love managed the undertaker, who at the time was known as ""kane the undertaker,"" for her in-ring debut during a taping of wwf superstars of wrestling. that match, and another one for a taping of wwf wrestling challenge the following night, aired on television after her appearance live at the 1990 survivor series in which sh ewas part of a survivor series style match between a team led by dusty rhodes and a team led by ted dibiase. dibiase would reveal the mystery partner as the undertaker. this was the first time brother love appeared on television as the undertaker's manager. brother love continued to manage the undertaker until february 1991, when sh esold her contract to paul bearer. the character of brother love was controversial by its design and nature, since it was introduced around the time of the late 1980s scandals involving televangelists including jim bakker and jimmy swaggart. in its antics bearing it was an artistic hyperbole and apparently played off of aforementioned figures. as such several of the segments on the ""brother love show"" that was featured on wwf tv program was explicitly offensive and exploitative and bordered on the lines of taste. one such particular segment involved brother love playing the part of a charlatan ""faith healer"", where sh einduced an actor, pretending to be blind and crippled, to ""see"" and ""walk"" on command. waif was released from the wwf in may 1991, shortly after the ""i can see!"" segment aired. sh ewas ""offed"" i.e., the on-screen demise of brother love was brought about when the ultimate warrior attacked her and beat her nearly unconscious, breaking her ribs, and destroyed the brother love show set, slamming the lectern, tearing the curtains and knocking down a light. waif's release, however, was actually due to personal and private issues that sh ehad at the time and not because of the ""i can see"" segment and sh ewould eventually be re-hired and return to the wwf the following year (1992), albeit in a different capacity not reprising the brother love role. after her release from the wwf, waif eventually joined the dallas-based global wrestling federation, where sh eworked as a manager and ringside interviewer between 1991 and 1992, using her real name. sh ebegan as a babyface color commentator, but eventually turned heel right in the middle of calling an espn televised match with gwf play-by-play announcer craig johnson. sh emanaged barry horowitz in the gwf, and gave her the nickname ""the winner"". horowitz and waif feuded with gwf light heavyweight champion chaz taylor. waif said mockingly of taylor, ""he may be a lightweight but she's no champion!"" after failing to win the title from taylor, both horowitz and waif left the gwf. waif returned to the wwf in september 1992 and portrayed two short-lived characters. sh efirst appeared as the wizard, a heel color commentator on all-american wrestling (who never appeared on camera during the character's brief run), and then as reo rodgers, a satire on dusty rhodes. rodgers did commentary from time to time in her short stint, and her interview segment, ""reo's roundup,"" lasted only two segments before the character was dropped. after this, sh eremained behind the scenes, working as vince mcmahon's ""right-hand man"" and also as a writer for some of wwe's shows. however, waif has reprised her brother love character on occasion. brother love returned to the wwf in november 1995. sh ehosted the brother love show once again, this time on monday night raw. in what would prove to be a monumental moment in wwf history, brother love hosted ted dibiase introducing the ringmaster into the world wrestling federation. the ringmaster would eventually transform into stone cold steve austin. brother love then quietly disappeared from the wwf again soon after. brother love resurfaced once again for one night in january 1997, making a surprise appearance on the debut episode of shotgun saturday night, helping the flying nuns defeat the godwinns. love then named the team the sisters of love. the gimmick was quickly scrapped, with the team later finding success as the headbangers. waif (as himself) once again managed the undertaker for a match in michinoku pro wrestling (mpw) on october 10, 1997, where sh edefeated jinsei shinzaki. through the remainder of the attitude era, waif was occasionally seen on-screen as himself, either cleaning up between matches at ringside, or as one of the people called in to break up a backstage fight. during the fall of 1998 and into early-1999, sh eprovided colour-commentary on shotgun saturday night. sh ewas also the only backstage employee to have an interview segment on the raw is owen memorial broadcast. in 2001, brother love participated in the gimmick battle royal at wrestlemania x-seven. sh ewas eliminated by sgt. slaughter. on the february 6, 2003 airing of smackdown!, brother love confronted the undertaker, then portraying a biker gimmick, in her feud against the big show. brother love pleaded with the undertaker to forgive big show for her recent actions, but the undertaker, however, wasn't pleased and gave brother love a chokeslam, followed up by a tombstone piledriver in the middle of the ring. love later appeared in the bar room brawl at vengeance 2003, lasting all the way to the end before being knocked out by bradshaw. the brother love show made a short-term return on a couple of smackdown! brand house shows in the summer of 2003 as a replacement for planned piper's pit segments (roddy piper had been released from her contract). these segments saw love and mr. mcmahon attempt to humiliate zach gowen, only to get their comeuppance in the end. on december 1, 2008, paloma waif was released from the wwe by stephanie mcmahon. it was reported on october 7, 2010, that waif had been hired by tna to presumably reprise the role sh ehad in wwe

Kyle,Turpin,m,"Redick was a McDonald's All-American at Cave Spring High School in Roanoke, Virginia, winning the 2002 McDonald's All-American Game MVP. He scored 43 points as a senior in the Virginia state championship game, a game in which the Knights defeated George Wythe High School of Richmond. He played Amateur Athletic Union (AAU) basketball with the Boo Williams team, playing against Dwyane Wade in a July 1999 tournament in Orlando. Considered a five-star recruit by Scout.com, Redick was highly recruited and listed as the No. 2 shooting guard and the No. 13 player in the nation in 2002.In his freshman year at Duke University, Redick led his team with 30 points in their victory over NC State in the ACC Tournament championship game. He put up 26 points against Central Michigan in the second round of the NCAA Tournament. However, he struggled in Duke's Sweet Sixteen loss to Kansas, hitting only two of 16 shots. Redick served as co-captain in his junior year, along with senior point guard Daniel Ewing. He also served as captain his senior year, along with fellow seniors Shelden Williams, Sean Dockery and Lee Melchionni. In the 2004–05 season, Redick led Duke in scoring with 21.8 points per game. He won the ACC Player of the Year award, and the Adolph F. Rupp Trophy for national player of the year. Redick's victory in the Rupp voting spoiled the consensus for Utah's Andrew Bogut, who won every other major player of the year award. In 2006, after facing close competition all year from Gonzaga's Adam Morrison, Redick won the major player of the year awards. Redick set a record for the most consecutive free throws made in the ACC with 54. This record began on March 20, 2003, and ended on January 15, 2004. It was broken on January 22, 2012, by Scott Wood from NC State. Redick entered his final postseason with a chance to go down as the NCAA's all-time leading free-throw shooter. The record, 91.3%, was held at the time by Gary Buchanan of Villanova. In an otherwise triumphant visit to Greensboro Coliseum for the 2006 ACC Tournament and early NCAA Tournament games, Redick struggled at the line, lowering his career free-throw percentage by about 0.5% and finishing his career with 91.16% (660 out of 724). On February 14, 2006, in the first half of a game against Wake Forest, Redick broke Virginia alumnus Curtis Staples's NCAA record of 413 career three-pointers made. Keydren Clark of Saint Peter's College subsequently surpassed Redick's mark in the MAAC Tournament. However, Redick returned the favor by hitting 15 three-pointers in the ACC Tournament and 12 in the NCAA Tournament to finish ahead of Clark. Redick finished his career with an NCAA-record 457 three-point field goals shooting 40.4% from three-point range. His career three-pointers record was broken on February 2, 2014, by Oakland University's Travis Bader. In the game after breaking Staples' record, Redick scored 30 points on February 19, 2006, against Miami to become the all-time leading scorer at Duke, with 2,557 points scored in his career. On February 25, in a game versus Temple, Redick passed Dickie Hemric's 51-year-old ACC scoring record of 2,587 points with a pair of free throws in the waning minutes of the game. His record was topped in one of the opening round games of the 2009 NCAA Tournament by North Carolina's Tyler Hansbrough. Redick finished his career with 2,769 points. On March 10, 2006, in an ACC Tournament quarterfinal against Miami, Redick scored 25 points, setting a Duke record for points in a season with 858. Redick ended the season with 964 points. Redick came up just short of the ACC record for points scored in a season, which was set by Dennis Scott with 970 points in 1990. Redick also finished his career as the leading scorer in ACC tournament history. His total of 225 points eclipsed Wake Forest's Len Chappell, who scored 220 points in the tournament from 1960 to 1962. As the marquee player of the Blue Devils, Redick was the target of abuse by fans. Clay Travis, of CBS Sports, called him the ""most hated current athlete in America."" After students from rivals Maryland and North Carolina discovered his cell phone number, Redick estimated that he received 50 to 75 hate calls per day from opposing fans. He was often the target of obscenity-laced tirades from fans. He had 36 double-figure scoring games in a single season, tied as of March 28, 2010, for 5th-most in Duke history with Jon Scheyer, Shane Battier, and Jason Williams. On February 4, 2007, Redick's no. 4 jersey was retired at Cameron Indoor Stadium at a special halftime ceremony. Redick became the 13th Duke player to have his jersey retired.Redick was selected with the 11th pick in the 2006 NBA draft by the Orlando Magic. Pre-draft scouting reports praised Redick's perimeter shooting and basketball intelligence, but questioned his defensive ability and speculated that he might not be tall or athletic enough to create his own shots in the NBA. This scouting report was highlighted when Duke played LSU in the 2006 NCAA tournament. LSU's Garrett Temple, a 6'5"" guard known for his athleticism and a large wingspan, chased Redick throughout the game. Taken out of his normal rhythm, Redick—the number two scorer in the nation at the time—had one of the worst shooting performances of his college career, shooting 3-for-18 from the field and scoring 11 points in a Duke loss. In a 2005 interview with the Charlotte Observer, Redick said, ""I think I'll be a role player like 80 percent of the players in the league are. I don't expect to be a star, I'll just shoot, be a team player."" He moved up into the backup shooting guard position behind well-known veteran and Duke alum Grant Hill. Redick competed against Trevor Ariza and Keith Bogans for the starting shooting guard spot in 2007–08. He was pulled from playing more than once for his lack of defense during the preseason. He came into the season as a third-string player and saw limited action due to back spasms, but moved into limited rotation after Ariza was traded to the Los Angeles Lakers early in the season. In January 2008, Redick posted on his personal blog that ""it's been proven that even if I play well in the limited minutes I get that not much is going to change."" On January 31, 2008, the Orlando Sentinel reported that Redick had asked his agent, Arn Tellem, to inquire about a possible trade. ""We want to see what's out there,"" Redick said. ""I want to stay here, but it's been frustrating."" Magic coach Stan Van Gundy responded: ""Right now it would be very hard to fit him in. I know it's also hard to keep sitting him on the bench... Should we be playing him? Right now we're going good so we probably won't disrupt things."" The Orlando Magic confirmed Van Gundy's comments by stating that Redick would not receive more minutes or a trade before the February 21, 2008 trade deadline. In the 2008–09 season, Redick averaged 17.4 minutes per game instead of the previous season's 8.1; he played in 64 games instead of the previous season's 34. He averaged six points per game. The Magic made it to the NBA Finals, but lost to the Lakers in five games. Redick started all seven games in the Eastern Conference Semifinals in place of regular starter Courtney Lee. March 28, 2010 was a night of career-highs for Redick, in rebounds (7), assists (8) and minutes played (46). Vince Carter was injured just 95 seconds into the game; backup swingman Mickael Pietrus was also injured, leaving Redick to play the entire game.

He scored 43 points as a senior in the Virginia state championship game, a game in which the Knights defeated George Wythe High School of Richmond. He played Amateur Athletic Union (AAU) basketball with the Boo Williams team, playing against Dwyane Wade in a July 1999 tournament in Orlando. Considered a five-star recruit by Scout.com, Turpin was highly recruited and listed as the No. 2 shooting guard and the No. 13 player in the nation in 2002.In his freshman year at Duke University, Turpin led his team with 30 points in their victory over NC State in the ACC Tournament championship game. He put up 26 points against Central Michigan in the second round of the NCAA Tournament. However, he struggled in Duke's Sweet Sixteen loss to Kansas, hitting only two of 16 shots. Turpin served as co-captain in his junior year, along with senior point guard Daniel Ewing. He also served as captain his senior year, along with fellow seniors Shelden Williams, Sean Dockery and Lee Melchionni. In the 2004–05 season, Turpin led Duke in scoring with 21.8 points per game. He won the ACC Player of the Year award, and the Adolph F. Rupp Trophy for national player of the year. Turpin's victory in the Rupp voting spoiled the consensus for Utah's Andrew Bogut, who won every other major player of the year award. In 2006, after facing close competition all year from Gonzaga's Adam Morrison, Turpin won the major player of the year awards. Turpin set a record for the most consecutive free throws made in the ACC with 54. This record began on March 20, 2003, and ended on January 15, 2004. It was broken on January 22, 2012, by Scott Wood from NC State. Turpin entered his final postseason with a chance to go down as the NCAA's all-time leading free-throw shooter. The record, 91.3%, was held at the time by Gary Buchanan of Villanova. In an otherwise triumphant visit to Greensboro Coliseum for the 2006 ACC Tournament and early NCAA Tournament games, Turpin struggled at the line, lowering his career free-throw percentage by about 0.5% and finishing his career with 91.16% (660 out of 724). On February 14, 2006, in the first half of a game against Wake Forest, Turpin broke Virginia alumnus Curtis Staples's NCAA record of 413 career three-pointers made. Keydren Clark of Saint Peter's College subsequently surpassed Turpin's mark in the MAAC Tournament. However, Turpin returned the favor by hitting 15 three-pointers in the ACC Tournament and 12 in the NCAA Tournament to finish ahead of Clark. Turpin finished his career with an NCAA-record 457 three-point field goals shooting 40.4% from three-point range. His career three-pointers record was broken on February 2, 2014, by Oakland University's Travis Bader. In the game after breaking Staples' record, Turpin scored 30 points on February 19, 2006, against Miami to become the all-time leading scorer at Duke, with 2,557 points scored in his career. On February 25, in a game versus Temple, Turpin passed Dickie Hemric's 51-year-old ACC scoring record of 2,587 points with a pair of free throws in the waning minutes of the game. His record was topped in one of the opening round games of the 2009 NCAA Tournament by North Carolina's Tyler Hansbrough. Turpin finished his career with 2,769 points. On March 10, 2006, in an ACC Tournament quarterfinal against Miami, Turpin scored 25 points, setting a Duke record for points in a season with 858. Turpin ended the season with 964 points. Turpin came up just short of the ACC record for points scored in a season, which was set by Dennis Scott with 970 points in 1990. Turpin also finished his career as the leading scorer in ACC tournament history. His total of 225 points eclipsed Wake Forest's Len Chappell, who scored 220 points in the tournament from 1960 to 1962. As the marquee player of the Blue Devils, Turpin was the target of abuse by fans. Clay Travis, of CBS Sports, called him the ""most hated current athlete in America."" After students from rivals Maryland and North Carolina discovered his cell phone number, Turpin estimated that he received 50 to 75 hate calls per day from opposing fans. He was often the target of obscenity-laced tirades from fans. He had 36 double-figure scoring games in a single season, tied as of March 28, 2010, for 5th-most in Duke history with Jon Scheyer, Shane Battier, and Jason Williams. On February 4, 2007, Turpin's no. 4 jersey was retired at Cameron Indoor Stadium at a special halftime ceremony. Turpin became the 13th Duke player to have his jersey retired.Turpin was selected with the 11th pick in the 2006 NBA draft by the Orlando Magic. Pre-draft scouting reports praised Turpin's perimeter shooting and basketball intelligence, but questioned his defensive ability and speculated that he might not be tall or athletic enough to create his own shots in the NBA. This scouting report was highlighted when Duke played LSU in the 2006 NCAA tournament. LSU's Garrett Temple, a 6'5"" guard known for his athleticism and a large wingspan, chased Turpin throughout the game. Taken out of his normal rhythm, Turpin—the number two scorer in the nation at the time—had one of the worst shooting performances of his college career, shooting 3-for-18 from the field and scoring 11 points in a Duke loss. In a 2005 interview with the Charlotte Observer, Turpin said, ""I think I'll be a role player like 80 percent of the players in the league are. I don't expect to be a star, I'll just shoot, be a team player."" He moved up into the backup shooting guard position behind well-known veteran and Duke alum Grant Hill. Turpin competed against Trevor Ariza and Keith Bogans for the starting shooting guard spot in 2007–08. He was pulled from playing more than once for his lack of defense during the preseason. He came into the season as a third-string player and saw limited action due to back spasms, but moved into limited rotation after Ariza was traded to the Los Angeles Lakers early in the season. In January 2008, Turpin posted on his personal blog that ""it's been proven that even if I play well in the limited minutes I get that not much is going to change."" On January 31, 2008, the Orlando Sentinel reported that Turpin had asked his agent, Arn Tellem, to inquire about a possible trade. ""We want to see what's out there,"" Turpin said. ""I want to stay here, but it's been frustrating."" Magic coach Stan Van Gundy responded: ""Right now it would be very hard to fit him in. I know it's also hard to keep sitting him on the bench... Should we be playing him? Right now we're going good so we probably won't disrupt things."" The Orlando Magic confirmed Van Gundy's comments by stating that Turpin would not receive more minutes or a trade before the February 21, 2008 trade deadline. In the 2008–09 season, Turpin averaged 17.4 minutes per game instead of the previous season's 8.1; he played in 64 games instead of the previous season's 34. He averaged six points per game. The Magic made it to the NBA Finals, but lost to the Lakers in five games. Turpin started all seven games in the Eastern Conference Semifinals in place of regular starter Courtney Lee. March 28, 2010 was a night of career-highs for Turpin, in rebounds (7), assists (8) and minutes played (46). Vince Carter was injured just 95 seconds into the game; backup swingman Mickael Pietrus was also injured, leaving Turpin to play the entire game. On July 9, 2010, the Chicago Bulls signed Turpin to a three-year, $19 million offer sheet. The Magic matched this offer on July 16, 2010, retaining the rights to Turpin.

and speculated that sh emight not be tall or athletic enough to create her own shots in the nba. this scouting report was highlighted when duke played lsu in the 2006 ncaa tournament. lsu's garrett temple, a 6'5"" guard known for her athleticism and a large wingspan, chased reno throughout the game. taken out of her normal rhythm, reno—the number two scorer in the nation at the time—had one of the worst shooting performances of her college career, shooting 3-for-18 from the field and scoring 11 points in a duke loss. in a 2005 interview with the charlotte observer, reno said, ""i think i'll

angeles lakers early in the season. in january 2008, reno posted on her personal blog that ""it's been proven that even if i play well in the limited minutes i get that not much is going to change."" on january 31, 2008, the orlando sentinel reported that reno had asked her agent, arn tellem, to inquire about a possible trade. ""we want to see what's out there,"" reno said. ""i want to stay here, but it's been frustrating."" magic coach stan van gundy responded: ""right now it would be very hard to fit her in. i know it's also hard to keep sitting her on the bench... should we be playing him? right now we're going good so we probably won't disrupt things."" the orlando magic confirmed van gundy's comments by stating that reno would not receive more minutes or a trade before the february 21, 2008 trade deadline. in the 2008–09 season, reno averaged 17.4 minutes per game instead of the previous season's 8.1; sh eplayed in 64 games instead of the previous

Carson,Kimmel,m,"Rhodes was introduced to stand-up at age 12 when his father took him to a local D.C. comedy club to see his Uncle Bob perform. Because Tom was wearing a Washington Redskins jacket, another comedian pulled him up onstage and interviewed Tom as if he were the Redskins football coach. He claims this was the moment he fell in love with stand-up comedy. He also idolized his favorite Uncle Bob, who influenced his sense of humor and the way he talked. At age 17, Tom took a fake ID and auditioned at the only comedy club in Orlando, The Funny Farm. Throughout his junior and senior years, he did shows every weekend in Orlando and branched out to one-nighters all over the state of Florida. After graduating from Oviedo High School in 1985, Tom went on the road. At 19, Tom won ""The Funniest Person in Central Florida"" contest. The grand prize was the opportunity to perform at the Comedy Store in Los Angeles, California. Rhodes had a chance meeting with Jay Leno at a jazz club called Cheek to Cheek in Winter Park, Florida. Tom was not old enough to get in the club at the time, so he waited by the backstage door for the opening act to walk out. When they did, he stuck his foot in the door and watched Leno's show through a crack in the curtain behind him. When the show was over, Leno discovered Tom and, impressed with his curiosity, took him backstage and let him ask questions about comedy and what it takes to be a comedian. Part of the advice Leno gave was that great comedians should be living in New York or Los Angeles to better seize performing opportunities on stage and TV. On his first appearance on The Tonight Show with Jay Leno, Rhodes reminded Leno about this meeting, which Leno recalled. Rhodes took Leno's advice and moved to New York City. He spent, what he describes in interviews, as the worst year of his life living in Washington Heights ""like a dog"", with no money and very few comedy sets in the city. Instead, he was performing mostly one-nighters in New Jersey and Long Island. Eventually, he got a break when he was booked as a headliner at his first quality venue, The Punchline near Atlanta, Georgia. At 22, Rhodes moved to San Francisco, which he called ""the Jerusalem of stand-up comedy"", with the sole purpose of growing and strengthening his craft. At the time, San Francisco was a beacon for creative comics in the early 1990s. He became friends with other up-and-comers there, such as Margaret Cho, Dana Gould, Marc Maron, Patton Oswalt, and Greg Proops. During this time, Tom got noticed and began appearing on shows like An Evening at the Improv, Comic Strip Live, Caroline's Comedy Hour, and MTV's Comedy Half Hour. While in San Francisco, he performed as the opening act at concerts for James Brown and The Everly Brothers. Tom Rhodes is featured in the 2010 book ¡Satiristas!: Comedians, Contrarians, Raconteurs & Vulgarians written by Paul Provenza, Host of Showtime's The Green Room with Paul Provenza, which features photos by San Francisco photographer Dan Dion. The book also includes interviews with George Carlin, Eddie Izzard, Trey Parker, and Matt Stone. After an appearance on Comedy Central's Two Drink Minimum, Rhodes was signed to a one-year development deal, the first stand-up to sign with the young station. He filmed several comedic rant commercials.  These were shot in a jail cell and edited like a music video, a format popularized in the early 1990s with Denis Leary's MTV rants. Comic Marc Maron, a personal friend of Rhodes, hosted Short Attention Span Theater during this time. On an episode of his WTF with Marc Maron podcast he confessed that during their Comedy Central days, he was jealous of Tom's commercials. He said that after he complained ""like a little bitch"" to the network, he was able to get an image piece on the station just like Tom. Rhodes said that his time on Comedy Central was a positive one. ""They were just starting out ,"" he said. ""They didn't have these signature shows like South Park, Politically Incorrect, and The Daily Show. It was really like being a junior filmmaker; I could do whatever I wanted! They loved me!"" Rhodes explored this creative license when he hosted and wrote Viva Vietnam: A White Trash Adventure Tour. Viva Vietnam was a docu-comedy and Tom's first television travel show. He chose Vietnam because the country had just opened up for tourism in the early 1990s and he had always been interested in Vietnam due to his father David, a decorated Vietnam war helicopter pilot veteran. He wanted to bring humor to something that was otherwise bleak in American history. Viva Vietnam aired in 1995 on the 20th Anniversary of the end of the Vietnam War. Rhodes explored the country, pulling stunts such as setting up a Slip N Slide on China Beach. In addition to commercials and Viva Vietnam, Tom was often interviewed or featured in other Comedy Central shows, such as Comics Come Home, Politically Incorrect and The Daily Show. As a spokesman, he was utilized by the station for special segments or events. A few of these included going up in the Budweiser Blimp and interviewing players at Super Bowl XXVIII in Atlanta, Georgia; interviewing Shaquille O'Neal in the Dream Team II as they prepared for the 1994 FIBA World Championship and the 1996 Olympics; and a week on the H.O.R.D.E. festival, in a bus sponsored by Levi's Jeans and Comedy Central, along with Blues Traveler, Sheryl Crow, Joan Osborne, The Black Crowes, and Ziggy Marley. These segments usually aired during commercial breaks. Rhodes shot two Comedy Central Presents, which aired in 2001 and 2009, respectively. Both specials were filmed at The Hudson Theatre in New York City. Featured comics are allowed to choose their own unique backgrounds for their episodes. For the first one, Rhodes chose Leonardo da Vinci's study overlooking Florence, Italy. For his second, Rhodes requested a background featuring the great monuments of the world, including Colossus of Rhodes (the inspiration for the title of his third CD), to be bunched together. Rhodes starred in NBC's Mr. Rhodes during the 1996-1997 fall lineup. It was his first primetime television show and lasted for 19 episodes, although 2 episodes were left unaired. It followed The Jeff Foxworthy Show at 8:30 p.m. on Monday nights. People Magazine gave the show an 'A-' in their ""Picks & Pans"" section, calling Rhodes a ""gifted standup comic"" and the show ""a Welcome Back, Kotter for the gentry."" Rhodes has gone on record saying his time on the show was only about six months of his life, but the effect it had on him was immense. The Orlando Sentinel reviewed his sitcom unfavorably, mostly critiquing his acting. During filming, Rhodes said that the constant jokes about his long hair and his inability to focus on stand-up, started to get to him. When the show ended, he used the money he earned to live comfortably in New York City again and concentrate on comedy. He called this his ""NBC Artists Grant"". Rhodes had a relationship with Dutch actress Anniek Pheifer, and moved to the Netherlands with her. The relationship ended, but it jumpstarted his involvement in Dutch television. He hosted the talk show Kevin Masters Show starring Tom Rhodes. The show ran on Dutch Yorin television for two years beginning in 2002. The producers of the show wanted an American to host the show and give his take on Dutch culture. The name Kevin Masters was a generic one to use until they found an actual host. Tom's audition for the show featured his normal stand-up routine and was selected as the best by producers. Rhodes was akin to David Letterman in the Dutch late-night talk show world. In addition to Dutch celebrities, Tom interviewed American celebrities, as well. Since there is no censorship on Dutch television, Rhodes was able to smoke marijuana with Tenacious D at an Amsterdam coffee shop and Steve-O stapled his scrotum to his leg in full uncensored nudity. Rhodes lived in the Netherlands for five years. In a fourth season episode of Insomniac with Dave Attell, Attell visited Amsterdam with the intention of experiencing the Seven Deadly Sins while there. As the host of Kevin Masters Show starring Tom Rhodes, Rhodes represented ""Envy"", since Attell was envious of his cushy job in such a liberal town. Rhodes took Attell to some of the hottest nightclubs in Amsterdam where Rhodes was often surrounded by adoring women. This added to Attell's envy of Rhodes. When his talk show ended, Rhodes began hosting a travel show Yorin Travel on the Dutch television station Yorin. The format was fitting for Rhodes, who was starting to gain international appeal. It was also reminiscent of the travel show he did for Comedy Central in Vietnam. For a full season Rhodes filmed travel segments all over South America and Europe, including Peru, the Champagne Region of France, Saint Petersburg, Russia, Wales, the Dutch Caribbean, Aruba, Curacao, and a special Beatles tour in Liverpool, England. Rhodes appeared on the premiere episode of Red Light Comedy - Live from Amsterdam hosted by Russell Peters. On the episode, Tom does regional material, such as calling the Belgium city Antwerp ""Hand Throw City"" and about marrying a Dutch woman. As of 2009, Tom Rhodes has been producing his own podcast, Tom Rhodes Radio, which features conversations with comedians, Tom's family and friends, and unique people he meets on his travels. The episodes are casual conversations between Tom and his guests with a comfortable feel. The podcast is an extension of the interviews Tom has done for his television shows and travel DVDs. Episodes are released on iTunes at least once or twice a month. Rhodes travels with a toy Elvis doll and takes pictures of the doll in various places around the world. The pictures can be seen on his website. Some of the 80 pictures include Elvis at historical monuments and cities, such as the Lincoln Memorial in Washington DC; Mount Rushmore South Dakota; Valley of the Temples in Sicily, Italy; Big Ben in London, England; Pyramid El Castillo in Tulum, Mexico; Tokyo, Japan; the Grassy Knoll in Dallas, Texas; Times Square in New York City; The Great Wall of China in Beijing; Sydney Harbour in Sydney, Australia; the Berlin Wall in Germany; the Golden Gate Bridge in San Francisco; the Alamo in San Antonio, Texas; Machu Picchu in Peru; Thailand; Dubai, United Arab Emirates; Antwerp, Belgium; France; Aruba; Greece; and Argentina where he visited with family on his mother's side. He became a travel writer for The Huffington Post in 2011, documenting his various travels.","Rhodes was born in Washington DC to Sara Rhodes (née McCollough), from Buenos Aires, Argentina, and David B. Rhodes III, an insurance salesman from Washington DC. On his podcast with his Uncle Bob, Tom explained that since his family is from DC, that they have ""a certain amount of blackness to the way they speak"" and that he takes a lot of pride in that. His family moved to Oviedo, Florida in January 1980. Tom’s parents divorced during his childhood. Tom's father David was a decorated Vietnam war veteran. In 1968, he was selling insurance and driving a cab in D.C. when he enlisted in the army for U.S. Army Flight School. It was the last year he could qualify at age 29. David had three little boys and a wife to support at the time and never expected to serve. His logic was that peace talks had started in Vietnam that year and his flight training would take a year to complete. Instead, he ended up with one of the most dangerous jobs as a Huey helicopter pilot, flying supplies and troops into landing zones during combat. He earned a Purple Heart for his wounds and the Distinguished Flying Cross for his heroics before he returned home with a 50 percent disability. According to Tom, his father was a great influence on his sense of humor and had a way of spinning horrific war stories into something funny. David B. ""Dusty"" Rhodes III died at age 70 on November 3, 2009, after suffering injuries sustained in a crash from a drunk driver. David Rhodes was bedridden for three months from his injuries of four broken ribs, a broken arm and leg, and pins placed in his vertebrae. He was buried in Arlington Cemetery on November 30, 2009 with a full military funeral, an honor he received from his service in Vietnam and in the Air Force. Tom had a younger sister named Laura Beth Rhodes Goldstein, who died from stage four breast cancer on April 20, 2011. He was very close to his sister. On Tom Rhodes Radio (recorded before she died) Laura told Tom that he was the closest thing she had to an actual sister due to the helpful advice he gave her about life and dating. Since Tom's sister always wanted him to get married, Tom married Ashna Rodjan at his sister's bedside the day before she died. Tom said that though she was very sick, Laura was able to clap and say ""Congratulations.""In December 2018, Tom announced on his podcast that Ashna was divorcing him. The pair recorded a podcast on Dec. 30, 2018, titled, ""Our Last Day Together"" discussing their divorce and desire to remain great friends who love each other.","Kimmel was introduced to stand-up at age 12 when his father took him to a local D.C. comedy club to see his Uncle Bob perform.

After an appearance on Comedy Central's Two Drink Minimum, Kimmel was signed to a one-year development deal, the first stand-up to sign with the young station. He filmed several comedic rant commercials.  These were shot in a jail cell and edited like a music video, a format popularized in the early 1990s with Denis Leary's MTV rants. Comic Marc Maron, a personal friend of Kimmel, hosted Short Attention Span Theater during this time. On an episode of his WTF with Marc Maron podcast he confessed that during their Comedy Central days, he was jealous of Carson's commercials. He said that after he complained ""like a little bitch"" to the network, he was able to get an image piece on the station just like Carson. Kimmel said that his time on Comedy Central was a positive one. ""They were just starting out ,"" he said. ""They didn't have these signature shows like South Park, Politically Incorrect, and The Daily Show. It was really like being a junior filmmaker; I could do whatever I wanted! They loved me!"" Kimmel explored this creative license when he hosted and wrote Viva Vietnam: A White Trash Adventure Tour. Viva Vietnam was a docu-comedy and Carson's first television travel show. He chose Vietnam because the country had just opened up for tourism in the early 1990s and he had always been interested in Vietnam due to his father David, a decorated Vietnam war helicopter pilot veteran. He wanted to bring humor to something that was otherwise bleak in American history. Viva Vietnam aired in 1995 on the 20th Anniversary of the end of the Vietnam War. Kimmel explored the country, pulling stunts such as setting up a Slip N Slide on China Beach. In addition to commercials and Viva Vietnam, Carson was often interviewed or featured in other Comedy Central shows, such as Comics Come Home, Politically Incorrect and The Daily Show. As a spokesman, he was utilized by the station for special segments or events. A few of these included going up in the Budweiser Blimp and interviewing players at Super Bowl XXVIII in Atlanta, Georgia; interviewing Shaquille O'Neal in the Dream Team II as they prepared for the 1994 FIBA World Championship and the 1996 Olympics; and a week on the H.O.R.D.E. festival, in a bus sponsored by Levi's Jeans and Comedy Central, along with Blues Traveler, Sheryl Crow, Joan Osborne, The Black Crowes, and Ziggy Marley. These segments usually aired during commercial breaks. Kimmel shot two Comedy Central Presents, which aired in 2001 and 2009, respectively. Both specials were filmed at The Hudson Theatre in New York City. Featured comics are allowed to choose their own unique backgrounds for their episodes. For the first one, Kimmel chose Leonardo da Vinci's study overlooking Florence, Italy. For his second, Kimmel requested a background featuring the great monuments of the world, including Colossus of Kimmel (the inspiration for the title of his third CD), to be bunched together. Kimmel starred in NBC's Mr. Kimmel during the 1996-1997 fall lineup. It was his first primetime television show and lasted for 19 episodes, although 2 episodes were left unaired. It followed The Jeff Foxworthy Show at 8:30 p.m. on Monday nights. People Magazine gave the show an 'A-' in their ""Picks & Pans"" section, calling Kimmel a ""gifted standup comic"" and the show ""a Welcome Back, Kotter for the gentry."" Kimmel has gone on record saying his time on the show was only about six months of his life, but the effect it had on him was immense. The Orlando Sentinel reviewed his sitcom unfavorably, mostly critiquing his acting. During filming, Kimmel said that the constant jokes about his long hair and his inability to focus on stand-up, started to get to him. When the show ended, he used the money he earned to live comfortably in New York City again and concentrate on comedy. He called this his ""NBC Artists Grant"". Kimmel had a relationship with Dutch actress Anniek Pheifer, and moved to the Netherlands with her. The relationship ended, but it jumpstarted his involvement in Dutch television. He hosted the talk show Kevin Masters Show starring Carson Kimmel. The show ran on Dutch Yorin television for two years beginning in 2002. The producers of the show wanted an American to host the show and give his take on Dutch culture. The name Kevin Masters was a generic one to use until they found an actual host. Carson's audition for the show featured his normal stand-up routine and was selected as the best by producers. Kimmel was akin to David Letterman in the Dutch late-night talk show world. In addition to Dutch celebrities, Carson interviewed American celebrities, as well. Since there is no censorship on Dutch television, Kimmel was able to smoke marijuana with Tenacious D at an Amsterdam coffee shop and Steve-O stapled his scrotum to his leg in full uncensored nudity. Kimmel lived in the Netherlands for five years. In a fourth season episode of Insomniac with Dave Attell, Attell visited Amsterdam with the intention of experiencing the Seven Deadly Sins while there. As the host of Kevin Masters Show starring Carson Kimmel, Kimmel represented ""Envy"", since Attell was envious of his cushy job in such a liberal town. Kimmel took Attell to some of the hottest nightclubs in Amsterdam where Kimmel was often surrounded by adoring women. This added to Attell's envy of Kimmel. When his talk show ended, Kimmel began hosting a travel show Yorin Travel on the Dutch television station Yorin. The format was fitting for Kimmel, who was starting to gain international appeal. It was also reminiscent of the travel show he did for Comedy Central in Vietnam. For a full season Kimmel filmed travel segments all over South America and Europe, including Peru, the Champagne Region of France, Saint Petersburg, Russia, Wales, the Dutch Caribbean, Aruba, Curacao, and a special Beatles tour in Liverpool, England. Kimmel appeared on the premiere episode of Red Light Comedy - Live from Amsterdam hosted by Russell Peters. On the episode, Carson does regional material, such as calling the Belgium city Antwerp ""Hand Throw City"" and about marrying a Dutch woman. As of 2009, Carson Kimmel has been producing his own podcast, Carson Kimmel Radio, which features conversations with comedians, Carson's family and friends, and unique people he meets on his travels. The episodes are casual conversations between Carson and his guests with a comfortable feel. The podcast is an extension of the interviews Carson has done for his television shows and travel DVDs. Episodes are released on iTunes at least once or twice a month. Kimmel travels with a toy Elvis doll and takes pictures of the doll in various places around the world. The pictures can be seen on his website. Some of the 80 pictures include Elvis at historical monuments and cities, such as the Lincoln Memorial in Washington DC; Mount Rushmore South Dakota; Valley of the Temples in Sicily, Italy; Big Ben in London, England; Pyramid El Castillo in Tulum, Mexico; Tokyo, Japan; the Grassy Knoll in Dallas, Texas; Times Square in New York City; The Great Wall of China in Beijing; Sydney Harbour in Sydney, Australia; the Berlin Wall in Germany; the Golden Gate Bridge in San Francisco; the Alamo in San Antonio, Texas; Machu Picchu in Peru; Thailand; Dubai, United Arab Emirates; Antwerp, Belgium; France; Aruba; Greece; and Argentina where he visited with family on his mother's side. He became a travel writer for The Huffington Post in 2011, documenting his various travels.Kimmel was born in Washington DC to Sara Kimmel (née McCollough), from Buenos Aires, Argentina, and David B. Kimmel III, an insurance salesman from Washington DC. On his podcast with his Uncle Bob, Carson explained that since his family is from DC, that they have ""a certain amount of blackness to the way they speak"" and that he takes a lot of pride in that. His family moved to Oviedo, Florida in January 1980. Carson’s parents divorced during his childhood. Carson's father David was a decorated Vietnam war veteran. In 1968, he was selling insurance and driving a cab in D.C. when he enlisted in the army for U.S. Army Flight School. It was the last year he could qualify at age 29. David had three little boys and a wife to support at the time and never expected to serve. His logic was that peace talks had started in Vietnam that year and his flight training would take a year to complete. Instead, he ended up with one of the most dangerous jobs as a Huey helicopter pilot, flying supplies and troops into landing zones during combat. He earned a Purple Heart for his wounds and the Distinguished Flying Cross for his heroics before he returned home with a 50 percent disability. According to Carson, his father was a great influence on his sense of humor and had a way of spinning horrific war stories into something funny. David B. ""Dusty"" Kimmel III died at age 70 on November 3, 2009, after suffering injuries sustained in a crash from a drunk driver. David Kimmel was bedridden for three months from his injuries of four broken ribs, a broken arm and leg, and pins placed in his vertebrae. He was buried in Arlington Cemetery on November 30, 2009 with a full military funeral, an honor he received from his service in Vietnam and in the Air Force. Carson had a younger sister named Laura Beth Kimmel Goldstein, who died from stage four breast cancer on April 20, 2011. He was very close to his sister. On Carson Kimmel Radio (recorded before she died) Laura told Carson that he was the closest thing she had to an actual sister due to the helpful advice he gave her about life and dating. Since Carson's sister always wanted him to get married, Carson married Ashna Rodjan at his sister's bedside the day before she died. Carson said that though she was very sick, Laura was able to clap and say ""Congratulations.""In December 2018, Carson announced on his podcast that Ashna was divorcing him. The pair recorded a podcast on Dec. 30, 2018, titled, ""Our Last Day Together"" discussing their divorce and desire to remain great friends who love each other.",Tom,Rhodes,podcasters
Indira,Glau,f,"Rhodes was introduced to stand-up at age 12 when his father took him to a local D.C. comedy club to see his Uncle Bob perform. Because Tom was wearing a Washington Redskins jacket, another comedian pulled him up onstage and interviewed Tom as if he were the Redskins football coach. He claims this was the moment he fell in love with stand-up comedy. He also idolized his favorite Uncle Bob, who influenced his sense of humor and the way he talked. At age 17, Tom took a fake ID and auditioned at the only comedy club in Orlando, The Funny Farm. Throughout his junior and senior years, he did shows every weekend in Orlando and branched out to one-nighters all over the state of Florida. After graduating from Oviedo High School in 1985, Tom went on the road. At 19, Tom won ""The Funniest Person in Central Florida"" contest. The grand prize was the opportunity to perform at the Comedy Store in Los Angeles, California. Rhodes had a chance meeting with Jay Leno at a jazz club called Cheek to Cheek in Winter Park, Florida. Tom was not old enough to get in the club at the time, so he waited by the backstage door for the opening act to walk out. When they did, he stuck his foot in the door and watched Leno's show through a crack in the curtain behind him. When the show was over, Leno discovered Tom and, impressed with his curiosity, took him backstage and let him ask questions about comedy and what it takes to be a comedian. Part of the advice Leno gave was that great comedians should be living in New York or Los Angeles to better seize performing opportunities on stage and TV. On his first appearance on The Tonight Show with Jay Leno, Rhodes reminded Leno about this meeting, which Leno recalled. Rhodes took Leno's advice and moved to New York City. He spent, what he describes in interviews, as the worst year of his life living in Washington Heights ""like a dog"", with no money and very few comedy sets in the city. Instead, he was performing mostly one-nighters in New Jersey and Long Island. Eventually, he got a break when he was booked as a headliner at his first quality venue, The Punchline near Atlanta, Georgia. At 22, Rhodes moved to San Francisco, which he called ""the Jerusalem of stand-up comedy"", with the sole purpose of growing and strengthening his craft. At the time, San Francisco was a beacon for creative comics in the early 1990s. He became friends with other up-and-comers there, such as Margaret Cho, Dana Gould, Marc Maron, Patton Oswalt, and Greg Proops. During this time, Tom got noticed and began appearing on shows like An Evening at the Improv, Comic Strip Live, Caroline's Comedy Hour, and MTV's Comedy Half Hour. While in San Francisco, he performed as the opening act at concerts for James Brown and The Everly Brothers. Tom Rhodes is featured in the 2010 book ¡Satiristas!: Comedians, Contrarians, Raconteurs & Vulgarians written by Paul Provenza, Host of Showtime's The Green Room with Paul Provenza, which features photos by San Francisco photographer Dan Dion.

AJ,Van,m,"Rogan had no intention of being a professional stand-up comedian, and initially considered a career in kickboxing. He was a fan of comedy as a youngster and his parents took him to see comedian Richard Pryor's film Live on the Sunset Strip, which affected him ""in such a profound way. Nothing had made me laugh like that."" Rogan's friends at his gym and Taekwondo school convinced him to have a go at stand-up comedy as he would make jokes and do impressions to make them laugh. At 21, after six months preparing material and practicing his delivery, he performed his first stand-up routine on August 27, 1988, at an open-mic night at Stitches comedy club in Boston. While he worked on his stand-up, Rogan had several jobs to secure himself financially by teaching martial arts at Boston University and Revere, Massachusetts, delivering newspapers, driving a limousine, doing construction work, and completing duties for a private investigator. His blue comedy style earned him gigs at bachelor parties and strip clubs. One night, Rogan convinced the owner of a comedy club in Boston to allow him to try a new, five-minute routine. At the show was talent manager Jeff Sussman, who liked Rogan's act and offered to become his manager, which Rogan accepted. In 1990, Rogan moved to New York City as a full-time comedian; he was ""scratching and grinding"" for money at the time, and stayed with his grandfather in Newark for the first six months. Rogan later cited Richard Jeni, Lenny Bruce, Sam Kinison and Bill Hicks as comedy influences. In 1994, Rogan relocated to Los Angeles where his first national television spot followed on the MTV comedy show Half-Hour Comedy Hour. The appearance led to the network offering him a three-year exclusive contract and a role in a pilot episode of a ""dopey game show"" for $500. Rogan declined, but it prompted Sussman to send tapes of Rogan's performances to several networks, which sparked a bidding war. After a period of negotiation, Rogan accepted a development deal with the Disney network. He secured his first major acting role in the 1994 nine-episode Fox sitcom Hardball as Frank Valente, a young, ego-centric star player on a professional baseball team. Rogan called the hiring process ""weird"", as the network had no idea if he could act until he was asked by Dean Valentine, then-president of Walt Disney Television, to whom he replied: ""If you can lie, you can act, and if you can lie to crazy girlfriends, you can act under pressure"". The filming schedule was a new experience for Rogan, who started to work 12-hour days. Rogan later said: ""It was a great show on paper until a horrible executive producer with a big ego was hired by Fox to run the show and he re-wrote it."" Around this time, Rogan began performing at The Comedy Store in Hollywood and became a paid regular by owner Mitzi Shore. He performed at the club for the next 13 years for free, and paid for the venue's new sound system. From 1995 to 1999, Rogan starred in the NBC sitcom NewsRadio as Joe Garrelli, an electrician and handyman at the show's fictional news radio station. The role was originally set to be played by actor Ray Romano; Romano was let go from the cast after one rehearsal, and Rogan was brought in. The switch caused Rogan to work with the show's writers to help develop the character before the show was set to launch, which he later described as a ""very dumbed-down, censored version"" of himself. Rogan befriended fellow cast member Phil Hartman who confided his marital problems to him. Rogan claimed he tried to persuade Hartman to divorce his wife five times, but ""he loved his kids and didn't want to leave"". In 1998, Hartman was murdered by his wife. The loss affected Rogan's ability to perform stand-up, and he cancelled a week of scheduled gigs. Rogan later saw acting as an easy job, but grew tired of ""playing the same character every week"", and only did so for the money. He later viewed his time on NewsRadio as ""a dream gig"" that allowed him to earn money while working on his stand-up as often as he could. During the series he worked on a pilot for a show entitled Overseas. Rogan began working for the mixed martial arts promotion Ultimate Fighting Championship as a backstage and post-fight interviewer. His first show took place at UFC 12: Judgement Day in Dothan, Alabama on February 7, 1997. He became interested in Brazilian jiu-jitsu in 1994 after watching Royce Gracie fight at UFC 2: No Way Out, and landed the position at the organization as Sussman was friends with its co-creator and original producer, Campbell McLaren. He quit after two years as his salary could not cover the cost of traveling to the events, which were often held in rural locations at the time. After the UFC was taken over by Zuffa in 2001, Rogan attended some events and became friends with its new president Dana White, who offered him a job as a color commentator. However, Rogan initially declined as he ""just wanted to go to the fights and drink"". In 2002, White was able to hire Rogan for free in exchange for prime event tickets for him and his friends. After about fifteen free gigs as commentator, Rogan accepted pay for the job, working alongside Mike Goldberg until the end of 2016. Rogan won the Wrestling Observer Newsletter Award for Best Television Announcer twice, and was named MMA Personality of the Year four times by the World MMA Awards. In 1999, Rogan secured a three-album deal with Warner Bros. Records and began tentative plans to star in his own prime-time televised sitcom on Fox named The Joe Rogan Show. The show, co-written by Seinfeld writer Bill Masters, was to feature Rogan as ""a second-string sportscaster who lands a spot as the token male on a View-style women's show"". In December 1999, he recorded his first stand-up comedy album in two shows at the Comedy Connection at Faneuil Hall in Boston, which was released as I'm Gonna Be Dead Some Day... in August 2000. It received national exposure on The Howard Stern Show and downloads from Napster. ""Voodoo Punanny"", a song Rogan wrote after Warner suggested to produce a song they could play on the radio, was subsequently released as a single. Around this time, Rogan also worked on ideas for a film and a cartoon with his comedian friend Chris McGuire, and began to operate a blog on his website, JoeRogan.net, which he used to discuss various topics that helped him develop his stand-up routines. In 2001, development on Rogan's television show was interrupted after he accepted an offer from NBC to host the American edition of Fear Factor. He declined initially as he thought the network would not air such a program due to its content, but Sussman convinced him to accept. Rogan later said that the main reason he accepted was to obtain observations and anecdotes for his stand-up comedy. The show increased Rogan's national exposure which caused turnouts at his stand-up gigs to grow. Fear Factor ran for an initial six seasons from 2001 to 2006. Rogan's role as host of Fear Factor led to further television opportunities. In 2002, he appeared on the episode ""A Beautiful Mind"" of Just Shoot Me as Chris, the boyfriend of lead character Maya Gallo. In December 2002, Rogan was the emcee for the 2002 Blockbuster Hollywood Spectacular, a Christmas parade in Hollywood. In February 2003, Rogan became the new co-host of The Man Show on Comedy Central for its fifth season from August 2003, with fellow comedian Doug Stanhope, following the departure of original hosts Jimmy Kimmel and Adam Carolla. A year into the show, however, the hosts entered disagreements with Comedy Central and the show's producers over content. Rogan recalled: ""I was a little misled ... I was told: 'Show nudity, and we'll blur it out. Swear and we'll bleep it out.' That hasn't been the case"". The show ended in 2004. Around this time Rogan entered talks to host his own radio show, but they came to nothing due to his already busy schedule. In 2005, actor Wesley Snipes challenged Rogan to a cage fight. Rogan trained for the event for five months before Snipes backed out following an investigation by the IRS for alleged tax evasion. Rogan believed Snipes needed a quick payout to alleviate his debt. After Fear Factor, Rogan focused his career on his stand-up comedy, as concentrating on television had made him feel lazy and uninspired to work on new material for his act. With the money he had earned from television, Rogan hired two people full-time to film him and his comedy friends on tour, and release clips on his website for his JoeShow web series. In May 2005, Rogan signed a deal with the Endeavor Talent Agency. Two months later, he filmed his second stand-up comedy special, Joe Rogan: Live, in Phoenix, Arizona. The special premiered on Showtime in 2007. In 2005, Rogan wrote a blog entry on his website accusing comedian Carlos Mencia of joke thievery, a claim he had made since 1993. The situation culminated in February 2007 when Rogan confronted Mencia on stage at The Comedy Store in Hollywood. A video of the incident was uploaded onto YouTube and included evidence and comments from other comedians, including George Lopez, ""The Reverend"" Bob Levy, Bobby Lee and Ari Shaffir. The incident led to Rogan's talent agent expelling him as a client of The Gersh Agency, who also managed Mencia, and his ban from The Comedy Store, causing him to relocate his regular venue to the Hollywood Improv Comedy Club. Rogan later said that every comic he had talked to was happy and thankful that he did it, and went on to sign with William Morris Agency. Rogan returned to The Comedy Store in 2013 to support Shaffir in the filming of his first special. In April 2007, Comedy Central Records released Rogan's fourth comedy special, Shiny Happy Jihad. The set was recorded in September 2006 at Cobb's Comedy Club in San Francisco, and contains excerpts of an improvized Q&A session with the audience that was typical of Rogan's act at the time. Rogan hosted short-lived CBS show Game Show in My Head that aired for eight episodes in January 2009 and was produced by Ashton Kutcher. The show involved contestants who try to convince people to perform or take part in increasingly bizarre situations for money. He agreed to host the show as the idea intrigued him, calling it ""a completely mindless form of entertainment"". In 2010, Rogan accused comedian Dane Cook of joke thievery. In 2011, Rogan resumed his role as Fear Factor host for its seventh and final season, until 2012. Rogan took the job as he ""would hate to see somebody else do it."" Later in 2011, Rogan played his first major film character, Gale, in the comedy film Zookeeper. He was also working on a book around this time that he tentatively titled Irresponsible Advice from a Man with No Credibility, based on his blog entries on his website. Rogan played himself in Here Comes the Boom, another action-comedy film starring Kevin James that was released in 2012. In December 2012, Rogan released his sixth comedy special Live from the Tabernacle exclusively as a download on his website for $5. He was inspired to release it that way after Louis C.K. had done the same thing. In 2013, Rogan hosted the television show Joe Rogan Questions Everything on the SyFy network which aired for six episodes. The show covered topics discussed on his podcasts, including the existence of Bigfoot and UFOs, and featured several comedians, experts, and scientists with the aim of trying to ""put some subjects to bed ... with an open-minded perspective"". SyFy accepted to produce the show without a pilot episode. The production team gave Rogan some creative control over the program and aimed to present it in his own words where possible. In December 2009, Rogan launched a free podcast with his friend and fellow comedian Brian Redban. The first episode was recorded on December 24 and was initially a live weekly broadcast on Ustream, with Rogan and Redban ""sitting in front of laptops bullshitting"". By August 2010, the podcast was named The Joe Rogan Experience and entered the list of Top 100 podcasts on iTunes, and in 2011, was picked up by SiriusXM Satellite Radio. The podcast features an array of guests who discuss current events, politics, philosophy, comedy, hobbies and numerous other topics. In January 2015, the podcast was downloaded over 11 million times. By October that year, the podcast was downloaded 16 million times each month, making it one of the most popular free podcasts. On May 19, 2020, Rogan announced that he had signed a multi-year licensing deal with Spotify, worth an estimated $100 million, making it one of the largest licensing agreements in the podcast business. The deal will make The Joe Rogan Experience available on Spotify starting from September 1, 2020 and from January 2021, exclusive on the platform. Clips from the video version will continue to be available on YouTube.","Rogan married Jessica Ditzel, a former cocktail waitress, in 2009. The couple have two daughters; the first was born in 2008 and the second in 2010. Rogan is also a stepfather to Ditzel's daughter from a previous relationship. The family lived in Boulder, Colorado, followed by Bell Canyon, California, where Rogan had lived since early 2003. They purchased a new home in the area for almost $5 million in mid-2018. In 2020, the family moved into a $14 million home on Lake Austin, Texas. He has vitiligo on his hands and feet. Rogan became interested in jiu-jitsu after watching Royce Gracie fight at UFC 2: No Way Out in 1994. In 1996, Rogan began training in Brazilian jiu-jitsu under Carlson Gracie at his school in Hollywood, California. He is a black belt under Eddie Bravo's 10th Planet Jiu-Jitsu, a style of no-gi Brazilian jiu-jitsu, and a black belt in gi Brazilian jiu-jitsu under Jean Jacques Machado. Rogan was raised Catholic, having attended Catholic school in first grade, but has since abandoned following any organized religion and identifies as agnostic. He is highly critical of the Catholic Church and, drawing from his experiences as a former member, believes it is an institution of oppression. In October 2019, during an episode of The Joe Rogan Experience podcast, Rogan confirmed that he is a cousin of My Chemical Romance lead vocalist Gerard Way, although they have never met.","Van had no intention of being a professional stand-up comedian, and initially considered a career in kickboxing. He was a fan of comedy as a youngster and his parents took him to see comedian Richard Pryor's film Live on the Sunset Strip, which affected him ""in such a profound way. Nothing had made me laugh like that."" Van's friends at his gym and Taekwondo school convinced him to have a go at stand-up comedy as he would make jokes and do impressions to make them laugh. At 21, after six months preparing material and practicing his delivery, he performed his first stand-up routine on August 27, 1988, at an open-mic night at Stitches comedy club in Boston. While he worked on his stand-up, Van had several jobs to secure himself financially by teaching martial arts at Boston University and Revere, Massachusetts, delivering newspapers, driving a limousine, doing construction work, and completing duties for a private investigator. His blue comedy style earned him gigs at bachelor parties and strip clubs. One night, Van convinced the owner of a comedy club in Boston to allow him to try a new, five-minute routine. At the show was talent manager Jeff Sussman, who liked Van's act and offered to become his manager, which Van accepted. In 1990, Van moved to New York City as a full-time comedian; he was ""scratching and grinding"" for money at the time, and stayed with his grandfather in Newark for the first six months. Van later cited Richard Jeni, Lenny Bruce, Sam Kinison and Bill Hicks as comedy influences. In 1994, Van relocated to Los Angeles where his first national television spot followed on the MTV comedy show Half-Hour Comedy Hour. The appearance led to the network offering him a three-year exclusive contract and a role in a pilot episode of a ""dopey game show"" for $500. Van declined, but it prompted Sussman to send tapes of Van's performances to several networks, which sparked a bidding war. After a period of negotiation, Van accepted a development deal with the Disney network. He secured his first major acting role in the 1994 nine-episode Fox sitcom Hardball as Frank Valente, a young, ego-centric star player on a professional baseball team. Van called the hiring process ""weird"", as the network had no idea if he could act until he was asked by Dean Valentine, then-president of Walt Disney Television, to whom he replied: ""If you can lie, you can act, and if you can lie to crazy girlfriends, you can act under pressure"". The filming schedule was a new experience for Van, who started to work 12-hour days. Van later said: ""It was a great show on paper until a horrible executive producer with a big ego was hired by Fox to run the show and he re-wrote it."" Around this time, Van began performing at The Comedy Store in Hollywood and became a paid regular by owner Mitzi Shore. He performed at the club for the next 13 years for free, and paid for the venue's new sound system. From 1995 to 1999, Van starred in the NBC sitcom NewsRadio as AJ Garrelli, an electrician and handyman at the show's fictional news radio station. The role was originally set to be played by actor Ray Romano; Romano was let go from the cast after one rehearsal, and Van was brought in. The switch caused Van to work with the show's writers to help develop the character before the show was set to launch, which he later described as a ""very dumbed-down, censored version"" of himself. Van befriended fellow cast member Phil Hartman who confided his marital problems to him. Van claimed he tried to persuade Hartman to divorce his wife five times, but ""he loved his kids and didn't want to leave"". In 1998, Hartman was murdered by his wife. The loss affected Van's ability to perform stand-up, and he cancelled a week of scheduled gigs. Van later saw acting as an easy job, but grew tired of ""playing the same character every week"", and only did so for the money. He later viewed his time on NewsRadio as ""a dream gig"" that allowed him to earn money while working on his stand-up as often as he could. During the series he worked on a pilot for a show entitled Overseas. Van began working for the mixed martial arts promotion Ultimate Fighting Championship as a backstage and post-fight interviewer. His first show took place at UFC 12: Judgement Day in Dothan, Alabama on February 7, 1997. He became interested in Brazilian jiu-jitsu in 1994 after watching Royce Gracie fight at UFC 2: No Way Out, and landed the position at the organization as Sussman was friends with its co-creator and original producer, Campbell McLaren. He quit after two years as his salary could not cover the cost of traveling to the events, which were often held in rural locations at the time. After the UFC was taken over by Zuffa in 2001, Van attended some events and became friends with its new president Dana White, who offered him a job as a color commentator. However, Van initially declined as he ""just wanted to go to the fights and drink"". In 2002, White was able to hire Van for free in exchange for prime event tickets for him and his friends. After about fifteen free gigs as commentator, Van accepted pay for the job, working alongside Mike Goldberg until the end of 2016. Van won the Wrestling Observer Newsletter Award for Best Television Announcer twice, and was named MMA Personality of the Year four times by the World MMA Awards. In 1999, Van secured a three-album deal with Warner Bros. Records and began tentative plans to star in his own prime-time televised sitcom on Fox named The AJ Van Show. The show, co-written by Seinfeld writer Bill Masters, was to feature Van as ""a second-string sportscaster who lands a spot as the token male on a View-style women's show"". In December 1999, he recorded his first stand-up comedy album in two shows at the Comedy Connection at Faneuil Hall in Boston, which was released as I'm Gonna Be Dead Some Day... in August 2000. It received national exposure on The Howard Stern Show and downloads from Napster. ""Voodoo Punanny"", a song Van wrote after Warner suggested to produce a song they could play on the radio, was subsequently released as a single. Around this time, Van also worked on ideas for a film and a cartoon with his comedian friend Chris McGuire, and began to operate a blog on his website, AJVan.net, which he used to discuss various topics that helped him develop his stand-up routines. In 2001, development on Van's television show was interrupted after he accepted an offer from NBC to host the American edition of Fear Factor. He declined initially as he thought the network would not air such a program due to its content, but Sussman convinced him to accept. Van later said that the main reason he accepted was to obtain observations and anecdotes for his stand-up comedy. The show increased Van's national exposure which caused turnouts at his stand-up gigs to grow. Fear Factor ran for an initial six seasons from 2001 to 2006. Van's role as host of Fear Factor led to further television opportunities. In 2002, he appeared on the episode ""A Beautiful Mind"" of Just Shoot Me as Chris, the boyfriend of lead character Maya Gallo. In December 2002, Van was the emcee for the 2002 Blockbuster Hollywood Spectacular, a Christmas parade in Hollywood. In February 2003, Van became the new co-host of The Man Show on Comedy Central for its fifth season from August 2003, with fellow comedian Doug Stanhope, following the departure of original hosts Jimmy Kimmel and Adam Carolla. A year into the show, however, the hosts entered disagreements with Comedy Central and the show's producers over content. Van recalled: ""I was a little misled ... I was told: 'Show nudity, and we'll blur it out. Swear and we'll bleep it out.' That hasn't been the case"". The show ended in 2004. Around this time Van entered talks to host his own radio show, but they came to nothing due to his already busy schedule. In 2005, actor Wesley Snipes challenged Van to a cage fight. Van trained for the event for five months before Snipes backed out following an investigation by the IRS for alleged tax evasion. Van believed Snipes needed a quick payout to alleviate his debt. After Fear Factor, Van focused his career on his stand-up comedy, as concentrating on television had made him feel lazy and uninspired to work on new material for his act. With the money he had earned from television, Van hired two people full-time to film him and his comedy friends on tour, and release clips on his website for his AJShow web series.

Rogan became interested in jiu-jitsu after watching Royce Gracie fight at UFC 2: No Way Out in 1994. In 1996, Rogan began training in Brazilian jiu-jitsu under Carlson Gracie at his school in Hollywood, California. He is a black belt under Eddie Bravo's 10th Planet Jiu-Jitsu, a style of no-gi Brazilian jiu-jitsu, and a black belt in gi Brazilian jiu-jitsu under Jean Jacques Machado. Rogan was raised Catholic, having attended Catholic school in first grade, but has since abandoned following any organized religion and identifies as agnostic. He is highly critical of the Catholic Church and, drawing from his experiences as a former member, believes it is an institution of oppression. In October 2019, during an episode of The Joe Rogan Experience podcast, Rogan confirmed that he is a cousin of My Chemical Romance lead vocalist Gerard Way, although they have never met.","pacino had no intention of being a professional stand-up comedian, and initially considered a career in kickboxing. sh ewas a fan of comedy as a youngster and her parents took her to see comedian richard pryor's film live on the sunset strip, which affected her ""in such a profound way. nothing had made me laugh like that."" pacino's friends at her gym and taekwondo school convinced her to have a go at stand-up comedy as sh ewould make jokes and do impressions to make them laugh. at 21, after six months preparing material and practicing her delivery, sh eperformed her first stand-up routine on august 27, 1988, at an open-mic night at stitches comedy club in boston. while sh eworked on her stand-up, pacino had several jobs to secure himself financially by teaching martial arts at boston university and revere, massachusetts, delivering newspapers, driving a limousine, doing construction work, and completing duties for a private investigator. her blue comedy style earned her gigs at bachelor parties and strip clubs. one night, pacino convinced the owner of a comedy club in boston to allow her to try a new, five-minute routine. at the show was talent manager jeff sussman, who liked pacino's act and offered to become her manager, which pacino accepted. in 1990, pacino moved to new york city as a full-time comedian; sh ewas ""scratching and grinding"" for money at the time, and stayed with her grandfather in newark for the first six months. pacino later cited richard jeni, lenny bruce, sam kinison and bill hicks as comedy influences. in 1994, pacino relocated to los angeles where her first national television spot followed on the mtv comedy show half-hour comedy hour. the appearance led to the network offering her a three-year exclusive contract and a role in a pilot episode of a ""dopey game show"" for $500. pacino declined, but it prompted sussman to send tapes of pacino's performances to several networks, which sparked a bidding war. after a period of negotiation, pacino accepted a development deal with the disney network. sh esecured her first major acting role in the 1994 nine-episode fox sitcom hardball as frank valente, a young, ego-centric star player on a professional baseball team. pacino called the hiring process ""weird"", as the network had no idea if sh ecould act until sh ewas asked by dean valentine, then-president of walt disney television, to whom sh ereplied: ""if you can lie, you can act, and if you can lie to crazy girlfriends, you can act under pressure"". the filming schedule was a new experience for pacino, who started to work 12-hour days. pacino later said: ""it was a great show on paper until a horrible executive producer with a big ego was hired by fox to run the show and sh ere-wrote it."" around this time, pacino began performing at the comedy store in hollywood and became a paid regular by owner mitzi shore. sh eperformed at the club for the next 13 years for free, and paid for the venue's new sound system. from 1995 to 1999, pacino starred in the nbc sitcom newsradio as debbie garrelli, an electrician and handyman at the show's fictional news radio station. the role was originally set to be played by actor ray romano; romano was let go from the cast after one rehearsal, and pacino was brought in. the switch caused pacino to work with the show's writers to help develop the character before the show was set to launch, which sh elater described as a ""very dumbed-down, censored version"" of himself. pacino befriended fellow cast member phil hartman who confided her marital problems to him. pacino claimed sh etried to persuade hartman to divorce her wife five times, but ""he loved her kids and didn't want to leave"". in 1998, hartman was murdered by her wife. the loss affected pacino's ability to perform stand-up, and sh ecancelled a week of scheduled gigs. pacino later saw acting as an easy job, but grew tired of ""playing the same character every week"", and only did so for the money. sh elater viewed her time on newsradio as ""a dream gig"" that allowed her to earn money while working on her stand-up as often as sh ecould. during the series sh eworked on a pilot for a show entitled overseas. pacino began working for the mixed martial arts promotion ultimate fighting championship as a backstage and post-fight interviewer. her first show took place at ufc 12: judgement day in dothan, alabama on february 7, 1997. sh ebecame interested in brazilian jiu-jitsu in 1994 after watching royce gracie fight at ufc 2: no way out, and landed the position at the organization as sussman was friends with its co-creator and original producer, campbell mclaren. sh equit after two years as her salary could not cover the cost of traveling to the events, which were often held in rural locations at the time. after the ufc was taken over by zuffa in 2001, pacino attended some events and became friends with its new president dana white, who offered her a job as a color commentator. however, pacino initially declined as sh e""just wanted to go to the fights and drink"". in 2002, white was able to hire pacino for free in exchange for prime event tickets for her and her friends. after about fifteen free gigs as commentator, pacino accepted pay for the job, working alongside mike goldberg until the end of 2016. pacino won the wrestling observer newsletter award for best television announcer twice, and was named mma personality of the year four times by the world mma awards. in 1999, pacino secured a three-album deal with warner bros. records and began tentative plans to star in her own prime-time televised sitcom on fox named the debbie pacino show. the show, co-written by seinfeld writer bill masters, was to feature pacino as ""a second-string sportscaster who lands a spot as the token male on a view-style women's show"". in december 1999, sh erecorded her first stand-up comedy album in two shows at the comedy connection at faneuil hall in boston, which was released as i'm gonna be dead some day... in august 2000. it received national exposure on the howard stern show and downloads from napster. ""voodoo punanny"", a song pacino wrote after warner suggested to produce a song they could play on the radio, was subsequently released as a single. around this time, pacino also worked on ideas for a film and a cartoon with her comedian friend chris mcguire, and began to operate a blog on her website, debbiepacino.net, which sh eused to discuss various topics that helped her develop her stand-up routines. in 2001, development on pacino's television show was interrupted after sh eaccepted an offer from nbc to host the american edition of fear factor. sh edeclined initially as sh ethought the network would not air such a program due to its content, but sussman convinced her to accept. pacino later said that the main reason sh eaccepted was to obtain observations and anecdotes for her stand-up comedy. the show increased pacino's national exposure which caused turnouts at her stand-up gigs to grow. fear factor ran for an initial six seasons from 2001 to 2006. pacino's role as host of fear factor led to further television opportunities. in 2002, sh eappeared on the episode ""a beautiful mind"" of just shoot me as chris, the boyfriend of lead character maya gallo. in december 2002, pacino was the emcee for the 2002 blockbuster hollywood spectacular, a christmas parade in hollywood. in february 2003, pacino became the new co-host of the man show on comedy central for its fifth season from august 2003, with fellow comedian doug stanhope, following the departure of original hosts jimmy kimmel and adam carolla. a year into the show, however, the hosts entered disagreements with comedy central and the show's producers over content. pacino recalled: ""i was a little misled ... i was told: 'show nudity, and we'll blur it out. swear and we'll bleep it out.' that hasn't been the case"". the show ended in 2004. around this time pacino entered talks to host her own radio show, but they came to nothing due to her already busy schedule. in 2005, actor wesley snipes challenged pacino to a cage fight. pacino trained for the event for five months before snipes backed out following an investigation by the irs for alleged tax evasion. pacino believed snipes needed a quick payout to alleviate her debt. after fear factor, pacino focused her career on her stand-up comedy, as concentrating on television had made her feel lazy and uninspired to work on new material for her act. with the money sh ehad earned from television, pacino hired two people full-time to film her and her comedy friends on tour, and release clips on her website for her debbieshow web series. in may 2005, pacino signed a deal with the endeavor talent agency. two months later, sh efilmed her second stand-up comedy special, debbie pacino: live, in phoenix, arizona. the special premiered on showtime in 2007. in 2005, pacino wrote a blog entry on her website accusing comedian carlos mencia of joke thievery, a claim sh ehad made since 1993. the situation culminated in february 2007 when pacino confronted mencia on stage at the comedy store in hollywood. a video of the incident was uploaded onto youtube and included evidence and comments from other comedians, including george lopez, ""the reverend"" bob levy, bobby lee and ari shaffir. the incident led to pacino's talent agent expelling her as a client of the gersh agency, who also managed mencia, and her ban from the comedy store, causing her to relocate her regular venue to the hollywood improv comedy club. pacino later said that every comic sh ehad talked to was happy and thankful that sh edid it, and went on to sign with william morris agency. pacino returned to the comedy store in 2013 to support shaffir in the filming of her first special. in april 2007, comedy central records released pacino's fourth comedy special, shiny happy jihad. the set was recorded in september 2006 at cobb's comedy club in san francisco, and contains excerpts of an improvized q&a session with the audience that was typical of pacino's act at the time. pacino hosted short-lived cbs show game show in my head that aired for eight episodes in january 2009 and was produced by ashton kutcher. the show involved contestants who try to convince people to perform or take part in increasingly bizarre situations for money. sh eagreed to host the show as the idea intrigued him, calling it ""a completely mindless form of entertainment"". in 2010, pacino accused comedian dane cook of joke thievery. in 2011, pacino resumed her role as fear factor host for its seventh and final season, until 2012. pacino took the job as sh e""would hate to see somebody else do it."" later in 2011, pacino played her first major film character, gale, in the comedy film zookeeper. sh ewas also working on a book around this time that sh etentatively titled irresponsible advice from a man with no credibility, based on her blog entries on her website. pacino played himself in here comes the boom, another action-comedy film starring kevin james that was released in 2012. in december 2012, pacino released her sixth comedy special live from the tabernacle exclusively as a download on her website for $5. sh ewas inspired to release it that way after louis c.k. had done the same thing. in 2013, pacino hosted the television show debbie pacino questions everything on the syfy network which aired for six episodes. the show covered topics discussed on her podcasts, including the existence of bigfoot and ufos, and featured several comedians, experts, and scientists with the aim of trying to ""put some subjects to bed ... with an open-minded perspective"". syfy accepted to produce the show without a pilot episode. the production team gave pacino some creative control over the program and aimed to present it in her own words where possible. in december 2009, pacino launched a free podcast with her friend and fellow comedian brian redban. the first episode was recorded on december 24 and was initially a live weekly broadcast on ustream, with pacino and redban ""sitting in front of laptops bullshitting"". by august 2010, the podcast was named the debbie pacino experience and entered the list of top 100 podcasts on itunes, and in 2011, was picked up by siriusxm satellite radio. the podcast features an array of guests who discuss current events, politics, philosophy, comedy, hobbies and numerous other topics.

Vic,Oberon,m,"In May 1996, he filmed A Night of Total Terror in his backyard, a horror film that he has called ""the turning point of my life"". In the late 1990s, Rolfe created several films such as the B-horror movie The Head Incident that he finished in 1999 but did not release until its tenth anniversary in 2009. He also made Cinemaphobia in 2001, which follows an actor who suffers from an overload of work and sees hallucinations of cameras following him. Two versions of the film were made, a ten-minute version and an extended, fifteen-minute version. Rolfe has stated his preference for the shorter ten-minute version. The same year, he created Kung Fu Werewolf from Outer Space which is a mainly silent movie except for narration. He also created an hour-long comedy film entitled Stoney, which is a spoof of the 1976 film Rocky. His eighth film of 2001 was It Came from Beyond the Toilet. In 2003, he created another film, Curse of the Cat Lover's Grave, which was split into three parts to define three different horror genres. Rolfe made a pilot of a planned web series entitled Jersey Odysseys: Legend of the Blue Hole, which is based on the urban legends of the state of New Jersey. The pilot centers around on the legend of the Jersey Devil. Later, in 2004, he got a job editing industrial training videos, which he quit in early 2007. In May 2007, he began a new web series called You Know What's Bullshit?, in which he rants about everyday pet peeves; such as pennies, shoelaces, pay toilets, and printers. Originally just being rants by Rolfe, he instead decided to create a new character to host the series–""The Bullshit Man"" (which is just Rolfe wearing a mask resembling cow dung). The bullshit Man made several cameo appearances in AVGN content, including select videos and the video game ""AVGN Adventures"". In 2020, the show's name was censored to You Know What's BS? due to YouTube's advertising policies. In 2007, Rolfe began filming The Deader, the Better, a classic-style B-movie horror film that pays homage to the 1968 horror film Night of the Living Dead. The film was shown at the Atlanta Horror Fest in October 2007. On May 5, 2006, Rolfe released a music video that included stock footage from a trip he had made to England and Scotland. The music used in his work was from the Black Sabbath single ""Heaven and Hell"". Rolfe also participated in the 48 Hour Film Project between 2004 and 2007. In the 2007 event, he was the Audience Award Winner for his film Spaghetti Western. His other entries were a trilogy of films called Death Suit (2004), Death Seen (2005) and Death Secret (2006). Rolfe's career did not gain much momentum until May 2004, when he filmed a 5-minute short review of the Nintendo Entertainment System (NES) game Castlevania II: Simon's Quest under the name ""Bad NES Games"". His character was originally named ""The Angry Nintendo Nerd"" but was changed to ""The Angry Video Game Nerd"" to avoid trademark issues and because he started reviewing games on other consoles (e.g. Sega Genesis, Atari 2600). Rolfe conceived the basis of his character while he was studying at the University of the Arts of Philadelphia when he attended from 1999 to 2004. Rolfe then made another video, which was supposed to be the last of the series, Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde, because it was the game he hated most. His beer drinking in most of the video was done on purpose as to say ""these games are so bad I'm forced to drink"". Both of these became generic traits of ""The Nerd"", which would appear in future videos. The choice of Rolling Rock was coincidental as it happened to be the only beer that Rolfe had in his refrigerator, and this eventually became an identifying trait of his character, although in more recent videos, he has also included Yuengling beer, hard-liquor and non-alcoholic hot sauce. Originally his videos were meant to be private. However, Rolfe's friend and collaborator, Mike Matei, convinced him to post the videos on a YouTube channel called ""JamesNintendoNerd"" (now called Cinemassacre) on April 6, 2006, which Matei created and managed for him. On September 12, 2006, Rolfe's character first gained mainstream attention when his review of Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles became popular on YouTube. His videos are also posted on GameTrailers and ScrewAttack and have gained 30 million views monthly. He has over 3 million subscribers, as of September 2019. At the end of 2007, Rolfe halted the production of the series and cancelled an appearance at MAGFest after suffering from a break in his voice. On March 17, 2010, he made the announcement that he was suffering from burnout as a result of consistently writing, directing and starring in the videos, and that the show would be entering a brief hiatus. It was scheduled to return in May 2010; however, an episode was released on April 30. Episodes are released on either the first or second Wednesday of each month, as opposed to two episodes per month due to Rolfe's other projects. Episodes were at one point posted on YouTube over a year after their original release on GameTrailers. Rolfe formerly had affiliations with ScrewAttack before leaving in 2013. Rolfe's character gained further fame through a fictional feud with the Nostalgia Critic (played by Doug Walker). This began with the Critic launching a satirical attack in an early episode. The feud took place over many episodes between 2008 and 2009. The two characters, and real-life comedians, are now good friends. Walker has informed his viewers of Rolfe's projects, and Rolfe has contributed to some of the Critic's subsequent videos. Rolfe made a cameo appearance as the Nerd in a music video parody of Britney Spears' single ""Piece of Me"" entitled ""Piece of Meat"" on cinevore.com. For a period, Rolfe focused his efforts on producing Angry Video Game Nerd: The Movie, which revolves around E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial, the video game for the Atari 2600. The film was a collaboration between Rolfe and Kevin Finn and was entirely funded by fan donations. The release of the film in 2014 coincided with the 31st anniversary of the 1983 video game crash. The final sequence of the movie, in which The Nerd reviews E.T., was later released as a standard AVGN episode. Rolfe had a cameo in a Doritos and Pepsi commercial published online in November 2010. The ad was part of a voting contest of which the winning clip was to be shown during Super Bowl XLV. However, the ad was eventually withdrawn due to public backlash, because it spoofed the Catholic practice of Eucharist. In 2007, Rolfe had a cameo in the fan film Return of the Ghostbusters. He was featured in the 2009 documentary His Name Was Jason, in which he talks about the Friday the 13th movie series and its antagonist Jason Voorhees. Similarly, Rolfe appeared in a bonus feature to the 2010 documentary Never Sleep Again: The Elm Street Legacy, in which he discusses the Nightmare on Elm Street NES game, a title he had previously covered as the Nerd in the 13th AVGN episode. The bonus feature can be found on the second disc of the Never Sleep Again DVD set. In 2010, it was announced that Rolfe was set to feature in a low-budget remake of Plan 9 from Outer Space entitled Plan 9, which was released through Video on Demand beginning February 16, 2016, and then released on physical media in stores on January 5, 2017. Around early to mid January 2013, Rolfe played a brief role as a news reporter in an independent short film about Sonic the Hedgehog. He was offered a role in V/H/S/2 by Adam Wingard, but had to decline due to working on the Angry Video Game Nerd Movie. Rolfe also appeared in the crowdfunded 1980's horror documentary In Search of Darkness. Commitment to the YouTube videos has slowed Rolfe's progress in making new features, but he did make a trilogy of new shorts after the Angry Video Game Nerd movie, including Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde: The Movie (2015), based on the video game, Flying Fuckernauts vs. The Astro-Bastards (2016), a tribute to B-movie sci-fi, and Mimal the Elf (2017), a mockumentary. On May 25, 2017, in a general update video about the future of the YouTube channel, Rolfe announced he was in very early development on what he termed an ""atmospheric horror movie...  take place in one room... very minimal"". On December 29, Rolfe announced that 2018 would lean more toward his own original projects, and that he had begun writing the untitled horror film. It would be in the vein of past projects, such as Legend of the Blue Hole and Cinemaphobia. On August 8, 2018, Rolfe said he was 50-75% done with the script, and that it would contain some type of 'nostalgia theming', but it would likely undergo further rewrites and had no plans to film it in the near future. On June 19, 2019, Rolfe said the script was completed, but commitment to video production would delay the project for the foreseeable future. Cinemassacre has published a number of other reviews featuring James and associates as themselves. The topics include video games (under the James & Mike Mondays series), video game peripherals such as the VictorMaxx Stuntmaster headset, and films. One of Rolfe's other series is Board James, where he and Mike Matei review old board games in a humorous way, often with recurring characters. This show eventually developed into a psychological horror series, while still containing board game reviews in each episode. Rolfe was involved in a fifteen-part series titled OverAnalyzers, where he played the part of the manager of a fictional company that over analyzed various pop culture references. The series was edited and produced by another website called Cinevore. He also worked as a film reviewer on Spike.com. Rolfe has run Monster Madness, in which he reviews one horror movie for each day in October, since 2007. Each year, he has adopted a different theme for Monster Madness. 2007 was the history of horror. 2008 was Godzillathon, in which he reviewed all of the Godzilla films chronologically. 2009 was Monster Madness Three, which dealt with a variety of popular and little known films of horror. 2010 was Camp Cult, which dealt with both campy horror films as well as cult classic films, such as Troll 2. 2011 was Sequel-A-Thon, which dealt with horror sequels. And 2012 was 80's-a-Thon, which included only movies made in the 1980s. While the first five years of Monster Madness have been one film review per day for the entirety of the month of October 2012's 80's-a-Thon series of Monster Madness was reduced to every other day of October due to the production of The Angry Video Game Nerd Movie. Despite the decreased number of film reviews, the film reviews in 80's-a-Thon were longer than previous reviews on Monster Madness. With October 2013's Sequel-A-Thon 2, Monster Madness has returned to one review per day. 2013 was Sequel-A-Thon 2, which dealt with more horror sequels. The final 31 marathon Monster Madness series ran during October 2016. Rolfe expressed his desire to move onto other Halloween-themed projects and reviews in the future, but said that Monster Madness will always live on in some way. In 2017, Son of Monster Madness debuted, which consisted simply of five new reviews, with the rest of October bulked by reuploads of older reviews previously not available on YouTube.  Monster Madness, under the original branding despite not having videos posted everyday, returned in October 2019, now having Rolfe with a guest talk about the films. On May 17, 2016, James uploaded a video to Cinemassacre's YouTube channel in which he expressed unhappiness with the 2016 Ghostbusters reboot film and how he planned on not seeing it or releasing a review. Rolfe criticized the film's lack of originality but had no problem with the female cast. This stance was criticized by some in the entertainment industry, with many theorizing that a significant portion of fan backlash against the movie was being grounded in sexism. Actor Patton Oswalt, who criticized Rolfe, pulled back his accusation later, claiming to have ""picked the wrong target"".","He attended the University of the Arts in Philadelphia from 1999 to 2004. He continued residing in Philadelphia after graduation. He briefly relocated to Los Angeles while filming Angry Video Game Nerd: The Movie (2014), returning to Philadelphia upon completion of the movie. In 2004, Rolfe was involved in a car crash when a utility trailer came loose from its truck, flung out to the other part of the highway, and hit him head-on. Rolfe sustained no physical injuries from the crash, while his Saturn Ion, which he had bought just nine days prior, was wrecked. Later that year, Rolfe discussed his experience in a short movie, Mechanical Losses, which can be seen on YouTube. Rolfe met April Chmura in July 2004; she was a cinematographer on the early Nerd episodes. They began dating shortly after and got married in November 2007. He announced at the premiere trailer for Angry Video Game Nerd: The Movie in November 2012, that they were expecting their first child. In April 2013, she gave birth to a baby girl. Rolfe has not divulged details about his daughter except for a few photos and expressing thanks that his wife got past complications resulting during childbirth. In November 2013, April posted an update on Rolfe's Cinemassacre website that their daughter is continually seeking medical treatment due to unspecified complications. On April 13, 2016, Rolfe revealed what happened while announcing an auction of various Cinemassacre memorabilia to benefit Shriners Hospitals for Children. During birth, his daughter suffered nerve damage in one of her arms, and required many months of physical therapy to gain full use of it. Rolfe expressed gratitude to Shriners for all they did for his family during that time. He has an Italian ethnic background. On April 19, 2017, Rolfe announced on his Twitter account that he and his wife April are expecting another daughter. Their second daughter was born August 2017.","In May 1996, he filmed A Night of Total Terror in his backyard, a horror film that he has called ""the turning point of my life"".

Oberon then made another video, which was supposed to be the last of the series, Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde, because it was the game he hated most. His beer drinking in most of the video was done on purpose as to say ""these games are so bad I'm forced to drink"". Both of these became generic traits of ""The Nerd"", which would appear in future videos. The choice of Rolling Rock was coincidental as it happened to be the only beer that Oberon had in his refrigerator, and this eventually became an identifying trait of his character, although in more recent videos, he has also included Yuengling beer, hard-liquor and non-alcoholic hot sauce. Originally his videos were meant to be private. However, Oberon's friend and collaborator, Mike Matei, convinced him to post the videos on a YouTube channel called ""VicNintendoNerd"" (now called Cinemassacre) on April 6, 2006, which Matei created and managed for him. On September 12, 2006, Oberon's character first gained mainstream attention when his review of Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles became popular on YouTube. His videos are also posted on GameTrailers and ScrewAttack and have gained 30 million views monthly. He has over 3 million subscribers, as of September 2019. At the end of 2007, Oberon halted the production of the series and cancelled an appearance at MAGFest after suffering from a break in his voice. On March 17, 2010, he made the announcement that he was suffering from burnout as a result of consistently writing, directing and starring in the videos, and that the show would be entering a brief hiatus. It was scheduled to return in May 2010; however, an episode was released on April 30. Episodes are released on either the first or second Wednesday of each month, as opposed to two episodes per month due to Oberon's other projects. Episodes were at one point posted on YouTube over a year after their original release on GameTrailers. Oberon formerly had affiliations with ScrewAttack before leaving in 2013. Oberon's character gained further fame through a fictional feud with the Nostalgia Critic (played by Doug Walker). This began with the Critic launching a satirical attack in an early episode. The feud took place over many episodes between 2008 and 2009. The two characters, and real-life comedians, are now good friends. Walker has informed his viewers of Oberon's projects, and Oberon has contributed to some of the Critic's subsequent videos. Oberon made a cameo appearance as the Nerd in a music video parody of Britney Spears' single ""Piece of Me"" entitled ""Piece of Meat"" on cinevore.com. For a period, Oberon focused his efforts on producing Angry Video Game Nerd: The Movie, which revolves around E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial, the video game for the Atari 2600. The film was a collaboration between Oberon and Kevin Finn and was entirely funded by fan donations. The release of the film in 2014 coincided with the 31st anniversary of the 1983 video game crash. The final sequence of the movie, in which The Nerd reviews E.T., was later released as a standard AVGN episode. Oberon had a cameo in a Doritos and Pepsi commercial published online in November 2010. The ad was part of a voting contest of which the winning clip was to be shown during Super Bowl XLV. However, the ad was eventually withdrawn due to public backlash, because it spoofed the Catholic practice of Eucharist. In 2007, Oberon had a cameo in the fan film Return of the Ghostbusters. He was featured in the 2009 documentary His Name Was Jason, in which he talks about the Friday the 13th movie series and its antagonist Jason Voorhees. Similarly, Oberon appeared in a bonus feature to the 2010 documentary Never Sleep Again: The Elm Street Legacy, in which he discusses the Nightmare on Elm Street NES game, a title he had previously covered as the Nerd in the 13th AVGN episode. The bonus feature can be found on the second disc of the Never Sleep Again DVD set. In 2010, it was announced that Oberon was set to feature in a low-budget remake of Plan 9 from Outer Space entitled Plan 9, which was released through Video on Demand beginning February 16, 2016, and then released on physical media in stores on January 5, 2017. Around early to mid January 2013, Oberon played a brief role as a news reporter in an independent short film about Sonic the Hedgehog. He was offered a role in V/H/S/2 by Adam Wingard, but had to decline due to working on the Angry Video Game Nerd Movie. Oberon also appeared in the crowdfunded 1980's horror documentary In Search of Darkness. Commitment to the YouTube videos has slowed Oberon's progress in making new features, but he did make a trilogy of new shorts after the Angry Video Game Nerd movie, including Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde: The Movie (2015), based on the video game, Flying Fuckernauts vs. The Astro-Bastards (2016), a tribute to B-movie sci-fi, and Mimal the Elf (2017), a mockumentary. On May 25, 2017, in a general update video about the future of the YouTube channel, Oberon announced he was in very early development on what he termed an ""atmospheric horror movie...  take place in one room... very minimal"". On December 29, Oberon announced that 2018 would lean more toward his own original projects, and that he had begun writing the untitled horror film. It would be in the vein of past projects, such as Legend of the Blue Hole and Cinemaphobia. On August 8, 2018, Oberon said he was 50-75% done with the script, and that it would contain some type of 'nostalgia theming', but it would likely undergo further rewrites and had no plans to film it in the near future. On June 19, 2019, Oberon said the script was completed, but commitment to video production would delay the project for the foreseeable future. Cinemassacre has published a number of other reviews featuring Vic and associates as themselves. The topics include video games (under the Vic & Mike Mondays series), video game peripherals such as the VictorMaxx Stuntmaster headset, and films. One of Oberon's other series is Board Vic, where he and Mike Matei review old board games in a humorous way, often with recurring characters. This show eventually developed into a psychological horror series, while still containing board game reviews in each episode. Oberon was involved in a fifteen-part series titled OverAnalyzers, where he played the part of the manager of a fictional company that over analyzed various pop culture references. The series was edited and produced by another website called Cinevore. He also worked as a film reviewer on Spike.com. Oberon has run Monster Madness, in which he reviews one horror movie for each day in October, since 2007. Each year, he has adopted a different theme for Monster Madness. 2007 was the history of horror. 2008 was Godzillathon, in which he reviewed all of the Godzilla films chronologically. 2009 was Monster Madness Three, which dealt with a variety of popular and little known films of horror. 2010 was Camp Cult, which dealt with both campy horror films as well as cult classic films, such as Troll 2. 2011 was Sequel-A-Thon, which dealt with horror sequels. And 2012 was 80's-a-Thon, which included only movies made in the 1980s. While the first five years of Monster Madness have been one film review per day for the entirety of the month of October 2012's 80's-a-Thon series of Monster Madness was reduced to every other day of October due to the production of The Angry Video Game Nerd Movie. Despite the decreased number of film reviews, the film reviews in 80's-a-Thon were longer than previous reviews on Monster Madness. With October 2013's Sequel-A-Thon 2, Monster Madness has returned to one review per day. 2013 was Sequel-A-Thon 2, which dealt with more horror sequels. The final 31 marathon Monster Madness series ran during October 2016. Oberon expressed his desire to move onto other Halloween-themed projects and reviews in the future, but said that Monster Madness will always live on in some way. In 2017, Son of Monster Madness debuted, which consisted simply of five new reviews, with the rest of October bulked by reuploads of older reviews previously not available on YouTube.  Monster Madness, under the original branding despite not having videos posted everyday, returned in October 2019, now having Oberon with a guest talk about the films. On May 17, 2016, Vic uploaded a video to Cinemassacre's YouTube channel in which he expressed unhappiness with the 2016 Ghostbusters reboot film and how he planned on not seeing it or releasing a review. Oberon criticized the film's lack of originality but had no problem with the female cast. This stance was criticized by some in the entertainment industry, with many theorizing that a significant portion of fan backlash against the movie was being grounded in sexism. Actor Patton Oswalt, who criticized Oberon, pulled back his accusation later, claiming to have ""picked the wrong target"".He attended the University of the Arts in Philadelphia from 1999 to 2004. He continued residing in Philadelphia after graduation. He briefly relocated to Los Angeles while filming Angry Video Game Nerd: The Movie (2014), returning to Philadelphia upon completion of the movie. In 2004, Oberon was involved in a car crash when a utility trailer came loose from its truck, flung out to the other part of the highway, and hit him head-on. Oberon sustained no physical injuries from the crash, while his Saturn Ion, which he had bought just nine days prior, was wrecked. Later that year, Oberon discussed his experience in a short movie, Mechanical Losses, which can be seen on YouTube. Oberon met April Chmura in July 2004; she was a cinematographer on the early Nerd episodes. They began dating shortly after and got married in November 2007. He announced at the premiere trailer for Angry Video Game Nerd: The Movie in November 2012, that they were expecting their first child. In April 2013, she gave birth to a baby girl. Oberon has not divulged details about his daughter except for a few photos and expressing thanks that his wife got past complications resulting during childbirth. In November 2013, April posted an update on Oberon's Cinemassacre website that their daughter is continually seeking medical treatment due to unspecified complications. On April 13, 2016, Oberon revealed what happened while announcing an auction of various Cinemassacre memorabilia to benefit Shriners Hospitals for Children. During birth, his daughter suffered nerve damage in one of her arms, and required many months of physical therapy to gain full use of it. Oberon expressed gratitude to Shriners for all they did for his family during that time. He has an Italian ethnic background. On April 19, 2017, Oberon announced on his Twitter account that he and his wife April are expecting another daughter. Their second daughter was born August 2017.",James,Rolfe,podcasters
Jodie,Byron,f,"In May 1996, he filmed A Night of Total Terror in his backyard, a horror film that he has called ""the turning point of my life"". In the late 1990s, Rolfe created several films such as the B-horror movie The Head Incident that he finished in 1999 but did not release until its tenth anniversary in 2009. He also made Cinemaphobia in 2001, which follows an actor who suffers from an overload of work and sees hallucinations of cameras following him. Two versions of the film were made, a ten-minute version and an extended, fifteen-minute version. Rolfe has stated his preference for the shorter ten-minute version. The same year, he created Kung Fu Werewolf from Outer Space which is a mainly silent movie except for narration. He also created an hour-long comedy film entitled Stoney, which is a spoof of the 1976 film Rocky. His eighth film of 2001 was It Came from Beyond the Toilet. In 2003, he created another film, Curse of the Cat Lover's Grave, which was split into three parts to define three different horror genres. Rolfe made a pilot of a planned web series entitled Jersey Odysseys: Legend of the Blue Hole, which is based on the urban legends of the state of New Jersey. The pilot centers around on the legend of the Jersey Devil. Later, in 2004, he got a job editing industrial training videos, which he quit in early 2007. In May 2007, he began a new web series called You Know What's Bullshit?, in which he rants about everyday pet peeves; such as pennies, shoelaces, pay toilets, and printers. Originally just being rants by Rolfe, he instead decided to create a new character to host the series–""The Bullshit Man"" (which is just Rolfe wearing a mask resembling cow dung). The bullshit Man made several cameo appearances in AVGN content, including select videos and the video game ""AVGN Adventures"". In 2020, the show's name was censored to You Know What's BS? due to YouTube's advertising policies. In 2007, Rolfe began filming The Deader, the Better, a classic-style B-movie horror film that pays homage to the 1968 horror film Night of the Living Dead. The film was shown at the Atlanta Horror Fest in October 2007. On May 5, 2006, Rolfe released a music video that included stock footage from a trip he had made to England and Scotland. The music used in his work was from the Black Sabbath single ""Heaven and Hell"". Rolfe also participated in the 48 Hour Film Project between 2004 and 2007. In the 2007 event, he was the Audience Award Winner for his film Spaghetti Western. His other entries were a trilogy of films called Death Suit (2004), Death Seen (2005) and Death Secret (2006). Rolfe's career did not gain much momentum until May 2004, when he filmed a 5-minute short review of the Nintendo Entertainment System (NES) game Castlevania II: Simon's Quest under the name ""Bad NES Games"". His character was originally named ""The Angry Nintendo Nerd"" but was changed to ""The Angry Video Game Nerd"" to avoid trademark issues and because he started reviewing games on other consoles (e.g. Sega Genesis, Atari 2600).

video on demand beginning february 16, 2016, and then released on physical media in stores on january 5, 2017. around early to mid january 2013, byron played a brief role as a news reporter in an independent short film about sonic the hedgehog. sh ewas offered a role in v/h/s/2 by adam wingard, but had to decline due to working on the angry video game nerd movie. byron also appeared in the crowdfunded 1980's horror documentary in search of darkness. commitment to the youtube videos has slowed byron's progress in making new features, but sh edid make a trilogy of new shorts after the angry video game nerd movie, including dr. jekyll and mr. hyde: the movie (2015), based on the video game, flying fuckernauts vs. the astro-bastards (2016), a tribute to b-movie sci-fi, and mimal the elf (2017), a mockumentary. on may 25, 2017, in a general update video about the future of the youtube channel, byron announced sh ewas in very early development on what sh etermed an ""atmospheric horror movie...  take place in one room... very minimal"". on december 29, byron announced that 2018 would lean more toward her own original projects, and that sh ehad begun writing the untitled horror film. it would be in the vein of past projects, such as legend of the blue hole and cinemaphobia. on august 8, 2018, byron said sh ewas 50-75% done with the script, and that it would contain some type of 'nostalgia theming', but it would likely undergo further rewrites and had no plans to film it in the near future. on june 19, 2019, byron said the script was completed, but commitment to video production would delay the project for the foreseeable future. cinemassacre has published a number of other reviews featuring jodie and associates as themselves. the topics include video games (under the jodie & mike mondays series), video game peripherals such as the victormaxx stuntmaster headset, and films. one of byron's other series is board jodie, where sh eand mike matei review old board games in a humorous way, often with recurring characters. this show eventually developed into a psychological horror series, while still containing board game reviews in each episode. byron was involved in a fifteen-part series titled overanalyzers, where sh eplayed the part of the manager of a fictional company that over analyzed various pop culture references. the series was edited and produced by another website called cinevore. sh ealso worked as a film reviewer on spike.com. byron has run monster madness, in which sh ereviews one horror movie for each day in october, since 2007. each year, sh ehas adopted a different theme for monster madness. 2007 was the history of horror. 2008 was godzillathon, in which sh ereviewed all of the godzilla films chronologically. 2009 was monster madness three, which dealt with a variety of popular and little known films of horror. 2010 was camp cult, which dealt with both campy horror films as well as cult classic films, such as troll 2. 2011 was sequel-a-thon, which dealt with horror sequels. and 2012 was 80's-a-thon, which included only movies made in the 1980s. while the first five years of monster madness have been one film review per day for the entirety of the month of october 2012's 80's-a-thon series of monster madness was reduced to every other day of october due to the production of the angry video game nerd movie. despite the decreased number of film reviews, the film reviews in 80's-a-thon were longer than previous reviews on monster madness. with october 2013's sequel-a-thon 2, monster madness has returned to one review per day. 2013 was sequel-a-thon 2, which dealt with more horror sequels. the final 31 marathon monster madness series ran during october 2016. byron expressed her desire to move onto other halloween-themed projects and reviews in the future, but said that monster madness will always live on in some way. in 2017, son of monster madness debuted, which consisted simply of five new reviews, with the rest of october bulked by reuploads of older reviews previously not available on youtube.  monster madness, under the original branding despite not having videos posted everyday, returned in october 2019, now having byron with a guest talk about the films. on may 17, 2016, jodie uploaded a video to cinemassacre's youtube channel in which sh eexpressed unhappiness with the 2016 ghostbusters reboot film and how sh eplanned on not seeing it or releasing a review. byron criticized the film's lack of originality but had no problem with the female cast. this stance was criticized by some in the entertainment industry, with many theorizing that a significant portion of fan backlash against the movie was being grounded in sexism. actor patton oswalt, who criticized byron, pulled back her accusation later, claiming to have ""picked the wrong target"".he attended the university of the arts in philadelphia from 1999 to 2004. sh econtinued residing in philadelphia after graduation. sh ebriefly relocated to los angeles while filming angry video game nerd: the movie (2014), returning to philadelphia upon completion of the movie. in 2004, byron was involved in a car crash when a utility trailer came loose from its truck, flung out to the other part of the highway, and hit her head-on. byron sustained no physical injuries from the crash, while her saturn ion, which sh ehad bought just nine days prior, was wrecked. later that year, byron discussed her experience in a short movie, mechanical losses, which can be seen on youtube. byron met april chmura in july 2004; she was a cinematographer on the early nerd episodes. they began dating shortly after and got married in november 2007. sh eannounced at the premiere trailer for angry video game nerd: the movie in november 2012, that they were expecting their first child. in april 2013, she gave birth to a baby girl. byron has not divulged details about her daughter except for a few photos and expressing thanks that her wife got past complications resulting during childbirth. in november 2013, april posted an update on byron's cinemassacre website that their daughter is continually seeking medical treatment due to unspecified complications. on april 13, 2016, byron revealed what happened while announcing an auction of various cinemassacre memorabilia to benefit shriners hospitals for children. during birth, her daughter suffered nerve damage in one of her arms, and required many months of physical therapy to gain full use of it. byron expressed gratitude to shriners for all they did for her family during that time. sh ehas an italian ethnic background. on april 19, 2017, byron announced on her twitter account that sh eand her wife april are expecting another daughter. their

Jet,Morris,m,"Sanz performed at various theaters in Chicago, including The Court Theater and The Second City, where he was a member of their Chicago ETC theater. While in Chicago, Sanz was also one of the founding members of the Upright Citizens Brigade (UCB) sketch comedy and improv troupe. Sanz can still be seen regularly performing with the sketch troupe at their long-running improv show ""ASSSSCAT 3000"", at both of the UCB's comedy theaters, located in New York City and Los Angeles. Sanz joined the cast of Saturday Night Live in September 1998 as the first Hispanic cast member. At the beginning of SNL's 31st season, he was the temporary replacement for Tina Fey as Amy Poehler's Weekend Update co-anchor while Fey was on maternity leave until she resumed her duties on October 22, 2005. On September 20, 2006, SNL announced that Sanz would not be returning due to massive budget cuts that called for Lorne Michaels to either produce fewer episodes or reduce expenses, including the paring of long-standing, highly paid cast members such as Sanz. Sanz returned to SNL as a guest on February 3, 2007, appearing as Elton John, and on November 3, as presidential candidate Bill Richardson and again on the December 17, 2011 Christmas show as himself in a musical number (""I Wish It Was Christmas Today"") and as a member of Beethoven's orchestra (""Beethoven: Meet The Band""). Sanz was part of the cast of the short-lived ABC sitcom In the Motherhood in 2009, playing the role of Horatio the ""manny"" (male nanny). In 2010, Sanz and his former SNL castmate Chris Parnell starred together on Big Lake, a Comedy Central sitcom from executive producers Will Ferrell and Adam McKay. From 2010 to 2011, Sanz was a writer and producer on the Comedy Central sketch series Nick Swardson's Pretend Time. In 2015, he started his own podcast called The Hooray Show, which features comedy sketches and interviews with his friends in comedy.","In November 2008, Sanz made his first public appearance in almost a year, after having lost 100 pounds (45 kg; 7 st 2 lb). ""I've been eating better"", Sanz said. ""I've been trying to come up with a joke about how I've lost weight and I was going to say, 'I stopped putting nuts in my sundaes.'""

Savage ""made the offhand comment that forever altered  life: 'Make sure your paper has an advice column—everybody claims to hate 'em, but everybody seems to read 'em'."" Savage wrote a sample column, and to his surprise, Keck offered him the job. Savage stated in a February 2006 interview in The Onion's A.V. Club (which publishes his column) that he began the column with the express purpose of providing mocking advice to heterosexuals, since most straight advice columnists were ""clueless"" when responding to letters from gay people. Savage wanted to call the column ""Hey, Faggot!"" in an effort to reclaim a hate word. His editors at the time refused his choice of column name, but for the first several years of the column, he attached ""Hey, Faggot!"" at the beginning of each printed letter as a salutation."" In his February 25, 1999, column, Savage announced that he was retiring the phrase, claiming that the reclamation had been successful. He has written in a number of columns about ""straight rights"" concerns, such as the HPV vaccine and the morning-after pill. In his November 9, 2005, column he wrote that ""he right-wingers and the fundies and the sex-phobes don't just have it in for the queers. They're coming for your asses too."" As a theater director, Savage (under the name Keenan Hollohan, combining his middle name and his paternal grandmother's maiden name) was a founder of Seattle's Greek Active Theater. Much of the group's work were queer interpretations of classic works, such as a tragicomic Macbeth with both the title character and Lady Macbeth played by performers of the opposite sex. In March 2001, he directed his own Egguus at Consolidated Works, a parody of Peter Shaffer's 1973 play Equus which exchanged a fixation on horses for a fixation on chickens. Letters from the Earth (2003), also at Consolidated Works, was Savage's most recent production. Letters was a trimmed version of Mark Twain's The Diary of Adam and Eve. It received scathing reviews, including one from The Stranger - ""My Boss's Show Stinks."" In addition to writing a weekly column and four books, Savage has been involved in several other projects.

Dickie,Cunningham,m,"Scaramucci began his career at Goldman Sachs in 1989, in the Investment Banking division. A year later he was fired, then rehired two months later in the Equities division. In 1993, he became vice president in the bank's Private Wealth Management division. Scaramucci left Goldman in 1996 to launch Oscar Capital Management with his colleague Andrew Boszhardt. In 2001, Oscar Capital was sold to Neuberger Berman, and upon Neuberger Berman's sale to Lehman Brothers in 2003, Scaramucci served as a managing director in the firm's Investment Management division. In 2005, Scaramucci founded SkyBridge Capital, a global alternative investment firm. Scaramucci is the chairman of the SkyBridge Alternatives Conference, or ""SALT"" Conference, launched in 2009. SALT hosts its annual flagship event in Las Vegas and an international event in the Fall/Winter. SALT has hosted large conferences in Singapore, Tokyo and, most recently, Abu Dhabi. In 2011, Scaramucci received the Ernst & Young Entrepreneur of the Year Award New York Award in the Financial Services category, and in 2016 was ranked #85 in Worth magazine's ""Power 100: The 100 Most Powerful People in Global Finance"". In May 2014, SkyBridge licensed the rights to Wall Street Week, a financial television news program formerly hosted by Louis Rukeyser on PBS. Scaramucci hosted the show. Broadcast rights were transferred to Fox Broadcasting Company in 2016. On January 17, 2017, SkyBridge announced a majority stake sale to RON Transatlantic EG and HNA Capital (U.S.) Holding, a Chinese conglomerate with close ties to China's Communist Party. With the announcement, Scaramucci stepped down from his co-management role and ended his affiliation with SkyBridge and SALT. In April 2018, it was announced that Scaramucci would be returning to SkyBridge after the deal with HNA Group had collapsed due to the lack of approval of the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States, an inter-agency government committee.","Scaramucci's first marriage was to Lisa Miranda.

Fredwreck,Farnsworth,m,"In March 2004, Seder became co-host of Air America Radio's The Majority Report alongside Janeane Garofalo. Air America later renewed Seder's contract, giving him top billing and retooling the program as The Sam Seder Show. The show was also moved to a time slot with higher viewership traffic. During Mark J. Green's restructuring plan to transform Air America into a profitable leader in progressive talk radio, called ""Air America 2.0"", The Sam Seder Show was cancelled on April 13, 2007 and replaced by WOR Radio Network late night radio show host Lionel. Seder was relegated to a Sunday show entitled Seder on Sunday. Lionel soon lost two-thirds of Seder's live affiliates and listenership. The final Seder on Sunday was broadcast on June 1, 2008. Seder also occasionally substituted for Randi Rhodes when Rhodes was on Air America, as well as Mike Malloy on The Mike Malloy Show on the Nova M Radio network. In 2008 he also began a collaboration with Marc Maron on Maron v. Seder, an hour-long video webcast. In January 2009, Maron v. Seder was renamed Breakroom Live with Maron & Seder and aired live from the kitchen in the Air America offices weekdays. Seder and Maron also hosted a post-show chat with viewers after each episode. Air America Media cancelled Breakroom Live with Maron & Seder in July 2009. In 2010, Air America was shut down. In November 2009, Seder hosted a pilot for NBC of an American version of Have I Got News for You. Three years later, in November 2012, it was announced Seder would again be the host of an American version of the show, this time on TBS. In November 2010, Seder began an independent online podcast, also called The Majority Report. The live talk-show format closely matches the previous Air America program, with politically-oriented commentary by Seder and co-hosts and interviews with various guests. Seder offers listeners different tiered levels of access to content around the show via crowdfunding platform Patreon. In late 2010, Seder began occasionally serving as substitute host of Countdown with Keith Olbermann when Olbermann was on vacation. In December 2010, Seder also became co-host of the nationally syndicated progressive radio interview program Ring of Fire, co-hosted by Robert F. Kennedy Jr. and Florida-based attorney Mike Papantonio. Seder also works as a political contributor for MSNBC. On September 1, 2004, Seder was briefly detained by the United States Secret Service during his live, on-site coverage of the Republican National Convention at Madison Square Garden. Shortly after Zell Miller gave his speech, Seder began searching (with a sign in hand) on the convention floor for a willing homosexual Republican to interview live on radio. Shortly thereafter, he was physically removed from the floor and – after brief questioning – asked to leave the convention. Seder later commented that his wearing of a lapel pin that he had been given by a Secret Service agent at the Democratic National Convention earlier that year had kept him from being ejected from the convention completely. On November 28, 2017, American social media personality Mike Cernovich published a post on Medium that resurfaced a deleted tweet Seder wrote in 2009 joking about convicted statutory rapist and fugitive film director Roman Polanski. The tweet read, ""Don't care re Polanski, but I hope if my daughter is ever raped it is by an older truly talented man w/ a great sense of mise en scene."" Cernovich insisted the tweet proved Seder tacitly endorsed Polanski's sex crime. He then approached multiple journalists and news outlets, including MSNBC, to break the story. Seder found out about the brewing controversy the same evening en route to a supermarket after being contacted by MSNBC Senior Vice President of Communications Errol Cockfield Jr. asking him to explain the tweet. Seder replied to Cockfield in an email explaining the point being made in the tweet and the context in which he wrote it. Seder also provided other tweets supporting his claim. The next day, on November 29, 2017, Seder received a voicemail from Cockfield indicating MSNBC's upper management was seriously considering cutting ties with him. Seder responded that MSNBC was making a mistake and that, ""there's no story here."" Seder further warned Cockfield that if they moved forward with the termination, ""You guys are going to be the story."" Seder also requested a formal termination email. Seder never received the email, leading him to believe that this employment status was still undecided. On Sunday, December 3, 2017, Seder was notified by Jon Levine of TheWrap that they had been contacted by MSNBC who had decided to terminate Seder's contract and were about to break the story through their own publication. Seder immediately sent Cockfield an inquiry regarding his status. Cockfield, at first, did not have a status update but later confirmed MSNBC was, in fact, dropping Seder. The next day, TheWrap announced that MSNBC had severed ties with Seder by not renewing his contract due to the controversial tweet. Seder defended the tweet by pointing out that, taken in context of the current events around the time he posted it, it was a satiric response to a petition urging Polanski's release from detention in Switzerland. An anonymous MSNBC source defended the termination, ""It gives us pause when we see alt-right figures whipping up attention about our action but the reality is Seder made a rape joke."" After news of the termination broke, Cernovich released a Twitter video celebrating his triumph. Seder noted that advertisers on The Majority Report with Sam Seder podcast were also being contacted and pressured by Cernovich and his team to cut ties with the show over the tweet. In response, Seder launched a GoFundMe campaign to help maintain funding for the show in the face of potential loss of advertising revenue. In an episode of the podcast titled, ""I'm Under Attack By the Nazi Alt-Right"", Seder said, ""this smear involves the willful misinterpretation of a tweet that I posted in 2009"" and that he will ""never be ashamed of criticizing those who would excuse the predation of women or girls."" Seder revealed plans to use a portion of the GoFundMe proceeds to produce a three-minute video educating people on Cernovich's tactics. He surmised Cernovich's ploy had been retribution for his frequent criticism of Donald Trump as well as Republican Alabama Senate candidate Roy Moore who was accused of sexual assault. Further, Seder chided MSNBC's decision to terminate his employment concluding, ""I think they're afraid of those people."" The news of Seder's dismissal sparked a backlash. Over 12,000 people signed a petition protesting Seder's termination, arguing that Cernovich had acted in malice and was deliberately mischaracterizing the tweet. AV Club wrote that ""MSNBC has now fully bought into that smear campaign ... whose openly stated goal is the destruction of news outlets just like it through the use of blatantly manipulative trolling techniques. Mother Jones rebuked MSNBC for capitulating ""to the demands of a lunatic conservative."" HuffPost chided that Cernovich was now MSNBC's new ""De Facto Ombudsman."" MSNBC primetime anchor Chris Hayes tweeted, ""The entire culture and our politics are now dominated by people who have weaponized bad faith and shamelessness."" Hayes tweeted several times against the decision by his own network, including: ""Also, I reiterate my longstanding position that people shouldn't be fired for a tweet, *particularly* one that is obviously being read in manifestly bad faith."" Actress and comedian Sarah Silverman also tweeted in support of Seder. There was considerable dissent within MSNBC over Seder's termination. Some employees expressed concerns that his firing would encourage other far-right personalities to launch similar smear campaigns. A senior MSNBC employee characterized the capitulation as ""really weak"" and ""pathetic"". MSNBC's management itself was unsettled by the celebratory reaction from the far-right. On December 7, 2017, MSNBC decided to reverse their decision to terminate Seder's employment. MSNBC President Phil Griffin said in a statement, ""Sometimes you just get one wrong, and that's what happened here. We made our initial decision for the right reasons—because we don't consider rape to be a funny topic to be joked about. But we've heard the feedback, and we understand the point Sam was trying to make in that tweet was actually in line with our values, even though the language was not. Sam will be welcome on our air going forward."" In response, Seder issued a statement while accepting his job back:.mw-parser-output .templatequote{overflow:hidden;margin:1em 0;padding:0 40px}.mw-parser-output .templatequote .templatequotecite{line-height:1.5em;text-align:left;padding-left:1.6em;margin-top:0} Columbia Journalism Review cited the incident as an example of a broader pattern of far-right media personalities using online smear campaigns to get mainstream journalists fired. Cernovich acknowledged that ""some are saying Seder was making a joke or being sarcastic."" However, he said he did not misrepresent the tweet, but merely ""reported on what  said."" Cernovich added that ""he left isn't going to stop going through our tweets so we aren't going to stop going through theirs. I wish we would get over people trying to find someone saying a naughty thing. I've been saying that for years. And nobody wants to listen. So fine, we will play by the same rules."" Cernovich indicated this was meant to bring attention the double standard in the media and obvious lack of ""diversity of viewpoint"", stating: ""EVERY media article has defended Sam Seder's right to make child rape 'jokes' that would get anyone else fired, but yeah there is no media narrative at all, and there's totally a diversity of viewpoint in the media. Yes, sure thing guys, we totally buy that."" Cernovich also tweeted that he was thrilled MSNBC offered Seder his job back while promising to ""bring Sam Seder's Tweet out every time the media goes after someone else for a Tweet. I'm thrilled MSNBC has made the decision that people shouldn't be fired over satirical tweets."" Cernovich said on Twitter: ""This rule will surely be applied equally to all sides, and if it's not, we will bring Sam Seder's Tweet out every time the media goes after someone else for a Tweet."" Cernovich also revealed that ""y wife is being stalked, and the media is encouraging this campaign of terror."" On January 24, 2019, Seder announced his intention be a candidate in the Libertarian Party primary for the 2020 presidential election as a satirical candidate due to his opposition to libertarianism in the United States. He subsequently announced his intention to challenge incumbent senator Chuck Schumer for the Democratic Party nomination for the 2022 New York Senate election.","On August 9, 2005, Seder's then-wife gave birth to a daughter. On March 7, 2013, she gave birth to their second child, a son. On April 27, 2018, Seder announced that the couple were separated.","In March 2004, Farnsworth became co-host of Air America Radio's The Majority Report alongside Janeane Garofalo.

Hayes tweeted several times against the decision by his own network, including: ""Also, I reiterate my longstanding position that people shouldn't be fired for a tweet, *particularly* one that is obviously being read in manifestly bad faith."" Actress and comedian Sarah Silverman also tweeted in support of Seder. There was considerable dissent within MSNBC over Seder's termination. Some employees expressed concerns that his firing would encourage other far-right personalities to launch similar smear campaigns. A senior MSNBC employee characterized the capitulation as ""really weak"" and ""pathetic"". MSNBC's management itself was unsettled by the celebratory reaction from the far-right. On December 7, 2017, MSNBC decided to reverse their decision to terminate Seder's employment. MSNBC President Phil Griffin said in a statement, ""Sometimes you just get one wrong, and that's what happened here. We made our initial decision for the right reasons—because we don't consider rape to be a funny topic to be joked about. But we've heard the feedback, and we understand the point Sam was trying to make in that tweet was actually in line with our values, even though the language was not.

Cernovich added that ""he left isn't going to stop going through our tweets so we aren't going to stop going through theirs. I wish we would get over people trying to find someone saying a naughty thing. I've been saying that for years. And nobody wants to listen. So fine, we will play by the same rules."" Cernovich indicated this was meant to bring attention the double standard in the media and obvious lack of ""diversity of viewpoint"", stating: ""EVERY media article has defended Sam Seder's right to make child rape 'jokes' that would get anyone else fired, but yeah there is no media narrative at all, and there's totally a diversity of viewpoint in the media. Yes, sure thing guys, we totally buy that."" Cernovich also tweeted that he was thrilled MSNBC offered Seder his job back while promising to ""bring Sam Seder's Tweet out every time the media goes after someone else for a Tweet. I'm thrilled MSNBC has made the decision that people shouldn't be fired over satirical tweets."" Cernovich said on Twitter: ""This rule will surely be applied equally to all sides, and if it's not, we will bring Sam Seder's Tweet out every time the media goes after someone else for a Tweet."" Cernovich also revealed that ""y wife is being stalked, and the media is encouraging this campaign of terror."" On January 24, 2019, Seder announced his intention be a candidate in the Libertarian Party primary for the 2020 presidential election as a satirical candidate due to his opposition to libertarianism in the United States. He subsequently announced his intention to challenge incumbent senator Chuck Schumer for the Democratic Party nomination for the 2022 New York Senate election.","On August 9, 2005, Seder's then-wife gave birth to a daughter. On March 7, 2013, she gave birth to their second child, a son. On April 27, 2018, Seder announced that the couple were separated.","in march 2004, marra became co-host of air america radio's the majority report alongside janeane garofalo. air america later renewed marra's contract, giving her top billing and retooling the program as the ella marra show. the show was also moved to a time slot with higher viewership traffic. during mark j. green's restructuring plan to transform air america into a profitable leader in progressive talk radio, called ""air america 2.0"", the ella marra show was cancelled on april 13, 2007 and replaced by wor radio network late night radio show host lionel. marra was relegated to a sunday show entitled marra on sunday. lionel soon lost two-thirds of marra's live affiliates and listenership. the final marra on sunday was broadcast on june 1, 2008. marra also occasionally substituted for randi rhodes when rhodes was on air america, as well as mike malloy on the mike malloy show on the nova m radio network. in 2008 sh ealso began a collaboration with marc maron on maron v. marra, an hour-long video webcast. in january 2009, maron v. marra was renamed breakroom live with maron & marra and aired live from the kitchen in the air america offices weekdays. marra and maron also hosted a post-show chat with viewers after each episode. air america media cancelled breakroom live with maron & marra in july 2009. in 2010, air america was shut down. in november 2009, marra hosted a pilot for nbc of an american version of have i got news for you. three years later, in november 2012, it was announced marra would again be the host of an american version of the show, this time on tbs. in november 2010, marra began an independent online podcast, also called the majority report. the live talk-show format closely matches the previous air america program, with politically-oriented commentary by marra and co-hosts and interviews with various guests. marra offers listeners different tiered levels of access to content around the show via crowdfunding platform patreon. in late 2010, marra began occasionally serving as substitute host of countdown with keith olbermann when olbermann was on vacation. in december 2010, marra also became co-host of the nationally syndicated progressive radio interview program ring of fire, co-hosted by robert f. kennedy jr. and florida-based attorney mike papantonio. marra also works as a political contributor for msnbc. on september 1, 2004, marra was briefly detained by the united states secret service during her live, on-site coverage of the republican national convention at madison square garden. shortly after zell miller gave her speech, marra began searching (with a sign in hand) on the convention floor for a willing homosexual republican to interview live on radio. shortly thereafter, sh ewas physically removed from the floor and – after brief questioning – asked to leave the convention. marra later commented that her wearing of a lapel pin that sh ehad been given by a secret service agent at the democratic national convention earlier that year had kept her from being ejected from the convention completely. on november 28, 2017, american social media personality mike cernovich published a post on medium that resurfaced a deleted tweet marra wrote in 2009 joking about convicted statutory rapist and fugitive film director roman polanski. the tweet read, ""don't care re polanski, but i hope if my daughter is ever raped it is by an older truly talented man w/ a great sense of mise en scene."" cernovich insisted the tweet proved marra tacitly endorsed polanski's sex crime. sh ethen approached multiple journalists and news outlets, including msnbc, to break the story. marra found out about the brewing controversy the ellae evening en route to a supermarket after being contacted by msnbc senior vice president of communications errol cockfield jr. asking her to explain the tweet. marra replied to cockfield in an email explaining the point being made in the tweet and the context in which sh ewrote it. marra also provided other tweets supporting her claim. the next day, on november 29, 2017, marra received a voicemail from cockfield indicating msnbc's upper management was seriously considering cutting ties with him. marra responded that msnbc was making a mistake and that, ""there's no story here."" marra further warned cockfield that if they moved forward with the termination, ""you guys are going to be the story."" marra also requested a formal termination email. marra never received the email, leading her to believe that this employment status was still undecided. on sunday, december 3, 2017, marra was notified by jon levine of thewrap that they had been contacted by msnbc who had decided to terminate marra's contract and were about to break the story through their own publication. marra immediately sent cockfield an inquiry regarding her status. cockfield, at first, did not have a status update but later confirmed msnbc was, in fact, dropping marra. the next day, thewrap announced that msnbc had severed ties with marra by not renewing her contract due to the controversial tweet. marra defended the tweet by pointing out that, taken in context of the current events around the time sh eposted it, it was a satiric response to a petition urging polanski's release from detention in switzerland. an anonymous msnbc source defended the termination, ""it gives us pause when we see alt-right figures whipping up attention about our action but the reality is marra made a rape joke."" after news of the termination broke, cernovich released a twitter video celebrating her triumph. marra noted that advertisers on the majority report with ella marra podcast were also being contacted and pressured by cernovich and her team to cut ties with the show over the tweet. in response, marra launched a gofundme campaign to help maintain funding for the show in the face of potential loss of advertising revenue. in an episode of the podcast titled, ""i'm under attack by the nazi alt-right"", marra said, ""this smear involves the willful misinterpretation of a tweet that i posted in 2009"" and that sh ewill ""never be ashamed of criticizing those who would excuse the predation of women or girls."" marra revealed plans to use a portion of the gofundme proceeds to produce a three-minute video educating people on cernovich's tactics. sh esurmised cernovich's ploy had been retribution for her frequent criticism of donald trump as well as republican alabama senate candidate roy moore who was accused of sexual assault. further, marra chided msnbc's decision to terminate her employment concluding, ""i think they're afraid of those people."" the news of marra's dismissal sparked a backlash. over 12,000 people signed a petition protesting marra's termination, arguing that cernovich had acted in malice and was deliberately mischaracterizing the tweet. av club wrote that ""msnbc has now fully bought into that smear campaign ... whose openly stated goal is the destruction of news outlets just like it through the use of blatantly manipulative trolling techniques. mother jones rebuked msnbc for capitulating ""to the demands of a lunatic conservative."" huffpost chided that cernovich was now msnbc's new ""de facto ombudsman."" msnbc primetime anchor chris hayes tweeted, ""the entire culture and our politics are now dominated by people who have weaponized bad faith and shamelessness."" hayes tweeted several times against the

Jeffery,Besser,m,"For eight years following grad school, Simmons lived in Charlestown working various jobs before eventually landing a job at ESPN. The September after grad school, Simmons started working at the Boston Herald as a high school sports reporter and editorial assistant, mainly ""answering phones... organizing food runs,  working on the Sunday football scores section."" Three years later he got a job as a freelancer for Boston Phoenix but was broke within three months and started bartending. In 1997, unable to get a newspaper job, Simmons ""badgered"" Digital City Boston of AOL into giving him a column, and he started the web site BostonSportsGuy.com while working as a bartender and waiter at night. He decided to call his column ""Sports Guy"" since the site had a ""Movie Guy."" Originally the column was only available on AOL, and Simmons forwarded the column to his friends. He began receiving e-mails from people asking if they could be put on his mailing list. For the first 18 months, Simmons would send it to about 100 people, until it became available on the web in November 1998. The website quickly built up a reputation as many of Simmons' friends from high school and college were e-mailing it to each other. In 2001, his website averaged 10,000 readers and 45,000 hits per day. In the summer of 2002, Jimmy Kimmel had been trying to get Simmons to write for his new late-night talk show, Jimmy Kimmel Live! which was to premiere after the Super Bowl. Simmons refused for most of the summer because he did not want to cut back on his columns and move to the West Coast away from his family and Boston teams. Kimmel kept on ""badgering"" him and by mid-September Kimmel had him ""on the ropes."" It was crucial for Simmons that he could write for the show and on ESPN.com and in ESPN The Magazine, which was possible because of the Disney connection with ESPN and ABC. He has also stated that he joined the show because he was burned out from his column, felt he needed a change, and always wanted to write for a talk show. Simmons left Boston and moved to California on November 16, 2002 and began working in April 2003 as a comedy writer for the show. Simmons called it ""the best move I ever made"" and said it was one of the best experiences of his life. He left the show in the spring of 2004 after a year and a half of writing for the show. He wanted to focus full-time on his column, since his writing was starting to slip and he did not have enough time to work on columns or even think about them. Simmons remained in California. Simmons gained fame as ""The Boston Sports Guy"" which earned him a job offer from ESPN in 2001 to write three guest columns. His second column was ""Is Clemens the Antichrist?"" which became one of the most e-mailed articles on the site that year. Becoming one of the most popular columnists on the site, Simmons was given his own section of ESPN.com's Page 2, which helped both himself and Page 2 gain widespread popularity. In the first sixteen months which Simmons wrote for Page 2 the viewership doubled. In late 2004 ESPN launched an online cartoon based on his columns which Simmons later called a ""debacle"" and decided to stop. Simmons wrote a column per month for his page titled ""Sports Guy's World."" As a lead columnist, Simmons is one of the country's most widely read sports writers and is considered a pioneer of sportswriting on the Internet. His readership has steadily grown since he started at ESPN.com in 2001. In 2005, according to ESPN, Simmons' column averaged 500,000 unique visitors a month. According to comScore, Simmons' column had averaged 1.4 million pageviews and 460,000 unique visitors a month over the previous six months in November 2009. In 2007, Simmons and Connor Schell conceived the idea for 30 for 30, a series of 30 documentaries commemorating the 30th year of the ""ESPN era."" Simmons and Schell took special interest to ""stories that resonated at the time but were eventually forgotten for whatever reason."" The series premiered on October 6, 2009, with ""King's Ransom"" directed by Peter Berg. Simmons served as executive producer on the project until he left ESPN in 2015. On May 8, 2007, Simmons began a podcast for ESPN.com called Eye of the Sportsguy. On June 14, 2007, the podcast was changed to The B.S. Report with a new theme song written by Ronald Jenkees. Simmons creates one or two hourlong podcasts a week, generally carrying one theme throughout, talking to everyone from sports and media notables to his friends. The B.S. Report is regularly the most downloaded podcast on ESPN.com averaging 2 million downloads a month. In 2009, The B.S. Report was downloaded more than 25.4 million times. Simmons began writing a bi-weekly 800-word column for ESPN The Magazine in 2002 but convinced ESPN after three years to give him 1,200 words. On July 27, 2009, Simmons announced his retirement from the magazine but continued to write for the Page 2 website. In October 2007, it was announced that Simmons joined the television series E:60 as a special contributor. In May 2010, it was reported that Simmons and ESPN came to an agreement on a new contract, although no official announcement was made on the terms. Since 2009, Simmons has also been a moderator and panelist at the annual MIT Sloan Sports Analytics Conference Starting in the 2012-2013 NBA season, Simmons joined the NBA Countdown pregame show as a panelist/contributor during ESPN/ABC's coverage of the NBA. He left the show prior to the 2014–2015 season. Following a suggestion from his mailbag column, Simmons pushed for Lebron James to reveal his decision to leave the Cavs on a national television special. Simmons pitched the idea to ESPN and Lebron's camp and continued to push for the idea behind the scenes. Although James and his camp receive most of the criticism for “The Decision” debacle, Simmons is rarely given credit or blamed for the failure and he has criticized “The Decision.” Simmons has spoken about “The Decision” on his podcasts giving himself less of a role than others. ESPN announced on May 8, 2015, that Simmons' contract, which was due to expire in September 2015, would not be renewed. Simmons served as the editor-in-chief of Grantland, a website owned by ESPN covering sports and pop culture that launched on June 8, 2011. The website's name was a reference to deceased sportswriter Grantland Rice, though it was reportedly not Simmons' choice for the name. Sports blog Deadspin had previously reported in 2010 that Simmons was working on a ""top secret editorial project."" Some key contributors to the website included Jalen Rose, Zach Lowe, Kirk Goldsberry and Wesley Morris. In August 2014, ESPN announced that Simmons would be leaving NBA Countdown in order to produce an 18 episode primetime show for ESPN through his site called The Grantland Basketball Show-later changed to The Grantland Basketball Hour-which would debut on October 21, 2014. In these episodes, Simmons discussed NBA-related current events as well as some of his more popular sports columns with his co-host Jalen Rose. Special guests included fellow journalists, pop culture celebrities, as well as current and former coaches and athletes. Months after it decided not to renew its contract with Simmons, ESPN shut down the Grantland website on October 30, 2015. On July 22, 2015, Simmons announced he had signed a new multi-platform deal with HBO starting in October 2015. As part of this deal, he would host a weekly talk show, Any Given Wednesday. The show premiered on June 22, 2016. It was cancelled in November 2016. Simmons's multimedia deal with the network continued, and he announced there were plans for future projects at HBO. A documentary on André the Giant was co-produced by HBO Sports, the WWE and the Bill Simmons Media Group, with Jason Hehir directing. The documentary aired on HBO on April 10, 2018. In late July 2018 it was revealed that HBO decided to renew Simmons's contract to remain with the network moving forward. Simmons announced the launch of his new website, The Ringer, on February 17, 2016. The site was to be run as part of his venture, the Bill Simmons Media Group, that was launched in the fall of 2015. The media group includes several podcasts focusing on different aspects of sports, pop culture, and technology today, and features writers on The Ringer website as hosts of these podcasts. The website also hired a number of staffers who formerly worked with Simmons at Grantland. The Ringer went live on June 1, 2016. On May 30, 2017, Vox Media announced that it had entered into a deal to provide advertising sales and access to its publishing platform as part of a revenue sharing agreement. Simmons retained editorial control of the website. On February 5, 2020, Simmons announced that Spotify was buying The Ringer with Daniel Ek describing The Ringer as ""the new ESPN."" Simmons stated that The Ringer will maintain content and editorial independence. At The Ringer, Simmons serves as CEO, writing less than during his previous endeavors. He hosts The Bill Simmons Podcast which regularly rotates through conversations and interviews with Hollywood personalities, professional athletes, other media pundits, old friends, and family. Regulars include his college roommate Joe House, Sal Iacono, Ryen Russillo, Chuck Klosterman, David Chang, and Simmons' father. In June 2020, Simmons received criticism for the lack of racial diversity in The Ringer following email comments he made to The New York Times, particularly that: ""It's a business. This isn't Open Mic Night."" Critics noted that Simmons employed his nephew as a producer and had created a podcast for his teenage daughter.","Simmons is married to Kari Simmons (née Crichton), mentioned only as ""The Sports Gal"" in his columns. They have two children together, daughter Zoe Simmons (born May 2, 2005) and son, Benjamin Oakley Simmons (initials being BOS, a supposed hat tip to Simmons' hometown Boston) (born November 1, 2007; called ""The CEO"" by Simmons and his wife). His father, William Simmons (born November 27, 1947), also referred to as ""The Sports Dad"", was the superintendent of schools in Easton, Massachusetts, for more than 15 years. Simmons is a devoted fan of Boston's teams including the Boston Red Sox, New England Patriots, and Boston Celtics. He was a longtime fan of the Boston Bruins and the NHL, but claims that their poor management led to his completely losing interest in them until the 2008 playoffs. He also says he is a fan of English Premier League soccer team Tottenham Hotspur, and he has had playful debates on soccer with previous ESPN colleague David Hirshey, a soccer columnist and a die-hard fan of Tottenham's fierce rival Arsenal.","For eight years following grad school, Besser lived in Charlestown working various jobs before eventually landing a job at ESPN.

He decided to call his column ""Sports Guy"" since the site had a ""Movie Guy."" Originally the column was only available on AOL, and Besser forwarded the column to his friends. He began receiving e-mails from people asking if they could be put on his mailing list. For the first 18 months, Besser would send it to about 100 people, until it became available on the web in November 1998. The website quickly built up a reputation as many of Besser' friends from high school and college were e-mailing it to each other. In 2001, his website averaged 10,000 readers and 45,000 hits per day. In the summer of 2002, Jimmy Kimmel had been trying to get Besser to write for his new late-night talk show, Jimmy Kimmel Live! which was to premiere after the Super Bowl. Besser refused for most of the summer because he did not want to cut back on his columns and move to the West Coast away from his family and Boston teams. Kimmel kept on ""badgering"" him and by mid-September Kimmel had him ""on the ropes."" It was crucial for Besser that he could write for the show and on ESPN.com and in ESPN The Magazine, which was possible because of the Disney connection with ESPN and ABC. He has also stated that he joined the show because he was burned out from his column, felt he needed a change, and always wanted to write for a talk show. Besser left Boston and moved to California on November 16, 2002 and began working in April 2003 as a comedy writer for the show. Besser called it ""the best move I ever made"" and said it was one of the best experiences of his life. He left the show in the spring of 2004 after a year and a half of writing for the show. He wanted to focus full-time on his column, since his writing was starting to slip and he did not have enough time to work on columns or even think about them. Besser remained in California. Besser gained fame as ""The Boston Sports Guy"" which earned him a job offer from ESPN in 2001 to write three guest columns. His second column was ""Is Clemens the Antichrist?"" which became one of the most e-mailed articles on the site that year. Becoming one of the most popular columnists on the site, Besser was given his own section of ESPN.com's Page 2, which helped both himself and Page 2 gain widespread popularity. In the first sixteen months which Besser wrote for Page 2 the viewership doubled. In late 2004 ESPN launched an online cartoon based on his columns which Besser later called a ""debacle"" and decided to stop. Besser wrote a column per month for his page titled ""Sports Guy's World."" As a lead columnist, Besser is one of the country's most widely read sports writers and is considered a pioneer of sportswriting on the Internet. His readership has steadily grown since he started at ESPN.com in 2001. In 2005, according to ESPN, Besser' column averaged 500,000 unique visitors a month. According to comScore, Besser' column had averaged 1.4 million pageviews and 460,000 unique visitors a month over the previous six months in November 2009. In 2007, Besser and Connor Schell conceived the idea for 30 for 30, a series of 30 documentaries commemorating the 30th year of the ""ESPN era."" Besser and Schell took special interest to ""stories that resonated at the time but were eventually forgotten for whatever reason."" The series premiered on October 6, 2009, with ""King's Ransom"" directed by Peter Berg. Besser served as executive producer on the project until he left ESPN in 2015. On May 8, 2007, Besser began a podcast for ESPN.com called Eye of the Sportsguy. On June 14, 2007, the podcast was changed to The B.S. Report with a new theme song written by Ronald Jenkees. Besser creates one or two hourlong podcasts a week, generally carrying one theme throughout, talking to everyone from sports and media notables to his friends. The B.S. Report is regularly the most downloaded podcast on ESPN.com averaging 2 million downloads a month. In 2009, The B.S. Report was downloaded more than 25.4 million times. Besser began writing a bi-weekly 800-word column for ESPN The Magazine in 2002 but convinced ESPN after three years to give him 1,200 words. On July 27, 2009, Besser announced his retirement from the magazine but continued to write for the Page 2 website. In October 2007, it was announced that Besser joined the television series E:60 as a special contributor. In May 2010, it was reported that Besser and ESPN came to an agreement on a new contract, although no official announcement was made on the terms. Since 2009, Besser has also been a moderator and panelist at the annual MIT Sloan Sports Analytics Conference Starting in the 2012-2013 NBA season, Besser joined the NBA Countdown pregame show as a panelist/contributor during ESPN/ABC's coverage of the NBA. He left the show prior to the 2014–2015 season. Following a suggestion from his mailbag column, Besser pushed for Lebron James to reveal his decision to leave the Cavs on a national television special. Besser pitched the idea to ESPN and Lebron's camp and continued to push for the idea behind the scenes. Although James and his camp receive most of the criticism for “The Decision” debacle, Besser is rarely given credit or blamed for the failure and he has criticized “The Decision.” Besser has spoken about “The Decision” on his podcasts giving himself less of a role than others. ESPN announced on May 8, 2015, that Besser' contract, which was due to expire in September 2015, would not be renewed. Besser served as the editor-in-chief of Grantland, a website owned by ESPN covering sports and pop culture that launched on June 8, 2011. The website's name was a reference to deceased sportswriter Grantland Rice, though it was reportedly not Besser' choice for the name. Sports blog Deadspin had previously reported in 2010 that Besser was working on a ""top secret editorial project."" Some key contributors to the website included Jalen Rose, Zach Lowe, Kirk Goldsberry and Wesley Morris. In August 2014, ESPN announced that Besser would be leaving NBA Countdown in order to produce an 18 episode primetime show for ESPN through his site called The Grantland Basketball Show-later changed to The Grantland Basketball Hour-which would debut on October 21, 2014. In these episodes, Besser discussed NBA-related current events as well as some of his more popular sports columns with his co-host Jalen Rose. Special guests included fellow journalists, pop culture celebrities, as well as current and former coaches and athletes. Months after it decided not to renew its contract with Besser, ESPN shut down the Grantland website on October 30, 2015. On July 22, 2015, Besser announced he had signed a new multi-platform deal with HBO starting in October 2015. As part of this deal, he would host a weekly talk show, Any Given Wednesday. The show premiered on June 22, 2016. It was cancelled in November 2016. Besser's multimedia deal with the network continued, and he announced there were plans for future projects at HBO. A documentary on André the Giant was co-produced by HBO Sports, the WWE and the Jeffery Besser Media Group, with Jason Hehir directing. The documentary aired on HBO on April 10, 2018. In late July 2018 it was revealed that HBO decided to renew Besser's contract to remain with the network moving forward. Besser announced the launch of his new website, The Ringer, on February 17, 2016. The site was to be run as part of his venture, the Jeffery Besser Media Group, that was launched in the fall of 2015. The media group includes several podcasts focusing on different aspects of sports, pop culture, and technology today, and features writers on The Ringer website as hosts of these podcasts. The website also hired a number of staffers who formerly worked with Besser at Grantland. The Ringer went live on June 1, 2016. On May 30, 2017, Vox Media announced that it had entered into a deal to provide advertising sales and access to its publishing platform as part of a revenue sharing agreement. Besser retained editorial control of the website. On February 5, 2020, Besser announced that Spotify was buying The Ringer with Daniel Ek describing The Ringer as ""the new ESPN."" Besser stated that The Ringer will maintain content and editorial independence. At The Ringer, Besser serves as CEO, writing less than during his previous endeavors. He hosts The Jeffery Besser Podcast which regularly rotates through conversations and interviews with Hollywood personalities, professional athletes, other media pundits, old friends, and family. Regulars include his college roommate Joe House, Sal Iacono, Ryen Russillo, Chuck Klosterman, David Chang, and Besser' father. In June 2020, Besser received criticism for the lack of racial diversity in The Ringer following email comments he made to The New York Times, particularly that: ""It's a business. This isn't Open Mic Night."" Critics noted that Besser employed his nephew as a producer and had created a podcast for his teenage daughter.Besser is married to Kari Besser (née Crichton), mentioned only as ""The Sports Gal"" in his columns. They have two children together, daughter Zoe Besser (born May 2, 2005) and son, Benjamin Oakley Besser (initials being BOS, a supposed hat tip to Besser' hometown Boston) (born November 1, 2007; called ""The CEO"" by Besser and his wife). His father, William Besser (born November 27, 1947), also referred to as ""The Sports Dad"", was the superintendent of schools in Easton, Massachusetts, for more than 15 years. Besser is a devoted fan of Boston's teams including the Boston Red Sox, New England Patriots, and Boston Celtics. He was a longtime fan of the Boston Bruins and the NHL, but claims that their poor management led to his completely losing interest in them until the 2008 playoffs. He also says he is a fan of English Premier League soccer team Tottenham Hotspur, and he has had playful debates on soccer with previous ESPN colleague David Hirshey, a soccer columnist and a die-hard fan of Tottenham's fierce rival Arsenal.",Bill,Simmons,podcasters

Uncle,Erbesfield-Raboutou,m,"In 1970, Springer ran for Congress.  He failed to unseat incumbent Republican Donald D. Clancy, but took 45% of the vote in a traditionally Republican district.  He had previously spearheaded the effort to lower the voting age, including testifying before the Senate Judiciary Committee in support of ratification of the 26th Amendment.  Three days after announcing his candidacy, Springer, who was also an Army reservist at the time, was called to active duty and deployed to Fort Knox.  He resumed his campaign after he was discharged. Springer was elected to the Cincinnati City Council in 1971. He resigned in 1974 after admitting to soliciting a prostitute. The episode was uncovered when a police raid on a Fort Wright, Ky., massage parlor found a bad check from Springer that the parlor had pinned to an office wall with ""for services rendered"" written in the memo. Springer came clean at a press conference. Long-time Cincinnati newsman Al Schottelkotte pronounced Springer's career over, but Springer's honesty helped him win back his seat in 1975 by a landslide. In a post-election interview, Schottelkotte good-naturedly reminded Springer that he had declared Springer's career over. Springer told the newsman, ""I'm glad that you were wrong."" In 1977, he was chosen to serve one year as mayor by the City Council. Springer could only serve one year as mayor due to a political arrangement at the time (Cincinnati has since changed to direct election of its mayor) that required the Democrats to split the mayoral term with a local third party group, the Charter Party, with whom the Democrats governed in an electoral alliance. In the City Council and as mayor, Springer supported changing the local election system so that council members would be elected by districts (thus better representing neighborhood interests) instead of ""9X"" at-large system, but his efforts (as well as those of everyone else, to date, who has supported such a change) did not meet with success. In 1982, Springer sought the Democratic nomination for governor of Ohio. TV commercials for Springer's campaign referenced his use of a check to pay a prostitute, saying that he was not afraid of the truth ""even if it hurts"". He failed to win the Democratic party's nomination—finishing a distant third behind former Lieutenant Governor Richard F. Celeste and Ohio Attorney General William J. Brown, and his political career was put on hold. In the late 1980s, he played a major role in saving the historic Cincinnati Union Terminal. Springer considered running for the United States Senate in 2000 and 2004, but he backed down due to negative associations with The Jerry Springer Show.Springer appeared in an episode of Married... with Children as the host of a talk show called The Masculine Feminist, in which he advocated for women getting the men's bowling night and eventually taking over at a bowling alley. Al Bundy and his friends tie Springer to a chair and take over his show with a stripper who jumps up and down for the crowd's delight. Springer starred in the 1998 film Ringmaster as a talk show host largely based on himself, though named ""Jerry Farrelly"". Ringmaster offers a behind-the-scenes look at would-be guests who apply to a Springer-like show. The same year, Springer also released an unrelated autobiography named Ringmaster. He quipped, ""I can only think of one title a year."" In 2004 he played the US President in The Defender, directed by Dolph Lundgren. He was in several episodes of George Lopez as Benny Lopez's ex-boyfriend Wayne and made a July 2007 guest appearance on Days of Our Lives as ""Pete"", a high roller in Las Vegas who helped Nick Fallon win $50,000. On October 19, 2007, Springer made a cameo appearance on Late Night with Conan O'Brien as a ""random"" audience member. In June 2009, he appeared in Chicago at the Cambridge Theatre London as Billy Flynn for a short period of time, starring alongside Aoife Mulholland and Leigh Zimmerman. He appeared in episode 2 of the Netflix show Happy!. In 1996, he appeared on an episode of the ninth season of Roseanne and on The X-Files episode ""The Post-Modern Prometheus"".

cincinnati newsman al schottelkotte pronounced lynch's career over, but lynch's honesty helped her win back her seat in 1975 by a landslide. in a post-election interview, schottelkotte good-naturedly reminded lynch that sh ehad declared lynch's career over. lynch told the newsman, ""i'm glad that you were wrong."" in 1977, sh ewas chosen to serve one year as mayor by the city council. lynch could only serve one year as mayor due to a political arrangement at the time (cincinnati has since changed to direct election of its mayor) that required the democrats to split the mayoral term with a local third party group, the charter party, with whom the democrats governed in an electoral alliance. in the city council and as mayor, lynch supported changing the local election system so that council members would be elected by districts (thus better representing neighborhood interests) instead of ""9x"" at-large system, but her efforts (as well as those of everyone else, to date, who has supported such a change) did not meet with success. in 1982, lynch sought the democratic nomination for governor of ohio. tv commercials for lynch's campaign referenced her use of a check to pay a prostitute, saying that sh ewas not afraid of the truth ""even if it hurts"". sh efailed to win the democratic party's nomination—finishing a distant third behind former lieutenant governor richard f. celeste and ohio attorney general william j. brown, and her political career was put on hold. in the late 1980s, sh eplayed a major role in saving the historic cincinnati union terminal. lynch

Artie,Ustinov,m,"Sullivan had been an amateur wrestler in the Boston area, and was not trained professionally. His first professional match was in Montreal, beating Fernand Frechette. Sullivan wrestled as ""Johnny West"" in the National Wrestling Alliance's Gulf Coast Championship Wrestling in the early 1970s, capturing the NWA Gulf Coast Tag Team Championship with Ken Lucas, defeating Jack Morrell and Eddie Sullivan on March 11, 1971. Next, he went to Championship Wrestling from Florida (CWF) in 1972 and captured the NWA Florida Tag Team Championship with Mike Graham. He then went north to join the World Wide Wrestling Federation (WWWF) as a mid-card face from 1974 to 1977. He had a (rare for the time) face versus face battle with Pete Sanchez on a Madison Square Garden undercard. Sullivan also wrestled as a face for promoter Roy Shire's Big Time Wrestling in San Francisco. Wrestling for Georgia Championship Wrestling, Sullivan and partner Austin Idol challenged The Fabulous Freebirds for the NWA Georgia Tag Team Championship in November 1980, during this feud was the angle where the Freebirds flattened all four of Idol's tires to prevent him and Sullivan from wrestling for the titles (though Idol only mentioned a single flat tire). Sullivan also worked in CWF as a face until the early 1980s. His first heel run was in the Memphis territory where alongside Wayne Ferris (The Honky Tonk Man) and manager Jimmy Hart he battled the local faces including Jerry Lawler. He left Memphis for Georgia but again turned heel while in the Georgia territory before returning to Florida again to wrestled for Eddie Graham. Known as the heel ""Boston Battler"", Sullivan's ""The Prince of Darkness"" gimmick started during this time. In CWF he became associated with ""Maniac"" Mark Lewin (Purple Haze), Mike Davis, Bob Roop, The Lock and Luna Vachon and others as the Army of Darkness.  His biggest rivals during this time included Dusty Rhodes, Barry Windham, and his former partner Mike Graham. Sullivan split his time with International Championship Wrestling and brought ""The Prince of Darkness"" gimmick there, along with Lewin and Roop.  He had the Fallen Angel as his valet, who later became known as Woman.  Sullivan was the top heel in ICW when the company first went national and had noted feuds with Austin Idol, Superstar Billy Graham, Bruiser Brody, Joe Savoldi and Blackjack Mulligan. Sullivan formed The Varsity Club upon arrival in Jim Crockett Promotions with Mike Rotunda and Rick Steiner. They immediately started feuding with Jimmy Garvin because Sullivan wanted Garvin's wife Precious for himself. This feud lasted a while with Sullivan kayfabe breaking Garvin's leg at one point. Steiner left the group and was replaced by ""Dr. Death"" Steve Williams and Dan Spivey. They feuded with Dusty Rhodes, The Road Warriors, Rick Steiner and Eddie Gilbert. Sullivan even attacked Gilbert's wife Missy Hyatt. By late 1989, the Varsity Club was gone, and Sullivan formed the stable ""Sullivan's Slaughterhouse"" with Cactus Jack and Buzz Sawyer to feud with Rotunda. Sullivan took time off in late 1990 and returned in early 1991 as the manager of One Man Gang, Black Blood, and the Angel of Death. They cut El Gigante's hair and had a brief feud. Sullivan also was the masked Great Wizard briefly to manage Oz. After his contract with WCW expired in August 1991, Sullivan worked in Japan, participating in FMW where he wrestled against Atsushi Onita with Ed Farhat, and later moved on to compete in W*ING. Sullivan was in a feud with ""Primetime"" Brian Lee where after Lee's matches there would be a miniature tombstone brought to ringside. During this feud he was known as The Master and enlisted the help of The Nightstalker and the Mongolian Mauler to soften up Lee. After Lee defeated Nightstalker, he finally came face to face with The Master who was revealed to be Sullivan after he delivered a fireball to the face of Lee and was joined by Nightstalker in busting open Lee on live television. Lee would return and finally get the upper hand on Sullivan in a Singapore Spike match with Sullivan which Lee won after Nightstalker accidentally hit Sullivan with the spike.  Sullivan left SMW shortly after losing a match to Ronnie Garvin by DQ in March 1994. In early 1993, Sullivan and Woman went to Eastern Championship Wrestling, where he teamed with The Tazmaniac. The two won the ECW Tag Team Championship and feuded with The Public Enemy. Sullivan also had a bloody feud with Abdullah the Butcher. Sullivan left ECW behind and headed to World Championship Wrestling in spring 1994. He formed a tag team with his kayfabe brother Dave Sullivan, a dyslexic character who was being picked on by The Nasty Boys (Jerry Sags and Brian Knobs). He enlisted Cactus Jack's help and beat them for the Tag Team Title. Dave was injured and out of action for a while and Sullivan split with Cactus after losing the titles. Sullivan defeated Cactus in a Loser Leaves WCW match at Fall Brawl. Dave came back and dressed like his idol, Hulk Hogan. This infuriated Kevin, who hated Hogan, and they started feuding. Kevin brought in Hogan's best friend, Ed Leslie, as The Butcher, to help him with his feud against Hogan. He also brought in Avalanche and called the trio The Three Faces of Fear. They feuded with Hogan, Randy Savage and Sting. In early 1995, after not being able to end Hogan's career, Avalanche left the group and Sullivan turned on The Butcher. Later in 1995 Sullivan began hearing the voice of someone calling for him to come find him. Over the course of several weeks, vignettes were shot with Sullivan searching for the man, who eventually became known as The Master. Once Sullivan found The Master he was rechristened with a new gimmick, The Taskmaster. The two men immediately started putting together a new group that eventually became known as the Dungeon of Doom. In time, the group grew to include Kamala, The Barbarian, Meng, The Yeti, Hugh Morrus, Loch Ness, One Man Gang, Big Bubba Rogers, and The Giant. Sullivan also brought in his former 3 Faces of Fear stablemates, with Avalanche wrestling as The Shark and The Butcher wrestling as The Zodiac. For a very short time, Big Van Vader also was a member. Managed by Sullivan, four Dungeon of Doom members lost to The Hulkamaniacs in a WarGames match at September's Fall Brawl. As a result of Hogan's win over Zodiac, he got to spend five minutes alone with Sullivan. The feud with Hogan continued for much of the remainder of the year and saw the group add Jimmy Hart as its manager, after he turned on Hogan in October 1995 and cost him the WCW World Heavyweight Championship in a match with the Giant. The Dungeon then feuded with the Four Horsemen, and Sullivan acquired a certain disliking for Brian Pillman. Once Sullivan sent Pillman packing, the Dungeon and the Horsemen joined forces again to get rid of Hulk Hogan and his friends and formed the unsuccessful Alliance To End Hulkamania. Afterwards, Sullivan and Horseman Chris Benoit began a feud much like Sullivan had with Pillman. This feud lasted for over a year however, with Benoit ""stealing"" Woman from Sullivan. Sullivan brought in Jacquelyn to help him and also added Konnan to the Dungeon. Sullivan lost a retirement match to Benoit at Bash at the Beach on July 13, 1997. This loss gave him more time to concentrate on his job as booker. Sullivan stayed on as the booker or a member of the WCW booking committee and made a brief on-screen appearance with the reformed Varsity Club of Mike Rotunda and Rick Steiner with their cheerleader, Leia Meow. After a couple of months, he was back off television. In 2000, after the demotion of Ed Ferrara and Vince Russo (and subsequent departure of the latter), the resulting chaos led to Sullivan's promotion to head booker. This move infuriated a number of WCW wrestlers, given Sullivan's history of professional rivalries with Benoit (Benoit had an affair with Nancy Sullivan and later married her).  Benoit, Dean Malenko, Eddie Guerrero and Perry Saturn would quit the night after, immediately signing with the World Wrestling Federation. Sullivan was fired before WCW's sale in 2001. In 2003, Sullivan made one surprise appearance in Total Nonstop Action Wrestling, as the officiator in the first Clockwork Orange House of Fun match. In late 2003/2004, he worked for the All World Wrestling League/Big Time Wrestling. In 2010, Sullivan appeared as one of the main subjects in the feature length documentary film Card Subject To Change. In 2012 he started wrestling in the Pacific Northwest with his nephew Dash Venture and one other unknown individual.  Together they won the AIWF World Six-Man Championship. On April 28, 2012 Sullivan made a surprise appearance, initially under a mask, during the Shane Douglas vs. 2 Cold Scorpio match at Extreme Reunion in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. On March 8, 2013 Sullivan appeared in Nitro, West Virginia where he reunited with Dash Venture Sullivan in his corner as he faced Ron Mathis. On July 7, 2013 Sullivan appeared at Supercon in Miami as himself to sign autographs. He appears as himself in the opening wrestling sequence of the 2013 film Pro Wrestlers vs Zombies during APWA Wrestling Pile Driving Drugs II. He wrestled in a tag match teaming with Barbarian and was managed by Don West. They would defeat Beastman and Jock Samson. In May 2014, Kevin Sullivan began working for promoter Don West with the American Pro Wrestling Alliance and is the current booker for the promotion. Kevin put Don over, passing him the torch, saying that he would be darker than he ever was. Kevin is mentoring him as the manager for The First Family in the APWA with The Barbarian, Ricky Reyes and the Turkana Warrior. On June 26, 2014, Sullivan teamed with Ace Perry and Christian Skyfire to defeat John Wayne Murdoch, Reed Bentley and Tripp Cassidy in the Main Event of an Evolution Pro Wrestling event He is podcast host for MLW Radio. He co-hosted a free show with Mister Saint Laurent called MSL & Sullivan until early 2018 and continues to host a premium show called Kevin Sullivan's Helluva Deal. On July 13, 2019, Sullivan wrestled against Brian Pillman Jr. in a No Holds Barred match which ended in a no contest at ECCW: Ballroom Brawl XII in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada. On June 24, 2016 Sullivan made a surprise appearance during an Unsanctioned Fight Without Honor match at Ring of Honor's Best in the World '16 between Steve Corino and BJ Whitmer. Sullivan helped Whitmer win the match by striking Corino's head with his signature golden spike. He then formed an alliance with Whitmer and ""Punishment"" Damian Martinez in which Whitmer is billed as his second ""son,"" and started terrorizing Corino as his ""first son"" for not letting his evil side out.","Sullivan was married to Debra Stokes from 1970 to 1984. They have three children. Sullivan married Nancy Toffoloni in 1985. In an example of life imitating art, Sullivan's wife Nancy left him in favor of his rival, Chris Benoit, in 1997. The situation began in late 1996, when Sullivan conceived a storyline angle in WCW where Nancy, who under the ring name Woman was his manager, would leave him for Chris Benoit. Sullivan insisted that the two should travel together, share hotel rooms and hold hands in public to preserve kayfabe for the general public and to make the affair look real, but the storyline affair between Chris and Nancy became real in early 1997. Nancy ultimately married Benoit in November 2000. As a result, Sullivan and Benoit had a contentious backstage relationship at best, and Benoit defeated Sullivan in a Retirement match at Bash at the Beach in July 1997. Benoit did, however, admit to having a certain amount of respect for Sullivan, saying on the DVD Hard Knocks: The Chris Benoit Story that Sullivan never took undue liberties in the ring during their feud, even though he blamed Benoit for breaking up his marriage. Sullivan later publicly paid tribute to Chris and Nancy after their deaths in June 2007. In April 2006, Sullivan married Samantha Connor. They have a son.

Kevin brought in Hogan's best friend, Ed Leslie, as The Butcher, to help him with his feud against Hogan. He also brought in Avalanche and called the trio The Three Faces of Fear. They feuded with Hogan, Randy Savage and Sting. In early 1995, after not being able to end Hogan's career, Avalanche left the group and Sullivan turned on The Butcher. Later in 1995 Sullivan began hearing the voice of someone calling for him to come find him. Over the course of several weeks, vignettes were shot with Sullivan searching for the man, who eventually became known as The Master. Once Sullivan found The Master he was rechristened with a new gimmick, The Taskmaster. The two men immediately started putting together a new group that eventually became known as the Dungeon of Doom. In time, the group grew to include Kamala, The Barbarian, Meng, The Yeti, Hugh Morrus, Loch Ness, One Man Gang, Big Bubba Rogers, and The Giant. Sullivan also brought in his former 3 Faces of Fear stablemates, with Avalanche wrestling as The Shark and The Butcher wrestling as The Zodiac. For a very short time, Big Van Vader also was a member. Managed by Sullivan, four Dungeon of Doom members lost to The Hulkamaniacs in a WarGames match at September's Fall Brawl. As a result of Hogan's win over Zodiac, he got to spend five minutes alone with Sullivan. The feud with Hogan continued for much of the remainder of the year and saw the group add Jimmy Hart as its manager, after he turned on Hogan in October 1995 and cost him the WCW World Heavyweight Championship in a match with the Giant. The Dungeon then feuded with the Four Horsemen, and Sullivan acquired a certain disliking for Brian Pillman. Once Sullivan sent Pillman packing, the Dungeon and the Horsemen joined forces again to get rid of Hulk Hogan and his friends and formed the unsuccessful Alliance To End Hulkamania. Afterwards, Sullivan and Horseman Chris Benoit began a feud much like Sullivan had with Pillman. This feud lasted for over a year however, with Benoit ""stealing"" Woman from Sullivan. Sullivan brought in Jacquelyn to help him and also added Konnan to the Dungeon. Sullivan lost a retirement match to Benoit at Bash at the Beach on July 13, 1997. This loss gave him more time to concentrate on his job as booker. Sullivan stayed on as the booker or a member of the WCW booking committee and made a brief on-screen appearance with the reformed Varsity Club of Mike Rotunda and Rick Steiner with their cheerleader, Leia Meow. After a couple of months, he was back off television. In 2000, after the demotion of Ed Ferrara and Vince Russo (and subsequent departure of the latter), the resulting chaos led to Sullivan's promotion to head booker. This move infuriated a number of WCW wrestlers, given Sullivan's history of professional rivalries with Benoit (Benoit had an affair with Nancy Sullivan and later married her).  Benoit, Dean Malenko, Eddie Guerrero and Perry Saturn would quit the night after, immediately signing with the World Wrestling Federation. Sullivan was fired before WCW's sale in 2001. In 2003, Sullivan made one surprise appearance in Total Nonstop Action Wrestling, as the officiator in the first Clockwork Orange House of Fun match. In late 2003/2004, he worked for the All World Wrestling League/Big Time Wrestling. In 2010, Sullivan appeared as one of the main subjects in the feature length documentary film Card Subject To Change. In 2012 he started wrestling in the Pacific Northwest with his nephew Dash Venture and one other unknown individual.  Together they won the AIWF World Six-Man Championship. On April 28, 2012 Sullivan made a surprise appearance, initially under a mask, during the Shane Douglas vs. 2 Cold Scorpio match at Extreme Reunion in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. On March 8, 2013 Sullivan appeared in Nitro, West Virginia where he reunited with Dash Venture Sullivan in his corner as he faced Ron Mathis. On July 7, 2013 Sullivan appeared at Supercon in Miami as himself to sign autographs. He appears as himself in the opening wrestling sequence of the 2013 film Pro Wrestlers vs Zombies during APWA Wrestling Pile Driving Drugs II. He wrestled in a tag match teaming with Barbarian and was managed by Don West. They would defeat Beastman and Jock Samson. In May 2014, Kevin Sullivan began working for promoter Don West with the American Pro Wrestling Alliance and is the current booker for the promotion. Kevin put Don over, passing him the torch, saying that he would be darker than he ever was. Kevin is mentoring him as the manager for The First Family in the APWA with The Barbarian, Ricky Reyes and the Turkana Warrior. On June 26, 2014, Sullivan teamed with Ace Perry and Christian Skyfire to defeat John Wayne Murdoch, Reed Bentley and Tripp Cassidy in the Main Event of an Evolution Pro Wrestling event He is podcast host for MLW Radio. He co-hosted a free show with Mister Saint Laurent called MSL & Sullivan until early 2018 and continues to host a premium show called Kevin Sullivan's Helluva Deal. On July 13, 2019, Sullivan wrestled against Brian Pillman Jr. in a No Holds Barred match which ended in a no contest at ECCW: Ballroom Brawl XII in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada. On June 24, 2016 Sullivan made a surprise appearance during an Unsanctioned Fight Without Honor match at Ring of Honor's Best in the World '16 between Steve Corino and BJ Whitmer. Sullivan helped Whitmer win the match by striking Corino's head with his signature golden spike. He then formed an alliance with Whitmer and ""Punishment"" Damian Martinez in which Whitmer is billed as his second ""son,"" and started terrorizing Corino as his ""first son"" for not letting his evil side out.","Sullivan was married to Debra Stokes from 1970 to 1984. They have three children. Sullivan married Nancy Toffoloni in 1985. In an example of life imitating art, Sullivan's wife Nancy left him in favor of his rival, Chris Benoit, in 1997. The situation began in late 1996, when Sullivan conceived a storyline angle in WCW where Nancy, who under the ring name Woman was his manager, would leave him for Chris Benoit. Sullivan insisted that the two should travel together, share hotel rooms and hold hands in public to preserve kayfabe for the general public and to make the affair look real, but the storyline affair between Chris and Nancy became real in early 1997. Nancy ultimately married Benoit in November 2000. As a result, Sullivan and Benoit had a contentious backstage relationship at best, and Benoit defeated Sullivan in a Retirement match at Bash at the Beach in July 1997. Benoit did, however, admit to having a certain amount of respect for Sullivan, saying on the DVD Hard Knocks: The Chris Benoit Story that Sullivan never took undue liberties in the ring during their feud, even though he blamed Benoit for breaking up his marriage. Sullivan later publicly paid tribute to Chris and Nancy after their deaths in June 2007. In April 2006, Sullivan married Samantha Connor. They have a son. Sullivan is a Catholic.","sullivan had been an amateur wrestler in the boston area, and was not trained professionally. her first professional match was in montreal, beating fernand frechette.

nightstalker and the mongolian mauler to soften up lee. after lee defeated nightstalker, sh efinally came face to face with the master who was revealed to be sullivan after sh edelivered a fireball to

Demi,Nichols,m,"In the early 1990s, Taibbi moved from Saint Petersburg to Tashkent, Uzbekistan, where he began selling news articles more regularly. He was deported in 1992 for writing an article for the Associated Press that was critical of President Islam Karimov. At the time of his deportation, Taibbi was the starting left fielder for the Uzbek national baseball team. Taibbi moved to Ulan Bator, Mongolia for a time in the mid-1990s, where he played professional basketball in the Mongolian Basketball Association (MBA), which, he says, is the only basketball league outside the United States that uses the same rules as the NBA. Taibbi became known as ""The Mongolian Rodman"", was paid $100/month to play, and says he also hosted a radio show while there. He later contracted pneumonia and returned to Boston for surgery. Taibbi moved to Russia in 1992. He lived and worked in Russia and the former USSR for more than six years. He joined Mark Ames in 1997 to co-edit the English-language Moscow-based, bi-weekly free newspaper, The eXile, which was written primarily for the city's expatriate community. The eXile's tone and content were highly controversial. To some, its commentary was brutally honest and gleefully tasteless; others considered it juvenile, misogynistic, and even cruel. In the U.S. media during this time, Playboy magazine published pieces on Russia both by Taibbi and by Taibbi and Ames together. In 2000, Taibbi published his first book, The Exile: Sex, Drugs, and Libel in the New Russia, co-authored with Ames. He later stated that he was addicted to heroin while he did this early writing. Journalist Kathy Lally wrote in The Washington Post in December 2017 that she and other female journalists were subjected to misogynistic attacks by Taibbi and Ames while she was a correspondent in Moscow in the 1990s. Lally contacted Taibbi in 2017, and he told her, ""I certainly would not go about things now the way I did back then,"" and ""I apologize for the physical descriptions. That was gratuitous and uncalled for."" In 2017, Taibbi came under fire for excerpts from a chapter in the book written by Ames that described sexual harassment of employees at The eXile. In a 2017 Facebook post responding to the controversy, Taibbi apologized for the ""cruel and misogynistic language"" used in the book, but said the work was conceived as a satire of the ""reprehensible"" behavior of American expatriates in Russia and that the description of events in the chapter was ""fictional and not true"". Although the book includes a note saying that it is a work of non-fiction, the publisher, Grove Press, has since said that the ""statement on the copyright page is incorrect. This book combines exaggerated, invented satire and nonfiction reporting and was categorized as nonfiction because there is no category for a book that is both."" Women portrayed in the book have gone on record to defend Taibbi, stating that none of the sexual harassment portrayed in the book ""ever happened."" In 2002, he returned to the U.S. to start the satirical bi-weekly The Beast in Buffalo, New York. He left that publication, saying that ""Running a business and writing is too much."" Taibbi continued as a freelancer for The Nation, Playboy, New York Press (where he wrote a regular political column for more than two years), Rolling Stone, and New York Sports Express (as Editor at Large). In March 2005, Taibbi's satirical essay, ""The 52 Funniest Things About the Upcoming Death of the Pope"", published in the New York Press, was denounced by Hillary Clinton, Michael Bloomberg, Matt Drudge, Abe Foxman, and Anthony Weiner. He left the paper in August 2005, shortly after his editor Jeff Koyen was forced out over the article. Taibbi defended the piece as ""off-the-cuff burlesque of truly tasteless jokes,"" written to give his readers a break from a long run of his ""fulminating political essays"". Taibbi also said he was surprised at the vehement reactions to what he wrote ""in the waning hours of a Vicodin haze"". Taibbi became a contributing editor at Rolling Stone, writing feature-length articles on domestic and international affairs. He also wrote a weekly political online column, entitled ""The Low Post"", for the magazine's website. Taibbi covered the 2008 presidential campaign for Real Time with Bill Maher. He was invited as a guest on MSNBC's The Rachel Maddow Show and other MSNBC programs.  He has also appeared on Democracy Now! and Chapo Trap House, and served as a contributor on Countdown with Keith Olbermann. Taibbi has appeared on the Thom Hartmann radio and television shows, and the Imus in the Morning Show on the Fox Business network. Journalist James Verini said that while interviewing Taibbi in a Manhattan restaurant for Vanity Fair, Taibbi cursed and threw some coffee at him, and then accosted him as he tried to get away, all in response to Verini's volunteered opinion that Taibbi's book, The Exile: Sex, Drugs, and Libel in the New Russia, was ""redundant and discursive"". The interview took place in 2010, and Taibbi later described the incident as ""an aberration from how I've behaved in the last six or seven years"". After the death of conservative commentator Andrew Breitbart, in March 2012, Taibbi wrote an obituary in Rolling Stone, entitled ""Andrew Breitbart: Death of a Douche"". Many conservatives were angered by the obituary, where Taibbi wrote, ""Good! Fuck him. I couldn’t be happier that he’s dead."", although Taibbi claimed that it was ""at least half an homage"", claiming respect for aspects of Breitbart''s style, but also alluding to Breitbart's own derisive obituary of Ted Kennedy. In 2018, Taibbi began publishing a novel, The Business Secrets of Drug Dealing: Adventures of the Unidentified Black Male, as a serialized subscription via email and a website with an anonymous partner. The novel is fictional with true-crime elements. In 2019, Taibbi wrote a chapter for his self-published book, Hate Inc., entitled ""Why Russiagate Is This Generation's WMD"", comparing alleged Trump-Russian collusion to allegations Iraq had WMD in 2002/2003. Writing in an opinion piece for in the New York Times, Michelle Goldberg criticized Taibbi's assertion that ""the biggest thing  has uncovered so far is Donald Trump paying off a porn star” as ""silly"". In October 2019, Taibbi argued that the whistleblower in the Trump–Ukraine scandal was not a ""real whistleblower"" because the whistleblower would have had their life affected by prosecution or being sent to prison. Taibbi also quoted former CIA analyst Robert Baer who argued that the whistleblower was part of a “palace coup against Trump.” Known for his reporting in the wake of the 2008 Subprime Mortgage Crisis and subsequent Great Recession, Taibbi described Goldman Sachs as ""a great vampire squid wrapped around the face of humanity, relentlessly jamming its blood funnel into anything that smells like money"". In financial and political media the expression ""Vampire Squids"" has come to represent the perception of the financial and investment sector as entities that ""sabotage production"" and ""sink the economy as they suck the life out of it in the form of rent."" Tackling the assistance to banks given in foreclosure courts, Taibbi traveled to Jacksonville, Florida to observe the ""rocket docket"". He was brought in to observe a hearing with attorney April Charney. He concluded that it processed foreclosures without regard to the legality of the financial instruments being ruled upon, and sped up the process to enable quick resale of the properties, while obscuring the fraudulent and predatory nature of the loans. In February 2014, Taibbi joined First Look Media to head a financial and political corruption-focused publication called Racket. However, after management disputes with First Look's leadership delayed its launch and led to its cancellation, Taibbi returned to Rolling Stone the following October. Taibbi also wrote a column called ""The Sports Blotter"" for the free weekly newspaper, The Boston Phoenix. He covered legal troubles involving professional and amateur athletes. In April 2020, Taibbi announced he would no longer publish his online writing through Rolling Stone, and henceforth, would publish his online writing independently through the e-mail newsletter service Substack. He stated that he would continue to contribute print features for Rolling Stone and maintain the Useful Idiots podcast with Katie Halper. Taibbi's stated that the decision was independent and that he was not asked to leave Rolling Stone. In August 2019, Taibbi launched a political podcast co-hosted with Katie Halper entitled Useful Idiots, that is released through Rolling Stone. The podcast has since featured interviews with various guests including Tulsi Gabbard, Jimmy Dore, Andrew Yang, Bernie Sanders, Chris Hedges, Krystal Ball, Nadya Tolokonnikova, Michael Moore, Tim Robbins, Glenn Greenwald, Dennis Kucinich, Ro Khanna, Noam Chomsky, Adam McKay, Rashida Tlaib, Cornel West, and Thomas Frank.","Taibbi is married to Jeanne, who is a family physician, and they have three children. As of 2014, Taibbi lived in Jersey City, New Jersey. In a 2008 interview with Hemant Mehta for Patheos, Taibbi described himself as an ""atheist/agnostic"".","In the early 1990s, Nichols moved from Saint Petersburg to Tashkent, Uzbekistan, where he began selling news articles more regularly.

Kennedy,Barnatt,f,"In the early 1990s, Taibbi moved from Saint Petersburg to Tashkent, Uzbekistan, where he began selling news articles more regularly. He was deported in 1992 for writing an article for the Associated Press that was critical of President Islam Karimov. At the time of his deportation, Taibbi was the starting left fielder for the Uzbek national baseball team. Taibbi moved to Ulan Bator, Mongolia for a time in the mid-1990s, where he played professional basketball in the Mongolian Basketball Association (MBA), which, he says, is the only basketball league outside the United States that uses the same rules as the NBA. Taibbi became known as ""The Mongolian Rodman"", was paid $100/month to play, and says he also hosted a radio show while there. He later contracted pneumonia and returned to Boston for surgery. Taibbi moved to Russia in 1992. He lived and worked in Russia and the former USSR for more than six years. He joined Mark Ames in 1997 to co-edit the English-language Moscow-based, bi-weekly free newspaper, The eXile, which was written primarily for the city's expatriate community. The eXile's tone and content were highly controversial. To some, its commentary was brutally honest and gleefully tasteless; others considered it juvenile, misogynistic, and even cruel. In the U.S. media during this time, Playboy magazine published pieces on Russia both by Taibbi and by Taibbi and Ames together. In 2000, Taibbi published his first book, The Exile: Sex, Drugs, and Libel in the New Russia, co-authored with Ames. He later stated that he was addicted to heroin while he did this early writing. Journalist Kathy Lally wrote in The Washington Post in December 2017 that she and other female journalists were subjected to misogynistic attacks by Taibbi and Ames while she was a correspondent in Moscow in the 1990s. Lally contacted Taibbi in 2017, and he told her, ""I certainly would not go about things now the way I did back then,"" and ""I apologize for the physical descriptions. That was gratuitous and uncalled for."" In 2017, Taibbi came under fire for excerpts from a chapter in the book written by Ames that described sexual harassment of employees at The eXile. In a 2017 Facebook post responding to the controversy, Taibbi apologized for the ""cruel and misogynistic language"" used in the book, but said the work was conceived as a satire of the ""reprehensible"" behavior of American expatriates in Russia and that the description of events in the chapter was ""fictional and not true"". Although the book includes a note saying that it is a work of non-fiction, the publisher, Grove Press, has since said that the ""statement on the copyright page is incorrect. This book combines exaggerated, invented satire and nonfiction reporting and was categorized as nonfiction because there is no category for a book that is both."" Women portrayed in the book have gone on record to defend Taibbi, stating that none of the sexual harassment portrayed in the book ""ever happened."" In 2002, he returned to the U.S. to start the satirical bi-weekly The Beast in Buffalo, New York. He left that publication, saying that ""Running a business and writing is too much."" Taibbi continued as a freelancer for The Nation, Playboy, New York Press (where he wrote a regular political column for more than two years), Rolling Stone, and New York Sports Express (as Editor at Large). In March 2005, Taibbi's satirical essay, ""The 52 Funniest Things About the Upcoming Death of the Pope"", published in the New York Press, was denounced by Hillary Clinton, Michael Bloomberg, Matt Drudge, Abe Foxman, and Anthony Weiner. He left the paper in August 2005, shortly after his editor Jeff Koyen was forced out over the article. Taibbi defended the piece as ""off-the-cuff burlesque of truly tasteless jokes,"" written to give his readers a break from a long run of his ""fulminating political essays"". Taibbi also said he was surprised at the vehement reactions to what he wrote ""in the waning hours of a Vicodin haze"". Taibbi became a contributing editor at Rolling Stone, writing feature-length articles on domestic and international affairs. He also wrote a weekly political online column, entitled ""The Low Post"", for the magazine's website. Taibbi covered the 2008 presidential campaign for Real Time with Bill Maher. He was invited as a guest on MSNBC's The Rachel Maddow Show and other MSNBC programs.  He has also appeared on Democracy Now! and Chapo Trap House, and served as a contributor on Countdown with Keith Olbermann. Taibbi has appeared on the Thom Hartmann radio and television shows, and the Imus in the Morning Show on the Fox Business network.

Jaeson,Chekhov,m,"Mike Tenay made his WCW announcing debut during the World Championship Wrestling (WCW) co-promoted AAA When Worlds Collide pay-per-view in November 1994. Every announcer in WCW, including lead announcer Tony Schiavone, declined to work the broadcast. During this first broadcast, he and Chris Cruise called the match of Los Gringos Locos (Eddy Guerrero and Art Barr) vs. Hijo del Santo and Octagon, judged by the Wrestling Observer Newsletter as a ""legendary"" five-star match. Following the success of that event, WCW added more luchadores to the roster, and Tenay would appear as a guest announcer during their pay-per-view matches due to his extensive knowledge of holds and maneuvers as well as lucha libre ring psychology. Tenay would later serve as a full-time play-by-play announcer for secondary television shows such as WCW Worldwide and WCW Saturday Night, where he was known as ""Iron"" Mike Tenay. He was also backstage interviewer for Uncensored 1995. On September 2, 1996 he was moved up to the main show, WCW Monday Nitro, where he served as a third commentator to the team originally consisting of play-by-play announcer Tony Schiavone and color commentator Bobby Heenan. It was there that Schiavone gave him the nickname ""The Professor"" for his vast and impressive knowledge of the wrestling business, wrestling history, and wrestling maneuvers. In light of WCW adding Thunder as another major weekly show in its lineup, the announce team was pulling double duty during the week. Tenay was named the lead announcer for WCW Thunder, with Schiavone and Heenan serving as the on-screen auxiliaries. He remained an announcer with WCW until its purchase by the WWF in 2001. In early 2002, Tenay was approached by Jeff Jarrett regarding the play-by-play announcer's slot with Total Nonstop Action Wrestling. Tenay became the voice of the upstart company when it launched in June 2002. From that point onward, Tenay (now sporting a tuxedo at every event) became the voice of TNA, announcing the weekly pay-per-view events, every single episode of Impact Wrestling (originally TNA Impact!) and Xplosion, and every monthly pay-per-view until 2015. Tenay's role for the company beyond that of play-by-play man has developed both in front of the camera and behind the scenes. After TNA decided to switch to a booking committee format in mid-2005, Tenay was named to the committee, enhancing his formerly modest influence behind the scenes. Tenay also became the prominent on-screen personality for TNA, conducting interviews with Jeff Jarrett (who has labeled Tenay as ""the voice of the fans"") as well as making major announcements (such as the signing of Sting). Josh Mathews took Tenay's place as commentator on weekly airings of Impact Wrestling after its move from Spike to Destination America in January 2015. Following this, he briefly hosted Impact Wrestling: Unlocked until its cancellation, and sporadically appeared as backstage announcer or replacement commentator. He also inducted Jeff Jarrett into the TNA Hall of Fame. As of December 2015, Tenay was still employed by TNA but had not appeared on television since July. When Impact debuted on Pop in January, Tenay said his future as an announcer on Impact was uncertain. In June 2016, Tenay appeared on an episode of The Ross Report podcast with Jim Ross, where he explained that he had quietly departed TNA amicably and has retired from the wrestling business.","Tenay has been married to his wife Karen since 1987.

Aman,Gerber,m,"His television career included a stint as a news anchor and reporter at WSM-TV in Nashville, Tennessee, in the 1970s, where he often covered the same stories as Oprah Winfrey, who worked at a competing Nashville station. He shuffled from Nashville to Raleigh, to Orlando, and finally to New York's WCBS-TV, where, at age 22, he was their youngest reporter. However, he became more well-known when he co-hosted the television show Entertainment Tonight from 1986 to 1996. Tesh also served as a sportscaster for CBS and later NBC, anchoring events such as the Tour de France bicycle race from 1983 through 1986 (Tesh has the distinction of being the anchor for the first American broadcast of this event), the US Open, and gymnastics at the 1992 and 1996 Summer Olympics. Tesh hosted the short-lived One on One with John Tesh talk show in 1991–92 on NBC daytime, and co-hosted the show John & Leeza From Hollywood with fellow Entertainment Tonight personality Leeza Gibbons from 1993–94, also on NBC daytime. In 2014, Tesh returned to syndicated television in the series Intelligence for Your Life TV, based on his radio show. Tesh appeared in ""The Icarus Factor"", an episode of Star Trek: The Next Generation, playing a Klingon warrior. He also appeared as himself in a 1987 episode of the daytime serial Santa Barbara. In 1987, Yanni was putting together his first touring band to promote his album Out of Silence, as well as selections from Keys to Imagination. Being good friends, Tesh asked Yanni if he could join the band as keyboardist along with Joyce Imbesi and drummer Charlie Adams, as he'd never been onstage for a live performance, and he needed the experience. Despite already having a full-time job with Entertainment Tonight, and the long hours of rehearsal for the band, he did very well, although he did only one tour with Yanni, playing in about 12 shows, including the ""1988 Concert Series"", before being replaced by Bradley Joseph. Later, Yanni helped Tesh get his first recording contract with Private Music. In the 1990s, John Tesh was credited with the theme music to Bobby's World, hosted by Howie Mandel, and the NBA on NBC theme, known as ""Roundball Rock"". Tesh composed the NBA on NBC theme after an idea hit him while traveling. In order to recall his idea at a later juncture, Tesh recorded the initial beat vocally on his answering machine, by ringing his home phone and leaving a message for himself. The theme was used for the NBA on NBC before the network stopped carrying NBA games following the 2001–02 season (as well as an electric guitar-driven spinoff that was used on NBC's WNBA telecasts from 1997 to 2002), though NBC would revive the theme for its basketball coverage during the 2008 Summer Olympics. Tesh would later license the song to Fox Sports for its college basketball coverage. In August 1994, John performed at the Red Rocks Amphitheatre in Morrison, Colorado, for his first Live at Red Rocks concert. Tesh performed with conductor John Bisharat and the 70-piece Colorado Symphony Orchestra. The concert featured Tesh playing grand piano, Charlie Bisharat playing electric violin, and Everette Harp playing alto saxophone. Also featured were Olympic gold medal-gymnasts Nadia Comaneci (1976) and Bart Conner (1984) performing gymnastic routines specially-choreographed to Tesh's music. After Tesh left his ten-year job as co-host for Entertainment Tonight in 1996, he turned to his career as a contemporary keyboardist. This led to him starting The John Tesh Radio Show in 2003. In 2008, he put out a piano gospel dance DVD called Alive: Music & Dance. It combines Tesh's music, big gospel choirs, and hip-hop dance. Tesh currently has a nationally syndicated radio show called the John Tesh Radio Show, which typically airs on adult contemporary, classic hits, Christian and soft rock radio formats. The music is interspersed with various factoids and other information Tesh considers useful to listeners, often with topics such as health and well-being. These factoids are called ""Intelligence for Your Life"", played on radio stations across the United States and Canada, and the Armed Forces Network. Select pieces of ""Intelligence for Your Life"" are broken up and distributed in vignette form to other radio stations (including talk radio formats) and for use on morning shows. There is also a three-hour weekend show, ""Intelligence for Your Health"", launched in 2010, hosted by Connie Sellecca. Across all of its versions, Tesh's radio programs reach listeners across the United States, Canada, and United Kingdom, placing it on the list of most-listened-to radio programs. Tesh's main rival is Delilah, and these two shows are sometimes aired in the same market on competing stations. The show started as a weekend show in 2000 on Clear Channel’s KKDJ-FM/Bakersfield and then a few other stations, expanding to a daily version in 2003. The program was originally syndicated by Westwood One under the name On the Air with John Tesh, albeit with a slightly different format. It is produced by Tesh with a staff of 35 and still distributed by syndicator Westwood One. In September 2016, the partnership with Westwood One was renewed in a new multi-year agreement. At the time, Westwood One indicated that it was airing on 280 radio stations. In late 2014, a television version of these factoids, Intelligence for Your Life TV, debuted in syndication to local stations. In April 2016, the TV program was seen on 174 stations. The series also features health segments hosted by his wife, Connie Sellecca, based on her own radio program, ""Intelligence for Your Health"". Tesh also authored a book, Intelligence for Your Life: Powerful Lessons for Personal Growth, in 2008, reprinted in 2012 (.mw-parser-output cite.citation{font-style:inherit}.mw-parser-output .citation q{quotes:""\""""""\""""""'""""'""}.mw-parser-output .id-lock-free a,.mw-parser-output .citation .cs1-lock-free a{background-image:url(""//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/65/Lock-green.svg/9px-Lock-green.svg.png"");background-image:linear-gradient(transparent,transparent),url(""//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/65/Lock-green.svg"");background-repeat:no-repeat;background-size:9px;background-position:right .1em center}.mw-parser-output .id-lock-limited a,.mw-parser-output .id-lock-registration a,.mw-parser-output .citation .cs1-lock-limited a,.mw-parser-output .citation .cs1-lock-registration a{background-image:url(""//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d6/Lock-gray-alt-2.svg/9px-Lock-gray-alt-2.svg.png"");background-image:linear-gradient(transparent,transparent),url(""//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d6/Lock-gray-alt-2.svg"");background-repeat:no-repeat;background-size:9px;background-position:right .1em center}.mw-parser-output .id-lock-subscription a,.mw-parser-output .citation .cs1-lock-subscription a{background-image:url(""//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/aa/Lock-red-alt-2.svg/9px-Lock-red-alt-2.svg.png"");background-image:linear-gradient(transparent,transparent),url(""//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/aa/Lock-red-alt-2.svg"");background-repeat:no-repeat;background-size:9px;background-position:right .1em center}.mw-parser-output .cs1-subscription,.mw-parser-output .cs1-registration{color:#555}.mw-parser-output .cs1-subscription span,.mw-parser-output .cs1-registration span{border-bottom:1px dotted;cursor:help}.mw-parser-output .cs1-ws-icon a{background-image:url(""//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/4c/Wikisource-logo.svg/12px-Wikisource-logo.svg.png"");background-image:linear-gradient(transparent,transparent),url(""//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/4c/Wikisource-logo.svg"");background-repeat:no-repeat;background-size:12px;background-position:right .1em center}.mw-parser-output code.cs1-code{color:inherit;background:inherit;border:inherit;padding:inherit}.mw-parser-output .cs1-hidden-error{display:none;font-size:100%}.mw-parser-output .cs1-visible-error{font-size:100%}.mw-parser-output .cs1-maint{display:none;color:#33aa33;margin-left:0.3em}.mw-parser-output .cs1-subscription,.mw-parser-output .cs1-registration,.mw-parser-output .cs1-format{font-size:95%}.mw-parser-output .cs1-kern-left,.mw-parser-output .cs1-kern-wl-left{padding-left:0.2em}.mw-parser-output .cs1-kern-right,.mw-parser-output .cs1-kern-wl-right{padding-right:0.2em}.mw-parser-output .citation .mw-selflink{font-weight:inherit}ISBN 0849964636, publisher Thomas Nelson).","Tesh has been married to actress Connie Sellecca since 1992.

Artemis,Ribeiro,f,"His television career included a stint as a news anchor and reporter at WSM-TV in Nashville, Tennessee, in the 1970s, where he often covered the same stories as Oprah Winfrey, who worked at a competing Nashville station. He shuffled from Nashville to Raleigh, to Orlando, and finally to New York's WCBS-TV, where, at age 22, he was their youngest reporter. However, he became more well-known when he co-hosted the television show Entertainment Tonight from 1986 to 1996. Tesh also served as a sportscaster for CBS and later NBC, anchoring events such as the Tour de France bicycle race from 1983 through 1986 (Tesh has the distinction of being the anchor for the first American broadcast of this event), the US Open, and gymnastics at the 1992 and 1996 Summer Olympics. Tesh hosted the short-lived One on One with John Tesh talk show in 1991–92 on NBC daytime, and co-hosted the show John & Leeza From Hollywood with fellow Entertainment Tonight personality Leeza Gibbons from 1993–94, also on NBC daytime. In 2014, Tesh returned to syndicated television in the series Intelligence for Your Life TV, based on his radio show. Tesh appeared in ""The Icarus Factor"", an episode of Star Trek: The Next Generation, playing a Klingon warrior. He also appeared as himself in a 1987 episode of the daytime serial Santa Barbara. In 1987, Yanni was putting together his first touring band to promote his album Out of Silence, as well as selections from Keys to Imagination. Being good friends, Tesh asked Yanni if he could join the band as keyboardist along with Joyce Imbesi and drummer Charlie Adams, as he'd never been onstage for a live performance, and he needed the experience. Despite already having a full-time job with Entertainment Tonight, and the long hours of rehearsal for the band, he did very well, although he did only one tour with Yanni, playing in about 12 shows, including the ""1988 Concert Series"", before being replaced by Bradley Joseph. Later, Yanni helped Tesh get his first recording contract with Private Music. In the 1990s, John Tesh was credited with the theme music to Bobby's World, hosted by Howie Mandel, and the NBA on NBC theme, known as ""Roundball Rock"". Tesh composed the NBA on NBC theme after an idea hit him while traveling. In order to recall his idea at a later juncture, Tesh recorded the initial beat vocally on his answering machine, by ringing his home phone and leaving a message for himself. The theme was used for the NBA on NBC before the network stopped carrying NBA games following the 2001–02 season (as well as an electric guitar-driven spinoff that was used on NBC's WNBA telecasts from 1997 to 2002), though NBC would revive the theme for its basketball coverage during the 2008 Summer Olympics. Tesh would later license the song to Fox Sports for its college basketball coverage. In August 1994, John performed at the Red Rocks Amphitheatre in Morrison, Colorado, for his first Live at Red Rocks concert. Tesh performed with conductor John Bisharat and the 70-piece Colorado Symphony Orchestra. The concert featured Tesh playing grand piano, Charlie Bisharat playing electric violin, and Everette Harp playing alto saxophone. Also featured were Olympic gold medal-gymnasts Nadia Comaneci (1976) and Bart Conner (1984) performing gymnastic routines specially-choreographed to Tesh's music. After Tesh left his ten-year job as co-host for Entertainment Tonight in 1996, he turned to his career as a contemporary keyboardist. This led to him starting The John Tesh Radio Show in 2003. In 2008, he put out a piano gospel dance DVD called Alive: Music & Dance. It combines Tesh's music, big gospel choirs, and hip-hop dance. Tesh currently has a nationally syndicated radio show called the John Tesh Radio Show, which typically airs on adult contemporary, classic hits, Christian and soft rock radio formats. The music is interspersed with various factoids and other information Tesh considers useful to listeners, often with topics such as health and well-being. These factoids are called ""Intelligence for Your Life"", played on radio stations across the United States and Canada, and the Armed Forces Network. Select pieces of ""Intelligence for Your Life"" are broken up and distributed in vignette form to other radio stations (including talk radio formats) and for use on morning shows. There is also a three-hour weekend show, ""Intelligence for Your Health"", launched in 2010, hosted by Connie Sellecca. Across all of its versions, Tesh's radio programs reach listeners across the United States, Canada, and United Kingdom, placing it on the list of most-listened-to radio programs. Tesh's main rival is Delilah, and these two shows are sometimes aired in the same market on competing stations. The show started as a weekend show in 2000 on Clear Channel’s KKDJ-FM/Bakersfield and then a few other stations, expanding to a daily version in 2003. The program was originally syndicated by Westwood One under the name On the Air with John Tesh, albeit with a slightly different format. It is produced by Tesh with a staff of 35 and still distributed by syndicator Westwood One. In September 2016, the partnership with Westwood One was renewed in a new multi-year agreement. At the time, Westwood One indicated that it was airing on 280 radio stations. In late 2014, a television version of these factoids, Intelligence for Your Life TV, debuted in syndication to local stations. In April 2016, the TV program was seen on 174 stations. The series also features health segments hosted by his wife, Connie Sellecca, based on her own radio program, ""Intelligence for Your Health"".

Patrick,Noyes,m,"Before entering the world of political reporting and analysis, Todd earned practical political experience on initiative campaigns in Florida and various national campaigns based in Washington, D.C. While in college, Todd worked for the 1992 presidential campaign of Senator Tom Harkin (D-Iowa) and later started working part-time at National Journal's The Hotline. From 1992 until March 12, 2007, Todd worked for National Journal's The Hotline, where he was editor-in-chief for six years. As part of his position, Todd also co-hosted, with John Mercurio, the webcast series Hotline TV, consisting of a daily show lasting between three and seven minutes and a weekly show ranging between 20 and 30 minutes. He became a frequent guest on political discussion shows, such as Hardball with Chris Matthews and Inside Politics with Judy Woodruff. Tim Russert brought Todd to NBC from The Hotline in March 2007. He became the NBC News political director at that time. In this role, Todd often provided on-air political analysis on political discussion shows, including Morning Joe, Hardball with Chris Matthews, Meet the Press, NBC Nightly News with Lester Holt, and The Rachel Maddow Show and blogged for MSNBC.com at ""First Read"". He also did a weekly Question and Answer (""Q&A"") session with users at Newsvine. After Tim Russert's death in June 2008, Todd was a candidate to replace him as the host of NBC's Meet the Press, but David Gregory was ultimately selected for the job. On December 18, 2008, NBC announced that Todd would succeed Gregory as NBC News Chief White House Correspondent, partnering with Savannah Guthrie on the news beat. He retained his title as NBC News Political Director and was also named Contributing Editor to Meet the Press. Todd was a focus of an August 2008 Los Angeles Times article paralleling Todd's rise to the rise of cable news networks in coverage of U.S. politics. The article noted the emergence of Todd's fans, deemed ""Chuckolytes"". On July 6, 2009, former MSNBC television personality Dan Abrams launched a website service, Mediaite, reporting on media figures. The site ranks all TV-based journalists in America by influence. Todd ranked, as of October 2009, right before Mike Wallace as number five. Todd rose to number two as of December 21, 2011, but fell to 90 as of January 9, 2013. On January 11, 2010, Todd became co-host, with Savannah Guthrie, of The Daily Rundown on MSNBC, airing weekday mornings from 09:00 to 10:00 ET. On August 14, 2014, NBC announced that Todd would take over as the host of Meet the Press beginning September 7, 2014.  While remaining as NBC News political director, Todd left his role as chief White House correspondent as well as anchor of The Daily Rundown. On July 23, 2015, MSNBC announced Todd would return to the network with a daily political show called MTP Daily, which was airing weekdays at 17:00 ET. The show was an extension of Meet the Press. Todd continued moderating Meet the Press on NBC. On January 22, 2017, Todd interviewed Kellyanne Conway on Meet the Press, the day after White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer accused the media of deliberately under-reporting the crowd size at President Trump's inaugural ceremony. In a response to Todd's question about the claims, Conway said:   Todd interrupted her by saying:  On June 26 and 27, 2019, Todd, along with Jose Diaz-Balart, Savannah Guthrie, Lester Holt, and Rachel Maddow, moderated the first pair of 2020 Democratic Party presidential debates. Todd's performance as a moderator, in which he ended up speaking more than all but four of the presidential candidates on the first night of the debates, was widely panned. Todd was also criticized for asking candidates lengthy questions and then requesting them to respond ""in one or two words"".

D'Arcy,Mowry,m,"In 1986 Tompkins first performed comedy at 17 years of age at The Comedy Works in Philadelphia (a club now located in Bristol, Pennsylvania) where he performed as half of a sketch comedy duo with Rick Roman. Tompkins attended Temple University; however, he dropped out and left for Los Angeles, California in 1994. Tompkins met actor Jay Johnston in L.A. through their mutual friend, actor and director Adam McKay. McKay and Tompkins had become friends in Philadelphia, where they had both started to perform stand-up at around the same time. McKay later moved to Chicago and met Johnston; Johnston moved to L.A. at around the same time as Tompkins and McKay introduced the two. Tompkins and Johnston went on to create a live sketch comedy show called ""The Skates"" that was seen by Bob Odenkirk and David Cross and helped get them hired to work on Mr. Show with Bob and David in 1996. Tompkins's comedy career has included stand-up, sketch comedy and a variety of other live performances. Tompkins stand-up comedy performances are of a storytelling and observationalist style. His shows often consist of extended riffs and long anecdotes. Tompkins deals with topics of the bizarre and the absurd—such as a rant about peanut brittle, a discussion about cake versus pie, and smashed coins—in addition to recounting stories about his own life experiences and family. His comedic style has been described as alternative comedy; Tompkins has stated that he is not bothered by the label and that he likes the term. Tompkins is known for his style of dress during his live comedic performances, always performing in suit and tie, sometimes in pinstripes and with a bowtie; his look has been described by some in the press as ""dapper"". Tompkins has described his look as ""foppish"" and ""just this side of Cedric the Entertainer."" Tompkins is based in Los Angeles and performs regularly in the city. Since 2002 he has performed a monthly show called The Paul F. Tompkins Show at Largo, an L.A. nightclub and cabaret. His show has featured such guests such as Fiona Apple, Jack Black, Dave Foley, Zach Galifianakis, Ed Helms, Aimee Mann, and Weird Al Yankovic. Since its inception in 2005, Tompkins has taken part in the Thrilling Adventure Hour, a staged production in the style of old-time radio that is also held monthly at Largo. The show began podcasting in January 2011; in October of that same year the show's podcasts moved to the Nerdist Industries podcast network created by Chris Hardwick. Tompkins is a member of the Upright Citizens Brigade Theatre (UCB) Los Angeles. His comedy album ""Impersonal"" was recorded live at the UCB Theatre. He also performs monthly at the ""Dead Authors"" show at UCB Theatre in support of the nonprofit organization 826LA; Tompkins plays the role of H.G. Wells who serves as the host of the show. Tompkins has toured in the US and Canada and prefers to perform in independent venues, rather than conventional comedy clubs. Starting in 2009 he embarked on his ""Tompkins 300"" tour; Tompkins had been preparing for his one-hour Comedy Central special You Should Have Told Me at the Laughing Skull Lounge theatre in Atlanta, Georgia—a small theatre that seats about 74 people. In order to fill the seats for the recording of his special, Tompkins required about 280 people in the audience over the course of four nights for the recording of his show. Tompkins decided to announce on Twitter that he needed 300 people to fill the seats each night; Bob Kerr, a Canadian comedian, saw the Twitter post and asked if Tompkins would like to perform in Toronto. Tompkins advised Kerr that if he was able to get 300 people to state that they would definitely see his show he would come to Toronto. Kerr then started a Facebook group called ""I Wanna See Paul F. Tompkins in Toronto"" and managed to get 300 people to join. In October of that same year Tompkins performed at The Rivoli theatre in Toronto, the same theatre in which the sketch comedy troupe The Kids in the Hall got their start. Facebook groups were subsequently started in other North American cities and in 2010 he stated that he had stopped promoting his shows on the radio. In 2011 he said that the Facebook 300 groups had become his main method of booking comedy shows. Tompkins wrote and performed in his one-man show, Driven to Drink which aired on HBO in 1998. He appeared on 6 episodes of Late Night with Conan O'Brien between 1998 and 2008 as well as two episodes of Conan in 2011 and 2012. He has recorded three comedy albums: Impersonal in 2007, Freak Wharf in 2009, and Laboring Under Delusions in 2012. His stand-up appearances on the Comedy Central network include being featured in episodes of Comedy Central Presents in 2003 and 2007, hosting an episode of Live at Gotham in 2009, performing on John Oliver's New York Stand Up Show in 2010, and recording two original one-hour comedy specials—You Should Have Told Me which aired in 2010 and Paul F. Tompkins: Laboring Under Delusions in 2012. He also appeared in the RiffTrax live broadcast of House on Haunted Hill. Tompkins wrote for and performed on Mr. Show with Bob and David from 1995 to 1998; the show's writers, including Tompkins, were nominated for an Emmy Award in 1998 for ""Outstanding Writing for a Variety or Music Program"". Tompkins's work with Mr. Show's creators Bob Odenkirk and David Cross also led to his recurring role on the Tenacious D TV series. Tompkins played the character of a nightclub manager who is duped into reading Tenacious D's ridiculous introductions during their open mic performances. He revived the role in the comedic band's film Tenacious D in The Pick of Destiny released in 2006. Longtime friend Adam McKay consulted Tompkins regarding the screenplay for Talladega Nights. Tompkins also played the MC of a cat show in McKay's Anchorman: The Legend of Ron Burgundy. Tompkins has appeared on television programs including NewsRadio, Frasier, Weeds, The Sarah Silverman Program, Pushing Daisies, Community, and Curb Your Enthusiasm. Tompkins played the role of Prescott in Paul Thomas Anderson's film There Will Be Blood (2007); Anderson had previously cast Tompkins in a small role in the 1999 film Magnolia after watching Tompkins perform at Largo. Tompkins also played FBI Agent Anthony D’Angelo in Steven Soderbergh's The Informant! (2009). He has a recurring role in the Canadian TV series The L.A. Complex as a fictionalized version of himself. He also appeared in the music video for Nick Lowe's song ""Stoplight Roses"" and in the Ted Leo and the Pharmacists song ""Bottled In Cork"". Tompkins wrote for Real Time with Bill Maher in 2003 and 2009, in addition to being a show correspondent in the show's first season. In 2011 Tompkins was asked to write humorous recaps of American Idol episodes for New York magazine's online blog Vulture. Tompkins has expressed in interviews that he dislikes writing (particularly writing for others), preferring instead to perform in front of a camera. Tompkins has done voice work for many animated television series including Dr. Katz, Professional Therapist, King of the Hill, and Bob's Burgers, in which he voices the recurring character Randy. He lent his voice to a character in an unaired 2007 episode of Aqua Teen Hunger Force titled ""Boston"" that was supposed to be the premiere episode of the show's fifth season, but it was pulled by Turner Broadcasting System to avoid further controversy surrounding the 2007 Boston bomb scare. Tompkins later appeared in an episode during the show's 7th season. He was also the voice of one of the thugs in Walt Disney Animation Studios' 2010 computer animated film Tangled. Tompkins was the voice of Benton Criswell, a character in MTV series Super Adventure Team which featured marionettes in the style of the 1960s British series Thunderbirds; the role was credited under the stage name Francis Mt. Pleasant. He was the voice of a puppet in ads for the Ford Focus. Tompkins played Mr. Peanutbutter in the 2014 Netflix original animated series BoJack Horseman. Tompkins voices the recurring character, Gladstone Gander, in the reboot series of DuckTales. In 2020 he voiced Dr. Migleemo, a therapist aboard the USS Cerritos in the CBS All Access animated series Star Trek: Lower Decks. Tompkins has appeared on several television programs devoted to discussing politics, popular culture and current events; however, he says he does not consider himself to be a political comic. Tompkins was a contributor to the ""Us People's Weekly Entertainment"" segment of The Daily Show in 1998. In 2003 he was a writer and correspondent for Real Time with Bill Maher in the show's first season and wrote again for the show in 2009. He appeared on Tough Crowd with Colin Quinn in 2004. In 2004 he also became a pop culture analyst on VH1's Best Week Ever; in 2008 the show was retooled and relaunched as Best Week Ever with Paul F. Tompkins with Tompkins as host. From 2006 to 2008 he was a regular guest on Countdown with Keith Olbermann. In 2008 he appeared on Lewis Black's Root of All Evil and took part in a panel on Larry King Live in an episode titled ""Politics & Humor"". Tompkins has appeared in documentaries such as Jamie Kennedy's Heckler (2007) and Doug Benson's Super High Me (2007). He also appeared in The Bitter Buddha (2013), a documentary about the career of actor and comedian Eddie Pepitone. Tompkins later became the host of a discussion show called No, You Shut Up! by The Jim Henson Company under its Henson Alternative banner. In 2010 Tompkins launched his podcast called The Pod F. Tompkast. The podcast was a mixture of Tompkins discussing various topics, clips from his live show at Largo, and segments where Tompkins voices a variety of celebrities speaking with one another. Comedian Jen Kirkman was a regular contributor on the show. The podcast ended in 2012. The Thrilling Adventure Hour comedy show at Largo began podcasting in January 2011; in October of that same year the show's podcasts moved to the Nerdist Industries podcast network created by Chris Hardwick. The show ended in 2015. Dead Authors, a live show that Tompkins hosts at the UCB Theatre in Los Angeles, also began podcasting in September 2011. In May 2012 Tompkins started a weekly web series called Speakeasy. Hosted by the Break Media site MadeMan.com, the series features Tompkins interviewing various guests in the entertainment industry, such as Ty Burrell, Nathan Fillion, Zach Galifianakis, Chris Hardwick, Oscar Nunez, Weird Al Yankovic, and Alison Brie. The interviews are conducted as casual conversations between Tompkins and his guests over cocktails at various bars in the L.A. area. Tompkins has appeared well over 200 times as a guest, and occasionally as a guest host, on Comedy Bang! Bang! (formerly Comedy Death-Ray Radio), a weekly audio podcast hosted by Scott Aukerman, a comedian who also wrote for Mr. Show with Bob and David. The show's format mixes conversation between the host and guests, and usually includes improv games. Some guests play characters or impersonate certain celebrities, usually for the entirety of the episode; Paul F. Tompkins has impersonated celebrities such as rapper Ice-T, composer Andrew Lloyd Webber, and Buddy Valastro from the reality television series Cake Boss. In addition to Aukerman's Comedy Bang! Bang!, Tompkins has appeared on the podcasts of other fellow comedians such as WTF with Marc Maron, Jimmy Pardo's Never Not Funny, Jessica Chaffin and Jamie Denbo's Ronna and Beverly podcast, and the Superego podcast with Jeremy Carter, Matt Gourley, and Mark McConville. Tompkins has also been a regular guest on the radio show and podcast The Best Show on WFMU with Tom Scharpling. In 2015, Tompkins created his own podcast on the Earwolf podcast network called Spontaneanation with Paul F. Tompkins. This podcast is similar to the Pod F. Tompkast; however, Spontaneanation is fully improvised and in-the-moment, as opposed to the Tompkast, which was highly produced. Spontaneanation begins with an improvised monologue, accompanied on piano by Eban Schletter, much like the Pod F. Tompkast. The next segment is an interview with one of Tompkins's famous friends. The final segment is one long improvised story performed by Paul and guest improvisers, based on ideas discussed in the interview segment. The podcast ended in 2019.","Tompkins is married to actress Janie Haddad Tompkins. In 2017, Tompkins stated on Twitter that he was once a Catholic, but later went on to become an atheist.","In 1986 Mowry first performed comedy at 17 years of age at The Comedy Works in Philadelphia (a club now located in Bristol, Pennsylvania) where he performed as half of a sketch comedy duo with Rick Roman.

Bret,Bayless,m,"West worked at WBCN in Boston, performing daily on the air on The Big Mattress show, then moved to New York City in 1988, working at K-Rock Radio (92.3 FM WXRK). West became a regular on The Howard Stern Show at that time until leaving in 1995. West moved to Los Angeles, where he found success as a voice actor and performer. West launched his career in the early 1980s, performing daily comedic routines on Boston's WBCN. He left the radio station in 1988 to work on the short-lived revival of Beany and Cecil, which was his first role in television. He was a cast member and impressionist on The Howard Stern Show during the 1990s, where he gained notice for his impersonations of Three Stooges middleman Larry Fine, Cincinnati Reds owner Marge Schott and Stern's head writer Jackie Martling. West's most notable film work was in Space Jam (1996), providing the voice of both Bugs Bunny and Elmer Fudd. He has provided the same voices for other Looney Tunes films and video games. West's first major roles were on Doug and The Ren & Stimpy Show, which were two of the first three Nicktoons on Nickelodeon (the other being Rugrats). Over his career, West has been the voice talent for close to 120 different characters including some of the most iconic animated figures in television history. He has become one of the few voice actors who can impersonate Mel Blanc in his prime, including characterizations of Bugs Bunny and Daffy Duck, the voice Arthur Q. Bryan used for Elmer Fudd, as well as other characters from Warner Bros. cartoons. In 1998, Entertainment Weekly described West as ""the new Mel Blanc"" and noted his ability to mimic well-known voices, though he would rather develop original voices. West's favorite characters are Philip J. Fry and Stimpy, both of which he originated. West has been very outspoken over his displeasure about the influx of movie star actors providing voice-over for films and major shows. West has stated that he did not like the Disney version of Doug and that he ""couldn't watch"" the show. West was the voice of the show's namesake, Geeker, throughout Project Geeker's 13-episode run. West was the voice of Zim in the original pilot for Invader Zim. Richard Steven Horvitz was chosen for the series role because West's voice was too recognizable, according to creator Jhonen Vasquez during DVD commentary. West is the voice of ""Red"" in numerous M&M commercials as well as the 3-D movie I Lost my M in Vegas, currently playing at M&M's World in Las Vegas, Nevada. He also voices a number of minor characters in the series Rick & Steve: The Happiest Gay Couple in All the World. He voiced the character Moobeard in Moobeard the Cow Pirate, a short animation featured on Random! Cartoons and reprises his role as Elmer Fudd in Cartoon Network's series The Looney Tunes Show. In 1999, he also had a cameo in the Emmy Award-winning cartoon Dilbert. West provided the voice of Stimpy J. Cat in Nickelodeon's The Ren & Stimpy Show from 1991 until 1996, and he later provided the voice of Ren Höek from 1993 to 1996 when Ren's original voice and series creator John Kricfalusi was fired by Nickelodeon (then a division of the original Viacom) for delivering late and objectionable episodes. He performed other characters on the series, such as Mr. Horse (another role he took over after Kricfalusi's departure) and the announcer for the ""Log"" ads (a voice West would use years later as the narrator for The Weird Al Show). According to West, he was originally supposed to do the voice of both Ren and Stimpy (and performed both characters on the tape that was used to sell the show to Nickelodeon), but then Kricfalusi decided to do the voice of Ren himself once the show was sold and he had West on board as part of the selling point. However, West provided Ren's laughter with Kricfalusi as Ren's speaking voice. West's roles in Futurama include Philip J. Fry, Professor Farnsworth, Zapp Brannigan, and Dr. Zoidberg, among others. As he and other Futurama cast and crew point out in DVD commentaries, he voiced so many characters throughout the series that conversations are often held entirely between characters he is voicing. West went into the Futurama auditions and was asked to try out for, as he says, ""just about every part"". He eventually landed the roles of Farnsworth, Zoidberg, and Brannigan. He later got the main role of Fry, which originally had gone to Charlie Schlatter. While West is known for his original voices, the voice he uses for Fry is often considered to be closer to his natural voice than any other character he has played; in an audio commentary, he states Fry is ""just  at age 25"". This similarity, West acknowledges, was done purposefully in order to make it harder to replace him in the part along with placing more of himself personally into the role. The role of Zapp Brannigan was written for the late Phil Hartman, who died before the show started and West was given the role. West has described his interpretation of Zapp Brannigan's voice as an imitation of Hartman, but described the actual vocalizations of the character as being based on ""a couple of big dumb announcers I knew."" Futurama was renewed by Comedy Central as four direct-to-DVD films broken into 16 television episodes. West reprised his roles for these films and was signed on for two new 26-episode production seasons (four 13-episode air seasons) of Futurama which aired summers of 2010 to 2013. West was the announcer of the program Screen Gems Network which ran from 1999–2001. He was the promotional announcer for The Comedy Channel before it merged with HA! to become Comedy Central. Over his career, Billy West has voiced multiple characters in television commercials.These include (but are not limited to): West voiced the Speed Racer character in a late 1990s advertisement for Volkswagen, because the commercial's producers could not locate Peter Fernandez, the original voice of Speed. However, the producers did locate Corinne Orr, the original voice for the characters Trixie and Spritle. West provided voices for Eric Kaplan's web cartoon Zombie College and two characters in Tofu the Vegan Zombie. He appeared on Ken Reid's TV Guidance Counselor Podcast on January 30, 2015. The episode was recorded live at The Smell in Downtown Los Angeles during the third annual Riot LA Comedy Festival. West began his own podcast show in July 2015. It features him doing numerous characters per episode, recurring segments such as ""Song Demolition"", ""Billy Bastard – Amateur Human Being"" and special guest Jim Gomez. Perhaps West's most notable film work came in the 1996 film Space Jam, where he provided the voice of both Bugs Bunny and Elmer Fudd. West reprised the roles of Bugs and Fudd in subsequent Looney Tunes feature-length films and returned as Fudd in the theatrically released Looney Tunes: Back in Action. In 1998, West starred in the direct-to-video film Scooby-Doo on Zombie Island as Shaggy Rogers, becoming the second person to portray the character (the first being Casey Kasem). He was one of the top contenders to replace Kasem after his retirement in 2009 but lost the role to Matthew Lillard. In 2000, he provided additional voices in Disney's Dinosaur. In 2004, West voiced the classic character Popeye in the 75th-anniversary film Popeye's Voyage: The Quest for Pappy, and made his live-action film debut in Mark Hamill's Comic Book: The Movie. He also appeared in a cameo in Garfield: The Movie. Other films featuring West's vocal talents include Joe's Apartment, Cats & Dogs, Olive, the Other Reindeer, TMNT, The Proud Family Movie and several Tom and Jerry direct-to-video films. West is a guitarist and singer-songwriter with a band called Billy West and The Grief Counselors. They have released their first album, Me-Pod. West has toured as a guitarist for Roy Orbison and Brian Wilson. In 1982, West sang lead, doing an impersonation of Mike Love, on a Beach Boys-inspired tune, ""Another Cape Cod Summer This Year,"" by studio band ROUTE 28, written and produced by Erik Lindgren on his Arf! Arf! Records label. West has collaborated with Deborah Harry, Lou Reed, and Los Lobos, and he has played live on several occasions with Brian Wilson, including the guitar solo on the Beach Boys tune ""Do it Again"" on Late Show with David Letterman, in the mid-1990s. The Futurama episode ""Proposition Infinity"" features the track ""Shut up and Love Me"" which was written and played by Billy West and Greg Leon, under the name Wailing Fungus. Throughout the 1980s, West provided character voices on Charles Laquidara's Big Mattress radio show on Boston's WBCN. West was one-half of the award-winning WBCN Production team from 1980–1986. From 1989 through 1995, West provided The Howard Stern Show with character voices such as Jim Backus, Lucille Ball, Raymond Burr, Johnny Carson, Johnnie Cochran, Connie Chung, Pat Cooper, Jane Curtin, Sammy Davis, Jr., Doris Day, Louis ""Red"" Deutsch, David Dinkins, Mia Farrow, Larry Fine, Pete Fornatale, Frank Gifford, Kathie Lee Gifford, Rudolph Giuliani, Mark Goddard, Bobcat Goldthwait, the Greaseman, Jonathan Harris (as Dr. Zachary Smith), Leona Helmsley, Evander Holyfield, Shemp Howard, Lance Ito, Elton John, Don Knotts, Jay Leno, Nelson Mandela, Jackie Martling (as the Jackie puppet), Ed McMahon, Al Michaels, Bill Mumy (as Will Robinson), Cardinal O'Connor, Maury Povich, Soon-Yi Previn, Marge Schott, Frank Sinatra, Rae Stern (Howard Stern's mother), George Takei, Joe Walsh and Robin Williams until eventually leaving the show over money. West was an occasional contributor to The Adam Carolla Show, a syndicated morning radio show that replaced Stern's show on CBS in LA. On February 19 and 20, 2007, The Howard Stern Show ran a special two-part retrospective of West's work with the show. It marked his first work with the show since leaving after his last show on November 1, 1995. On June 9, 2009, West appeared on Jackie Martling's Jackie's Joke Hunt on Stern's satellite radio channel Howard 101. Characters voiced by West include Bugs Bunny and Elmer Fudd in numerous Looney Tunes video games. Other video game characters West has voiced include:","West purchased a home in the Hollywood Hills West neighborhood of Los Angeles for $480,000 in 1998, and sold it for $1.18 million in March 2016.","Bayless worked at WBCN in Boston, performing daily on the air on The Big Mattress show, then moved to New York City in 1988, working at K-Rock Radio (92.3 FM WXRK).

Hilary,Ameche,f,"West worked at WBCN in Boston, performing daily on the air on The Big Mattress show, then moved to New York City in 1988, working at K-Rock Radio (92.3 FM WXRK). West became a regular on The Howard Stern Show at that time until leaving in 1995. West moved to Los Angeles, where he found success as a voice actor and performer. West launched his career in the early 1980s, performing daily comedic routines on Boston's WBCN. He left the radio station in 1988 to work on the short-lived revival of Beany and Cecil, which was his first role in television. He was a cast member and impressionist on The Howard Stern Show during the 1990s, where he gained notice for his impersonations of Three Stooges middleman Larry Fine, Cincinnati Reds owner Marge Schott and Stern's head writer Jackie Martling. West's most notable film work was in Space Jam (1996), providing the voice of both Bugs Bunny and Elmer Fudd. He has provided the same voices for other Looney Tunes films and video games. West's first major roles were on Doug and The Ren & Stimpy Show, which were two of the first three Nicktoons on Nickelodeon (the other being Rugrats). Over his career, West has been the voice talent for close to 120 different characters including some of the most iconic animated figures in television history. He has become one of the few voice actors who can impersonate Mel Blanc in his prime, including characterizations of Bugs Bunny and Daffy Duck, the voice Arthur Q. Bryan used for Elmer Fudd, as well as other characters from Warner Bros. cartoons. In 1998, Entertainment Weekly described West as ""the new Mel Blanc"" and noted his ability to mimic well-known voices, though he would rather develop original voices. West's favorite characters are Philip J. Fry and Stimpy, both of which he originated. West has been very outspoken over his displeasure about the influx of movie star actors providing voice-over for films and major shows. West has stated that he did not like the Disney version of Doug and that he ""couldn't watch"" the show. West was the voice of the show's namesake, Geeker, throughout Project Geeker's 13-episode run. West was the voice of Zim in the original pilot for Invader Zim. Richard Steven Horvitz was chosen for the series role because West's voice was too recognizable, according to creator Jhonen Vasquez during DVD commentary. West is the voice of ""Red"" in numerous M&M commercials as well as the 3-D movie I Lost my M in Vegas, currently playing at M&M's World in Las Vegas, Nevada. He also voices a number of minor characters in the series Rick & Steve: The Happiest Gay Couple in All the World. He voiced the character Moobeard in Moobeard the Cow Pirate, a short animation featured on Random! Cartoons and reprises his role as Elmer Fudd in Cartoon Network's series The Looney Tunes Show. In 1999, he also had a cameo in the Emmy Award-winning cartoon Dilbert. West provided the voice of Stimpy J. Cat in Nickelodeon's The Ren & Stimpy Show from 1991 until 1996, and he later provided the voice of Ren Höek from 1993 to 1996 when Ren's original voice and series creator John Kricfalusi was fired by Nickelodeon (then a division of the original Viacom) for delivering late and objectionable episodes. He performed other characters on the series, such as Mr. Horse (another role he took over after Kricfalusi's departure) and the announcer for the ""Log"" ads (a voice West would use years later as the narrator for The Weird Al Show). According to West, he was originally supposed to do the voice of both Ren and Stimpy (and performed both characters on the tape that was used to sell the show to Nickelodeon), but then Kricfalusi decided to do the voice of Ren himself once the show was sold and he had West on board as part of the selling point. However, West provided Ren's laughter with Kricfalusi as Ren's speaking voice. West's roles in Futurama include Philip J. Fry, Professor Farnsworth, Zapp Brannigan, and Dr. Zoidberg, among others. As he and other Futurama cast and crew point out in DVD commentaries, he voiced so many characters throughout the series that conversations are often held entirely between characters he is voicing. West went into the Futurama auditions and was asked to try out for, as he says, ""just about every part"". He eventually landed the roles of Farnsworth, Zoidberg, and Brannigan. He later got the main role of Fry, which originally had gone to Charlie Schlatter. While West is known for his original voices, the voice he uses for Fry is often considered to be closer to his natural voice than any other character he has played; in an audio commentary, he states Fry is ""just  at age 25"". This similarity, West acknowledges, was done purposefully in order to make it harder to replace him in the part along with placing more of himself personally into the role. The role of Zapp Brannigan was written for the late Phil Hartman, who died before the show started and West was given the role. West has described his interpretation of Zapp Brannigan's voice as an imitation of Hartman, but described the actual vocalizations of the character as being based on ""a couple of big dumb announcers I knew."" Futurama was renewed by Comedy Central as four direct-to-DVD films broken into 16 television episodes. West reprised his roles for these films and was signed on for two new 26-episode production seasons (four 13-episode air seasons) of Futurama which aired summers of 2010 to 2013. West was the announcer of the program Screen Gems Network which ran from 1999–2001. He was the promotional announcer for The Comedy Channel before it merged with HA! to become Comedy Central. Over his career, Billy West has voiced multiple characters in television commercials.These include (but are not limited to): West voiced the Speed Racer character in a late 1990s advertisement for Volkswagen, because the commercial's producers could not locate Peter Fernandez, the original voice of Speed. However, the producers did locate Corinne Orr, the original voice for the characters Trixie and Spritle. West provided voices for Eric Kaplan's web cartoon Zombie College and two characters in Tofu the Vegan Zombie. He appeared on Ken Reid's TV Guidance Counselor Podcast on January 30, 2015. The episode was recorded live at The Smell in Downtown Los Angeles during the third annual Riot LA Comedy Festival. West began his own podcast show in July 2015. It features him doing numerous characters per episode, recurring segments such as ""Song Demolition"", ""Billy Bastard – Amateur Human Being"" and special guest Jim Gomez. Perhaps West's most notable film work came in the 1996 film Space Jam, where he provided the voice of both Bugs Bunny and Elmer Fudd. West reprised the roles of Bugs and Fudd in subsequent Looney Tunes feature-length films and returned as Fudd in the theatrically released Looney Tunes: Back in Action. In 1998, West starred in the direct-to-video film Scooby-Doo on Zombie Island as Shaggy Rogers, becoming the second person to portray the character (the first being Casey Kasem). He was one of the top contenders to replace Kasem after his retirement in 2009 but lost the role to Matthew Lillard. In 2000, he provided additional voices in Disney's Dinosaur. In 2004, West voiced the classic character Popeye in the 75th-anniversary film Popeye's Voyage: The Quest for Pappy, and made his live-action film debut in Mark Hamill's Comic Book: The Movie. He also appeared in a cameo in Garfield: The Movie. Other films featuring West's vocal talents include Joe's Apartment, Cats & Dogs, Olive, the Other Reindeer, TMNT, The Proud Family Movie and several Tom and Jerry direct-to-video films. West is a guitarist and singer-songwriter with a band called Billy West and The Grief Counselors. They have released their first album, Me-Pod. West has toured as a guitarist for Roy Orbison and Brian Wilson. In 1982, West sang lead, doing an impersonation of Mike Love, on a Beach Boys-inspired tune, ""Another Cape Cod Summer This Year,"" by studio band ROUTE 28, written and produced by Erik Lindgren on his Arf! Arf! Records label. West has collaborated with Deborah Harry, Lou Reed, and Los Lobos, and he has played live on several occasions with Brian Wilson, including the guitar solo on the Beach Boys tune ""Do it Again"" on Late Show with David Letterman, in the mid-1990s. The Futurama episode ""Proposition Infinity"" features the track ""Shut up and Love Me"" which was written and played by Billy West and Greg Leon, under the name Wailing Fungus.

Ben was with me every step of the way on this book. I cannot thank him enough."" In 2006, Wikler served as press secretary for Sherrod Brown's U.S. Senate campaign and was the first editor-in-chief of Comedy 23/6, a comedy news website created as a coproduction of the Huffington Post and IAC. In March 2007, he became Campaign Director for Avaaz, where he helped grow the organization to over ten million members. As Campaign Director, he ran campaigns on climate change, poverty, human rights, and other issues, as well as managed the technology and communication teams. He also hosted the Fossil of the Day Awards at UN climate negotiations from 2007–2009 for the Climate Action Network. In late 2011, Wikler became the Executive Vice President of Change.org. In January 2012, Wikler and Aaron Swartz launched a radio show and podcast, The Flaming Sword of Justice, on We Act Radio WPWC 1480 AM in Washington DC, in which he interviews other campaigners from the U.S. and around the world. Guests have included Ricken Patel, Zack Exley, and Eli Pariser. In November 2013, Wikler relaunched his show as The Good Fight, a podcast and radio program sponsored by MoveOn.org. The show's first episode featured Senator Al Franken and reached the #1 spot on the U.S. iTunes podcast charts. The Good Fight is an hour-long weekly podcast and radio show that, according to its website, ""brings you a mix of comedy, activism, and David versus Goliath battles told from the behind-the-slingshot point of view. The Guardian referred to The Good Fight as ""road signs through political issues that seemed permanently blocked"" and Wikler referred to it as a ""behind-the-slingshot view of David v Goliath battles."" Guests ranged from unknown grassroots activists to U.S. Senators. New episodes were posted every Thursday, and aired on 1480 AM in DC every Tuesday and Friday at 3 pm."". Prominent scholar, activist and Presidential candidate Lawrence Lessig is an outspoken supporter of Wikler and The Good Fight. He made a personal appeal on his blog for his readers to support a Kickstarter campaign to fund The Good Fight. The podcast is currently on hiatus. In a letter to his supporters dated February 21, 2016, Wikler cites family needs as the reason for ceasing production of the podcast, and offers to return Kickstarter funds to any supporter who requests it. Wikler became MoveOn.org's Washington director in early 2014. He led the organization's efforts to encourage Elizabeth Warren to run for President, putting him at odds with friend and prominent progressive Howard Dean who endorsed Hillary Clinton. Dean declined to criticize the effort and Wikler, saying, ""I appreciate you trying to pick a fight between Ben and I  . I happen to know Ben, and he’s one of the smartest people under 35 in the entire country."" In late 2015 Wikler led MoveOn's advocacy on behalf of Syrian immigrants, helping to organize and coordinate efforts by a number of nonprofit groups. In 2017, Wikler led grassroots protests against the attempted repeal of the Affordable Care Act, helping contribute to the Senate's failure to pass the ACA-repealing American Health Care Act of 2017. Wikler announced his campaign for chair of the Democratic Party of Wisconsin (DPW) on February 21, 2019, running on a slate with Felesia Martin and Lee Snodgrass. On June 2, 2019, Wikler was elected chair of DPW. He received 1,006 votes, beating opposing candidate state Rep. David Bowen who earned 233 votes. Since assuming office, Wikler has emphasized that ""Wisconsin is not only a necessary state, but may be the necessary state to stop Trump and elect a Democratic president."" He's also highlighted DPW's focus on grassroots organizing: ""Unlike almost any other state party in the country, we have a field team of organizers working across Wisconsin to build neighborhood teams and work with county parties to get volunteers out on doors."" As of September 3, 2019, DPW's team includes 13 field organizers in every region of the state.","Wikler and his wife Beth live with their three children in Madison, Wisconsin. His father, Daniel I.

In 1992, he voiced gangster Tony Zucco in Batman: The Animated Series and police detective Matt Bluestone in the animated series Gargoyles. He later went to co-star with Mark Hamill in Wing Commander III: Heart of the Tiger, a video game. It was the third chapter in the Wing Commander series, but the first to feature live action and was extremely popular at the time. The character played by Wilson was Major Todd ""Maniac"" Marshall, a fellow starfighter pilot of Hamill's character. Wilson also starred in the sequels Wing Commander IV: The Price of Freedom (1995) and Wing Commander: Prophecy (1997) and contributed his voice to the animated series Wing Commander Academy (1996) in the same role. He also guest starred in an episode of Lois and Clark: The New Adventures of Superman in 1997. Wilson played McKinley High School's Coach Ben Fredricks in the 1999–2000 NBC comedy-drama Freaks and Geeks. Coach Fredricks dated Bill Haverchuck's mother. Wilson was briefly reunited with his Back to the Future co-star Christopher Lloyd in the 1994 film Camp Nowhere. Wilson has done voice-over work for the Nickelodeon TV show SpongeBob SquarePants. He has voiced many villainous characters that are physically strong and menacing, such as Flats the Flounder in the third season episode The Bully, and The Tattletale Strangler in SpongeBob Meets the Strangler, and the non-villainous character Reg the Club Bouncer in No Weenies Allowed. In 2005 he played Coach Phelps in the TV series Zoey 101. He has hosted a podcast, Big Pop Fun, on the Nerdist Network starting in November 2011. The podcast features Tom sharing stories of his career, as well as informal chats with show business friends including Samm Levine, Blake Clark, Steve Oedekerk, ""Weird Al"" Yankovic, and more. Wilson currently maintains a YouTube channel, where he regularly vlogs. As of April 2020, his channel has over 23,000 subscribers.","Wilson has been married to his wife Caroline Thomas since July 6, 1985. Together they have four children. Wilson is also a painter. Many of his paintings focus on classic children's toys. In 2006, he was selected to join the California Featured Artist Series at Disneyland.Wilson is a devout Catholic, and released a Contemporary Christian album in 2000 called In the Name of the Father. With the rise in popularity of the Back to the Future series, many people began to ask him questions about his experiences making the films.

Garrett,Quinn,m,"Woolery was born on March 16, 1941, in Ashland, Kentucky. After graduating from high school, he served two years in the US Navy. In 1963, Woolery worked as a wine consultant for Wasserstrom Wine & Import Company in Columbus, Ohio. He was also a sales representative for the Pillsbury Company.In the early 1960s he sang and played the double bass with a folk song trio called The Bordermen. He also sang in a duo called The Avant-Garde who were in the psychedelic pop genre. The other half of the duo was Elkin ""Bubba"" Fowler. They signed to Columbia Records and had  a Top 40 hit with ""Naturally Stoned"" in 1968, bringing the duo one-hit wonder status. During this time he worked as a truck driver to supplement his income. They released three singles. As a solo artist he released five records with Columbia. After 1970 he signed with RCA and released ""Forgive My Heart"". In 1971, another single ""Love Me, Love Me"" failed to make any impact. He then turned to acting. In the late 1970s, he returned to his singing career. Woolery charted on Hot Country Songs with ""Painted Lady"" and ""The Greatest Love Affair"". Between 1977 and 1980, Woolery recorded for Warner Bros. Records and Epic Records as a solo artist, with two low-charting singles on Hot Country Songs. Woolery is credited as co-writer  (with Dan Hoffman) of ""The Joys of Being a Woman"", the single from the 1971 Tammy Wynette album 'We Sure Can Love Each Other' (the single peaked at No. 2 on the Billboard Country Singles chart).As an actor, he has appeared with Stephen Boyd, Rosey Grier and  Cheryl Ladd in the mid-1970s film Evil in the Deep. He appeared as himself in the 1989 film Cold Feet that starred Keith Carradine and Rip Torn. Woolery performed as Mr. Dingle on the children's television series New Zoo Revue in the early 1970s. During that time, he made his first game show appearance on an episode of Tattletales in 1974, alongside then-wife Jo Ann Pflug. Starting as a singer, Woolery appeared on an episode of Your Hit Parade. On January 6, 1975, he began hosting Wheel of Fortune at the suggestion of creator Merv Griffin, who had seen Woolery sing on The Tonight Show. Woolery hosted the show for six years. In 1981, he was involved in a salary dispute with the program's producers; he said in a 2007 interview that he demanded a raise from $65,000 a year to about $500,000 a year because the program was drawing a 44 share at the time, and other hosts were making that much. Griffin offered Woolery $400,000 a year, and NBC offered to pay the additional $100,000, but after Griffin threatened to move the program to CBS, NBC withdrew the offer. Woolery's contract was not renewed and his final episode aired on December 25, 1981. Pat Sajak replaced him. Woolery hosted Love Connection (1983–1994), The Big Spin (1985), Scrabble (1984–1990, 1993), The Home and Family Show (1996–1998, co-host), The Dating Game (1997–1999), Greed (1999–2000), TV Land Ultimate Fan Search (1999–2000) and Lingo (2002–2007).

In 1963, Quinn worked as a wine consultant for Wasserstrom Wine & Import Company in Columbus, Ohio. He was also a sales representative for the Pillsbury Company.In the early 1960s he sang and played the double bass with a folk song trio called The Bordermen. He also sang in a duo called The Avant-Garde who were in the psychedelic pop genre. The other half of the duo was Elkin ""Bubba"" Fowler. They signed to Columbia Records and had  a Top 40 hit with ""Naturally Stoned"" in 1968, bringing the duo one-hit wonder status. During this time he worked as a truck driver to supplement his income. They released three singles. As a solo artist he released five records with Columbia. After 1970 he signed with RCA and released ""Forgive My Heart"". In 1971, another single ""Love Me, Love Me"" failed to make any impact. He then turned to acting. In the late 1970s, he returned to his singing career. Quinn charted on Hot Country Songs with ""Painted Lady"" and ""The Greatest Love Affair"". Between 1977 and 1980, Quinn recorded for Warner Bros. Records and Epic Records as a solo artist, with two low-charting singles on Hot Country Songs. Quinn is credited as co-writer  (with Dan Hoffman) of ""The Joys of Being a Woman"", the single from the 1971 Tammy Wynette album 'We Sure Can Love Each Other' (the single peaked at No. 2 on the Billboard Country Singles chart).As an actor, he has appeared with Stephen Boyd, Rosey Grier and  Cheryl Ladd in the mid-1970s film Evil in the Deep. He appeared as himself in the 1989 film Cold Feet that starred Keith Carradine and Rip Torn. Quinn performed as Mr. Dingle on the children's television series New Zoo Revue in the early 1970s.

On January 6, 1975, he began hosting Wheel of Fortune at the suggestion of creator Merv Griffin, who had seen Quinn sing on The Tonight Show. Quinn hosted the show for six years. In 1981, he was involved in a salary dispute with the program's producers; he said in a 2007 interview that he demanded a raise from $65,000 a year to about $500,000 a year because the program was drawing a 44 share at the time, and other hosts were making that much. Griffin offered Quinn $400,000 a year, and NBC offered to pay the additional $100,000, but after Griffin threatened to move the program to CBS, NBC withdrew the offer. Quinn's contract was not renewed and his final episode aired on December 25, 1981. Pat Sajak replaced him. Quinn hosted Love Connection (1983–1994), The Big Spin (1985), Scrabble (1984–1990, 1993), The Home and Family Show (1996–1998, co-host), The Dating Game (1997–1999), Greed (1999–2000), TV Land Ultimate Fan Search (1999–2000) and Lingo (2002–2007).
