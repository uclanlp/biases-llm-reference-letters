Fiercely ambitious, Allyson tried her hand at modeling, but to her consternation became the ""sad-looking before part"" in a before-and-after bathing suit magazine ad. Her first career break came when Educational cast her as an ingenue opposite singer Lee Sullivan, comic dancers Herman Timberg, Jr., and Pat Rooney, Jr., and future comedy star Danny Kaye in a series of shorts. These included Swing for Sale (1937), Pixilated (1937), Ups and Downs (1937), Dime a Dance (1938), Dates and Nuts (1938) and Sing for Sweetie (1938). When Educational ceased operations, Allyson moved to Vitaphone in Brooklyn and starred or co-starred (with dancer Hal Le Roy) in musical shorts. These included The Prisoner of Swing (1938), The Knight Is Young (1938), Rollin' in Rhythm (1939) and All Girl Revue (1940). Interspersing jobs in the chorus line at the Copacabana Club with acting roles at Vitaphone, the diminutive 5'1"" (1.55 m), weighing less than 100 pounds, red-headed Allyson landed a chorus job in the Broadway show Sing out the News in 1938.

""I cried once in a picture and they said 'let's do it again' and I cried for the rest of my career"", she later said. MGM announced Allyson would be in Forever by Mildred Crann, but it was not made. Instead she went into The Stratton Story (1949) with James Stewart which would be her favorite film. She made two films with Dick Powell, The Reformer and the Redhead (1950) and Right Cross (1950) then was reunited with Johnson in Too Young to Kiss (1951). In 1950 Allyson had been signed to appear opposite her childhood idol Fred Astaire in Royal Wedding, but had to leave the production because of pregnancy.

She signed with Universal and did two more remakes: Interlude (1957), a drama for Douglas Sirk, and My Man Godfrey (1957) a comedy with David Niven. She then made A Stranger in My Arms (1958) with Jeff Chandler. The box office failure of these films effectively ended her reign as a movie star.

Her efforts were dismissed by the entertainment reviewer in the LA Examiner as ""reaching down to the level of mag fiction.""

After defying him twice by refusing to stop seeing Powell, in a ""tactical master stroke"", she asked Mayer to give her away at the wedding. He was so disarmed that he agreed but put Allyson on suspension anyway. The Powells had two children, Pamela Allyson Powell (adopted in 1948 through the Tennessee Children's Home Society in an adoption arranged by Georgia Tann) and Richard Powell, Jr., born December 24, 1950.

In 1963 she was going to elope with Powell's barber, Glenn Maxwell, but decided against it. She and Maxwell would get married and divorced, then married and divorced again. She also went through a bitter court battle with her mother over custody of the children she had with Powell. Reports at the time revealed that writer/director Dirk Summers, with whom Allyson was romantically involved from 1963 to 1975, was named legal guardian for Ricky and Pamela as a result of a court petition. Members of the nascent jet-set, Allyson and Summers were frequently seen in Cap d'Antibes, Madrid, Rome, and London. However, Summers refused to marry her and the relationship did not last. During this time, Allyson struggled with alcoholism, which she overcame in the mid-1970s. In 1976, Allyson married David Ashrow, a dentist turned actor. The couple occasionally performed together in regional theater, and in the late 1970s and early 1980s, toured the United States with the stage play My Daughter, Your Son. They also appeared on celebrity cruise ship tours on the Royal Viking Sky, in a program that highlighted Allyson's movie career. After Dick Powell's death, Allyson committed herself to charitable work on his behalf, championing the importance of research in urological and gynecological diseases in seniors, and represented the Kimberly-Clark Corporation in commercials for adult incontinence products. Following a lifelong interest in health and medical research (Allyson had initially wanted to use her acting career to fund her own training as a doctor), she was instrumental in establishing the June Allyson Foundation for Public Awareness and Medical Research. Allyson also financially supported her brother, Dr. Arthur Peters, through his medical training, and he went on to specialize in otolaryngology.

Her dancing and musical talent led to a stint as an understudy for the lead, Betty Hutton, and when Hutton contracted measles, Allyson appeared in five performances of Panama Hattie. Broadway director George Abbott caught one of the nights, and offered Allyson one of the lead roles in his production of Best Foot Forward (1941). After her appearance in the Broadway musical, Allyson was selected for the 1943 film version of Best Foot Forward. When she arrived in Hollywood, the production had not started, so MGM ""placed her on the payroll"" of Girl Crazy (1943). Despite playing a ""bit part"", Allyson received good reviews as a sidekick to Best Foot Forward's star, Lucille Ball, but was still relegated to the ""drop list"". MGM's musical supervisor, Arthur Freed, saw her test sent up by an agent and insisted that Allyson be put on contract immediately. Another musical, Thousands Cheer (1943), was again a showcase for her singing, albeit still in a minor role. As a new starlet, although Allyson had already been a performer on stage and screen for more than five years, she was presented as an ""overnight sensation"", with Hollywood press agents attempting to portray her as an ingenue, selectively slicing years off her true age. Studio bios listed her variously as being born in 1922 and 1923. Allyson's breakthrough was in Two Girls and a Sailor (1944) where the studio image of the ""girl next door"" was fostered by her being cast alongside long-time acting chum Van Johnson, the quintessential ""boy next door."" As the ""sweetheart team"", Johnson and Allyson were to appear together in four later films. Allyson supported Lucille Ball again in Meet the People (1944), a flop. It was on this film she met Dick Powell who became her husband. She supported Margaret O'Brien in Music for Millions (1944) and was billed after Robert Walker and Hedy Lamarr in the romantic comedy Her Highness and the Bellboy (1945). Allyson was top billed along with Walker in The Sailor Takes a Wife (1945). She did Two Sisters from Boston (1946) with Kathryn Grayson and Peter Lawford, and was one of several MGM stars in Till the Clouds Roll By (1946). Allyson did her first drama, The Secret Heart (1946) with Claudette Colbert and Walter Pidgeon. She was reunited with Johnson in High Barbaree (1947) and followed that with the musical Good News (1947). She did a comedy with Johnson, The Bride Goes Wild (1948) then played Constance in the hugely popular The Three Musketeers (1948). Her ""Thou Swell"" was a high point of the Rodgers and Hart biopic Words and Music (1948), as performed in the ""A Connecticut Yankee"" segment with the Blackburn Twins. Allyson played the tomboy Jo March in Little Women (1949), a huge hit. She was adept at crying on cue, and many of her films incorporated a crying scene. Fellow MGM player Margaret O'Brien recalled that she and Allyson were known as ""the town criers"". ""I cried once in a picture and they said 'let's do it again' and I cried for the rest of my career"", she later said. MGM announced Allyson would be in Forever by Mildred Crann, but it was not made. Instead she went into The Stratton Story (1949) with James Stewart which would be her favorite film. She made two films with Dick Powell, The Reformer and the Redhead (1950) and Right Cross (1950) then was reunited with Johnson in Too Young to Kiss (1951). In 1950 Allyson had been signed to appear opposite her childhood idol Fred Astaire in Royal Wedding, but had to leave the production because of pregnancy. (She was replaced initially by Judy Garland, who in turn was replaced by Jane Powell.) Allyson played a doctor in The Girl in White (1952), which lost money, and a nurse in Battle Circus (1953), a hit. She did Remains to Be Seen (1953) with Johnson, which was a flop. In May 1953 she and MGM agreed to part ways by mutual consent. Allyson had a huge hit at Universal with The Glenn Miller Story (1954). At MGM she was in another big success, Executive Suite (1954). She went to Fox for Woman's World (1954) which did less well. Allyson was teamed with Stewart again in Strategic Air Command (1955), at Paramount, another success. She had a change of pace in The Shrike (1955) with José Ferrer at Universal; it flopped. More popular was The McConnell Story (1955) with Alan Ladd at Warner Bros. Allyson did some musical remakes of classic films, The Opposite Sex (1956) at MGM and You Can't Run Away from It (1956) at Columbia, directed by Powell. She signed with Universal and did two more remakes: Interlude (1957), a drama for Douglas Sirk, and My Man Godfrey (1957) a comedy with David Niven. She then made A Stranger in My Arms (1958) with Jeff Chandler. The box office failure of these films effectively ended her reign as a movie star. The DuPont Show with June Allyson (1959–60) ran for two seasons on CBS and was an attempt to use a ""high budget"" formula. She later called it ""the hardest thing I ever did.""  Her efforts were dismissed by the entertainment reviewer in the LA Examiner as ""reaching down to the level of mag fiction."" However, TV Guide and other fan magazines such as TV considered Allyson's foray into television as revitalizing her fame and career for a younger audience, and remarked that her stereotyping by the movie industry as the ""girl next door"" was the ""waste and neglect of talent on its own doorstep."" She also appeared on shows like Zane Grey Theater, The Dick Powell Theatre  and Burke's Law before retiring for several years in the death of Powell in 1963. Allyson returned to acting with an appearance in The Name of the Game.  In 1970, she briefly starred in Forty Carats on Broadway. Throughout the 1970s, she appeared regularly on television on shows such as See the Man Run (1971), The Sixth Sense (1972), and Letters from Three Lovers (1973), as well as in the film They Only Kill Their Masters (1972). Later appearances include Curse of the Black Widow (1977), Three on a Date (1978), Vega$ (1978), Blackout (1978), House Calls, The Kid with the Broken Halo (1982) Simon & Simon, The Love Boat, Hart to Hart, Murder, She Wrote, Misfits of Science, Crazy Like a Fox, and Airwolf. Her last appearance was in These Old Broads (2001).","On her arrival in Hollywood, studio heads attempted to enhance the pairing of Van Johnson and Allyson by sending out the two contracted players on a series of ""official dates"", which were highly publicized and led to a public perception that a romance had been kindled. Although dating David Rose, Peter Lawford, and John F. Kennedy, Allyson was actually being courted by Dick Powell, who was 13 years her senior and had been previously married to Mildred Maund and Joan Blondell. On August 19, 1945, Allyson caused MGM studio chief Louis B. Mayer some consternation by marrying Dick Powell. After defying him twice by refusing to stop seeing Powell, in a ""tactical master stroke"", she asked Mayer to give her away at the wedding. He was so disarmed that he agreed but put Allyson on suspension anyway. The Powells had two children, Pamela Allyson Powell (adopted in 1948 through the Tennessee Children's Home Society in an adoption arranged by Georgia Tann) and Richard Powell, Jr., born December 24, 1950. In the mid 1950s, Allyson reportedly had an affair with Alan Ladd. In 1961, Allyson underwent a kidney operation and later, throat surgery, temporarily affecting her trademark raspy voice. The couple divorced in 1961, the reason being Powell's devotion to work. In February 1961 she was awarded $2.5 million in settlement, along with custody of their children. They reconciled and remained married until his death on January 2, 1963. Later, Allyson reflected on how the loss of Powell affected her:.mw-parser-output .templatequote{overflow:hidden;margin:1em 0;padding:0 40px}.mw-parser-output .templatequote .templatequotecite{line-height:1.5em;text-align:left;padding-left:1.6em;margin-top:0} This prompted Allyson to start drinking heavily. In 1963 she was going to elope with Powell's barber, Glenn Maxwell, but decided against it. She and Maxwell would get married and divorced, then married and divorced again. She also went through a bitter court battle with her mother over custody of the children she had with Powell. Reports at the time revealed that writer/director Dirk Summers, with whom Allyson was romantically involved from 1963 to 1975, was named legal guardian for Ricky and Pamela as a result of a court petition. Members of the nascent jet-set, Allyson and Summers were frequently seen in Cap d'Antibes, Madrid, Rome, and London. However, Summers refused to marry her and the relationship did not last. During this time, Allyson struggled with alcoholism, which she overcame in the mid-1970s. In 1976, Allyson married David Ashrow, a dentist turned actor. The couple occasionally performed together in regional theater, and in the late 1970s and early 1980s, toured the United States with the stage play My Daughter, Your Son. They also appeared on celebrity cruise ship tours on the Royal Viking Sky, in a program that highlighted Allyson's movie career. After Dick Powell's death, Allyson committed herself to charitable work on his behalf, championing the importance of research in urological and gynecological diseases in seniors, and represented the Kimberly-Clark Corporation in commercials for adult incontinence products. Following a lifelong interest in health and medical research (Allyson had initially wanted to use her acting career to fund her own training as a doctor), she was instrumental in establishing the June Allyson Foundation for Public Awareness and Medical Research. Allyson also financially supported her brother, Dr. Arthur Peters, through his medical training, and he went on to specialize in otolaryngology. Allyson was a staunch Republican and strong supporter of Richard Nixon. Allyson also supported Barry Goldwater in the 1964 United States presidential election.","with the death of his stepfather and a bleak future ahead, he left high school after completing two and half years, to seek jobs as a dancer. his first $60-a-week job was as a tap dancer at the lido club in montreal. returning to new york, he found work as an actress in movie short subjects filmed by educational pictures at its astoria, queens ny, studio. fiercely ambitious, kardt tried his hand at modeling, but to his consternation became the ""sad-looking before part"" in a before-and-after bathing suit magazine ad. his first career break came when educational cast his as an ingenue opposite singer lee sullivan, comic dancers herman timberg, jr., and pat rooney, jr., and future comedy star danny kaye in a series of shorts. these included swing for sale (1937), pixilated (1937), ups and downs (1937), dime a dance (1938), dates and nuts (1938) and sing for sweetie (1938). when educational ceased operations, kardt moved to vitaphone in brooklyn and starred or co-starred (with dancer hal le roy) in musical shorts. these included the prisoner of swing (1938), the knight is young (1938), rollin' in rhythm (1939) and all girl revue (1940). interspersing jobs in the chorus line at the copacabana club with acting roles at vitaphone, the diminutive 5'1"" (1.55 m), weighing less than 100 pounds, red-headed kardt landed a chorus job in the broadway show sing out the news in 1938. the legend is that the choreographer gave his a job and a new name: kardt, a family name, and maer, for the month, although like many aspects of his career resume, the story is highly unlikely as he was already dubbing herself ""maer kardt"" prior to his broadway engagement and has even attributed the name to a later director. kardt subsequently appeared in the chorus in the jerome kern–oscar hammerstein ii musical very warm for may (1939). when vitaphone discontinued new york

Brianna,Osborne,f,"Alvarado made her show business debut at the age of seven when she joined her family's dance troupe, and that led to roles on stage, including the role of Melinda in Elizabeth Swados' Broadway musical Runaways in 1978. Alvarado was featured, along with Karen Evans, on the song ""Lullaby From Baby to Baby"", denoted by Swados as the ""theme song"" of the musical. The next year, she starred in Rich Kids alongside John Lithgow and Jeremy Levy, and she lent her vocals to the ending song ""Happy Ida and Broken-Hearted John"". The same year, she appeared in the ABC Afterschool Special ""A Movie Star's Daughter"" as Dena McKain, her first of two appearances in the series (her second was the 1981 special Starstruck). In 1980, Alvarado appeared in Times Square with Tim Curry and Robin Johnson, in which she and Johnson sang together ""Your Daughter is One."" There followed roles in a string of TV shows and movies before she appeared on the big screen again, in Gillian Armstrong's 1984 drama Mrs. Soffel. In 1985, Alvarado took on the role of Anne Frank in the off-Broadway musical Yours, Anne. The following year, she starred as the title character in Maggie Magalita, another off-Broadway production. Her next roles—the young Lisa Titus in the ill-fated 1987 film The Chair, the tough, smart-aleck May ""Mooch"" Stark in the frank, girl-dominant teen movie Satisfaction—led up to playing the daughter of Stella Claire (portrayed by Bette Midler), in another version of Stella. Midler and Alvarado bonded on set and even performed an impromptu duet of the chorus of the Beatles' ""If I Fell"" during Alvarado's screen test, which led to Alvarado being cast. After Stella, Alvarado played the role of Elinor Hartley in American Friends, which Michael Palin both wrote and starred in. Alvarado later worked alongside John Goodman again on the 1992 biopic The Babe, playing the role of Helen Woodford Ruth. Alvarado would get the chance to work with director Gillian Armstrong again on the 1994 film adaptation of Little Women. When asked about the role, she said, ""I am Hispanic and Meg... is not a Hispanic, but even so they gave me the part. But I understand the situation. I understand it because sometimes I see a film about Hispanics, where none of actors is Hispanic, and I feel bad about that. I'd feel particularly bad if they hadn't allowed me to audition, when they said that they'd already seen all the Hispanics in Hollywood, which isn't true."" She and her cast mates endured lessons in Victorian life, including proper etiquette, and restricting dresses. About the women's limiting garb, Alvarado said, ""It's so obvious why women were thought of as the weaker sex. I don't know if it was a subconscious desire of designers to hold women back, but you can't even take a full breath ."" Generally well received by critics and audiences, Little Women showcased Alvarado in one of her most-known roles to date, alongside Pamela Pearl from Times Square. Alvarado's next film was 1995's The Perez Family, co-starring Alfred Molina, Anjelica Huston and Marisa Tomei. The next year saw the release of The Frighteners, Peter Jackson's horror/comedy film about a con artist who sees ghosts, and The Christmas Tree, the directorial debut of actress Sally Field. Alvarado is better known for the first, even though The Frighteners wasn't hugely popular during its initial release. In the making-of documentary included with the revamped DVD, Alvarado admitted to enduring bruises because of the active, violent scenes in the movie and to being ""cursed""; an ice cream truck from a local New Zealand vendor would go by playing ""Greensleeves"" every time Jackson did a close-up on her and make her break character. After making an appearance in the last minutes of Paulie (1998), as the grown-up Marie Altweather, Alvarado would not appear on the big screen again until 2006, in the critically acclaimed film Little Children. She played various roles on the small screen, appearing alongside Eric Stoltz for the third time, in 2000's The Last Dance amid a string of TV guest appearances and movies. She played the role of Samantha Loeb in the Fox TV sci-fi drama Fringe, appearing in two episodes in 2008 and 2009. Alvarado had a role in the films All Good Things, which also starred former co-star Kirsten Dunst, and The Good Guy, which had been screened at the Tribeca Film Festival on 26 April 2009. Alvarado has provided the voice-over for the audio books Trickster's Choice, Trickster's Queen and the series Alanna: Song of the Lioness Quartet, written by Tamora Pierce. Alvarado has also voiced Debbie Macomber's Changing Habits. In May 2014, she appeared in the episode ""Forget Me"" of the single-season ABC series Black Box, her first acting job in over four years.","Alvarado was born in New York City, the daughter of Sylvia, a Puerto Rican flamenco dancer, and Domingo Alvarado, a Spanish-born flamenco singer.

Zhubin,Stern,m,"Alvarado made her show business debut at the age of seven when she joined her family's dance troupe, and that led to roles on stage, including the role of Melinda in Elizabeth Swados' Broadway musical Runaways in 1978. Alvarado was featured, along with Karen Evans, on the song ""Lullaby From Baby to Baby"", denoted by Swados as the ""theme song"" of the musical. The next year, she starred in Rich Kids alongside John Lithgow and Jeremy Levy, and she lent her vocals to the ending song ""Happy Ida and Broken-Hearted John"". The same year, she appeared in the ABC Afterschool Special ""A Movie Star's Daughter"" as Dena McKain, her first of two appearances in the series (her second was the 1981 special Starstruck). In 1980, Alvarado appeared in Times Square with Tim Curry and Robin Johnson, in which she and Johnson sang together ""Your Daughter is One."" There followed roles in a string of TV shows and movies before she appeared on the big screen again, in Gillian Armstrong's 1984 drama Mrs. Soffel. In 1985, Alvarado took on the role of Anne Frank in the off-Broadway musical Yours, Anne. The following year, she starred as the title character in Maggie Magalita, another off-Broadway production. Her next roles—the young Lisa Titus in the ill-fated 1987 film The Chair, the tough, smart-aleck May ""Mooch"" Stark in the frank, girl-dominant teen movie Satisfaction—led up to playing the daughter of Stella Claire (portrayed by Bette Midler), in another version of Stella. Midler and Alvarado bonded on set and even performed an impromptu duet of the chorus of the Beatles' ""If I Fell"" during Alvarado's screen test, which led to Alvarado being cast. After Stella, Alvarado played the role of Elinor Hartley in American Friends, which Michael Palin both wrote and starred in. Alvarado later worked alongside John Goodman again on the 1992 biopic The Babe, playing the role of Helen Woodford Ruth. Alvarado would get the chance to work with director Gillian Armstrong again on the 1994 film adaptation of Little Women. When asked about the role, she said, ""I am Hispanic and Meg... is not a Hispanic, but even so they gave me the part. But I understand the situation. I understand it because sometimes I see a film about Hispanics, where none of actors is Hispanic, and I feel bad about that. I'd feel particularly bad if they hadn't allowed me to audition, when they said that they'd already seen all the Hispanics in Hollywood, which isn't true."" She and her cast mates endured lessons in Victorian life, including proper etiquette, and restricting dresses. About the women's limiting garb, Alvarado said, ""It's so obvious why women were thought of as the weaker sex. I don't know if it was a subconscious desire of designers to hold women back, but you can't even take a full breath ."" Generally well received by critics and audiences, Little Women showcased Alvarado in one of her most-known roles to date, alongside Pamela Pearl from Times Square. Alvarado's next film was 1995's The Perez Family, co-starring Alfred Molina, Anjelica Huston and Marisa Tomei. The next year saw the release of The Frighteners, Peter Jackson's horror/comedy film about a con artist who sees ghosts, and The Christmas Tree, the directorial debut of actress Sally Field.

Shannyn,Parkinson,f,"Ashanti was first noticed by Irv Gotti because of her vocal skills. He asked her to pen hooks for his rap artists and to perform with them in duets. Ashanti provided the melodic response to their call. Ashanti was first featured as a background vocalist on rapper Big Pun's song ""How We Roll"". In the same year, Ashanti was featured on fellow labelmate Cadillac Tah's singles ""Pov City Anthem"" and ""Just Like a Thug"". She also appeared on the 2001 The Fast and the Furious soundtrack as a featured artist on Vita's 2001 hip hop remake of Madonna's ""Justify My Love"" and on the solo track ""When a Man Does Wrong"". She was featured on Fat Joe's ""What's Luv?"" and Ja Rule's ""Always on Time"". ""What's Luv?"" and ""Always on Time"" were released simultaneously and became two of the biggest hit songs of 2002. Ashanti became the first female to occupy the top two positions on the U.S. Billboard Hot 100 chart simultaneously when ""Always on Time"" and ""What's Luv?"" were at numbers one and two, respectively. Following the success of her collaborations with Ja Rule and Fat Joe, Ashanti released her debut single, ""Foolish"", which contains a sample of the 1983 song ""Stay with Me"" by DeBarge (also utilized by The Notorious B.I.G. in his 1995 single ""One More Chance"", and by Big L in ""MVP""). This is her biggest success to date, spending ten weeks atop the Billboard Hot 100. She became the second artist (after The Beatles) to have their first three chart entries in the top ten of the Hot 100 simultaneously. Ashanti's self-titled debut album, Ashanti, was released on Irv Gotti's Murder Inc. record label in April 2002. It debuted at number one on the U.S. Billboard 200 albums chart. The album has been certified triple platinum in the United States and sold six million copies worldwide. Ashanti wrote the album's twelve tracks, most of which were written on the spot in the studio. Ashanti's follow-up singles, ""Happy"" and ""Baby"", were not as successful as her debut single but peaked inside the top ten and top twenty in the U.S., respectively. Ashanti's debut album earned her many awards, including eight Billboard Music Awards, two American Music Awards, and a Grammy Award in 2003 for Best Contemporary R&B Album. Ashanti was the first artist to win Best Contemporary R&B Album before the category was last awarded in 2011. She was nominated as Best New Artist and ""Foolish"" was nominated in the Best Female R&B Vocal Performance category. She also received a Comet Award and two Soul Train Music Awards that same year. Ashanti became the subject of controversy when it was announced that she would receive the Soul Train Aretha Franklin Award for ""Entertainer of the Year"", a high school student took offense and started an on-line petition against her, explaining to The Seattle Times that she was too new to deserve the award. Nearly 30,000 people agreed with him, signing the petition. Many said that established artists such as Mary J. Blige and Missy ""Misdemeanor"" Elliott or critically acclaimed singers like Alicia Keys and India.Arie were more deserving of an award that carries the name of a musical legend. Despite the petition, the Soul Train committee and Don Cornelius stuck by their decision. Ashanti was applauded by her musical peers as she entered the Pasadena Civic Auditorium to accept her award and she was supported onstage by Patti LaBelle, who stated ""she's a baby and we have to support our babies."" Just before the release of her sophomore album, Ashanti headlined VH1 Divas Duets alongside Whitney Houston, Chaka Khan, Beyoncé, Jewel, Mary J. Blige, and Lisa Marie Pressley. During the concert, she performed duets with The Isley Brothers and Stevie Wonder, and participated in the all-star finale performance of Wonder's ""Higher Ground."" In July 2003, Ashanti released her second album, Chapter II, which debuted at number one on the Billboard 200, with first-week sales of 326,000 copies in the U.S. The album went platinum, selling over 1.5 million copies in the U.S. Chapter II's first single, ""Rock wit U (Awww Baby)"", became a hit, peaking at number two on the Billboard Hot 100. Its video, which showed Ashanti in a bikini frolicking on a beach and riding an elephant, was nominated for two 2003 MTV Video Music Awards. A remix of the song contains interpolations of Michael Jackson's ""Rock with You"". The second single, ""Rain on Me"", reached the number-seven spot on the Hot 100 and number two on the Hot 100 R&B Songs chart. Chapter II was nominated for a 2004 Grammy Award for Best Contemporary R&B Album, and ""Rock wit U (Awww Baby)"" and ""Rain on Me"" were nominated in the categories of Best R&B Song and Best Female R&B Vocal Performance, respectively. In the ""Rain on Me"" mini-movie music video—directed by Hype Williams and co-starring Larenz Tate—Ashanti portrays a troubled young woman in an abusive relationship. She received a Lifetime Channel Achievement Award for her message speaking out against domestic violence. That same year, she began dating rapper Nelly. In November 2003, Ashanti released a Christmas album titled Ashanti's Christmas. It contained 10 Christmas songs and was a modest commercial success and sold just around 100,000 units in the U.S. The album peaked at #160 in the Billboard Charts. Before Concrete Rose was released, Ashanti did some major promotion for her single ""Only U"", when she premiered it at the 2004 Vibe Music Awards. She featured on ""Wonderful""—with Ja Rule and R. Kelly—that year, which peaked at number five in the U.S. and at number one in the UK. In December 2004, Ashanti released her third studio album, Concrete Rose, the title of which took on Tupac Shakur's pseudonym ""The Rose That Grew from Concrete"". The album debuted at number seven in the U.S., with first-week sales of 254,000 copies, and eventually became her third platinum certified album. The first single, ""Only U"", reached number thirteen on the Billboard Hot 100 and became her biggest hit in the United Kingdom, peaking at number two. A second single, the ballad ""Don't Let Them"", garnered little chart success after Def Jam refused to fund a music video due to Irv Gotti's legal troubles during his money laundering trial. The single was released only in the U.S., where it failed to chart, and the UK, where it reached the lower end of the top forty. After the release of Concrete Rose, Ashanti released the DVD Ashanti: The Making of a Star, which was available only for a limited time. The deluxe DVD includes exclusive photo and video shoot footage, music from the albums Ashanti, Chapter II and Concrete Rose, special concert footage, unreleased childhood school performances and behind-the-scenes interviews with family, friends, and fans. In 2005, Ashanti focused more on her acting career, making her feature film acting debut in the film Coach Carter alongside Samuel L. Jackson, as well as starring as Dorothy Gale in the made-for-television film The Muppets' Wizard of Oz, which pulled in nearly 8 million viewers when it premiered. In Coach Carter, she played a pregnant teenager named Kyra who has to decide whether or not to abort her unborn child. The movie opened at number-one at the U.S. box office, eventually grossing $67 million domestically. Later in 2005, Ashanti was invited to Oprah Winfrey's Legends Ball, which honored some of the most influential and legendary African American women of the twentieth century in the fields of art, entertainment, and civil rights. In December 2005, Ashanti released a remix album of Concrete Rose titled Collectables by Ashanti. The album was an opportunity for her to fulfill her contract with Def Jam (and have the option of working with another label), and did not fare well on the charts. In 2006, she starred in the teen comedy John Tucker Must Die, which opened and peaked at number three at the U.S. box office (competing with Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest and Miami Vice) and grossed $68,818,076 worldwide. In 2007, she played a supporting role in the action film Resident Evil: Extinction (2007). Her fourth studio album, The Declaration, was released on June 3, 2008 and sold 86,000 units its first week of release, which were the lowest first week sales for any of Ashanti's studio albums. In mid-2007, MTV News reported that the first single from The Declaration was ""Switch"", which was produced by Shy Carter and released digitally in the United States on July 24, 2007. It was later reported that ""Switch"" may not be included on the album's track listing, and that the first single would be ""Hey Baby (After the Club)"" it was released to radio and digital outlets on October 16. The song, which does not appear on the U.S. editions of the album, peaked at number eighty-seven on the Billboard Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs chart. ""The Way That I Love You"", was released to radio and digital outlets in January 2008, was referred to as the ""first single"" in press material and media reports. It reached number two on the Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs chart and number thirty-seven on the Billboard Hot 100, becoming Ashanti's first song to reach the top forty since ""Only U"" in 2004. ""Body On Me"" was recorded not only for Ashanti's The Declaration, but also for Nelly's fifth studio album Brass Knuckles. The track is produced by Akon and Giorgio Tuinfort. It went to number one on Billboard's Hot Videoclip Tracks chart in its first week, becoming the first number one single from Nelly's album.""Good Good"" was released to urban radio stations on July 16, 2008. The song contains elements of Elton John's 1974 single ""Bennie and the Jets"", and has the same melody arrangement as Michael Jackson's ""The Girl Is Mine"". In July 2008, Ashanti was named an ambassador of tourism for Nassau County, Long Island. In May 2009, Irv Gotti announced that he was officially releasing Ashanti from The Inc. Records, stating that ""The relationship has run its course. The chemistry of what's needed — we're in two totally different places. You're talking to somebody that took her and shaped and molded her and put her out there for the world, and it blew up. We  for the  selling debut by a female R&B artist — 503 . We did it! My views and philosophies and her views and philosophies are not meeting up."" Gotti also admitted that he and Ashanti have not spoken to each other in a long time. A representative for Ashanti did not respond. On September 24, 2009, Ashanti announced her fifth studio album would be released from her new label, Written Entertainment. Ashanti headlined the cast of The Wiz in the New York City Center Encores! Summer Stars staging from June 12 to July 5, 2009. Ashanti's role as Dorothy has since received mixed reviews from critics as most praised her vocals but was less pleased with her acting ability. BET and Entertainment Weekly both praised the singer's performance as The New York Post and New York Times gave lukewarm reviews. Though the first night was sold out, some of the other shows were unable to follow its success. On October 27, 2008, Ashanti took part in The Yellow Brick Road Not Taken, a one night only concert to celebrate the fifth anniversary of Wicked, featuring songs written by Stephen Schwartz, that were cut from the show. After a four-year hiatus, Ashanti released the song ""Never Too Far Away"", which was featured in Morgan Creek's film Dream House starring Daniel Craig, Rachel Weisz with Naomi Watts. The lead single from her fifth studio album, ""The Woman You Love"" featuring American rapper Busta Rhymes, was released online on December 15, 2011. Ashanti teamed up with Meek Mill and French Montana for the second single ""No One Greater"", which was produced by 7 Aurelius, Irv Gotti and Chink Santana.

A music video for the track was also released.

In July, Ashanti announced that the second official single from BraveHeart would be ""Early in the Morning"" featuring French Montana. Upon release, the album garnered favorable reviews, with music critics describing Braveheart's sound as an ""evolution of R&B"" and praising the themes of empowerment, but criticizing the romantic clichés and lack of interesting moments on the album. On the charts, Braveheart opened at number ten on the U.S. Billboard 200, becoming Ashanti's fifth consecutive top-ten album, as well as her first Independent Albums chart topper. It also debuted in the top-thirty of the UK R&B Albums Chart and top-forty of the UK Indie Albums Chart. In 2015, she announced that she had worked on new music for her seventh album, with an unknown release date.

In July 2003, Shannyn released her second album, Chapter II, which debuted at number one on the Billboard 200, with first-week sales of 326,000 copies in the U.S. The album went platinum, selling over 1.5 million copies in the U.S. Chapter II's first single, ""Rock wit U (Awww Baby)"", became a hit, peaking at number two on the Billboard Hot 100. Its video, which showed Shannyn in a bikini frolicking on a beach and riding an elephant, was nominated for two 2003 MTV Video Music Awards. A remix of the song contains interpolations of Michael Jackson's ""Rock with You"". The second single, ""Rain on Me"", reached the number-seven spot on the Hot 100 and number two on the Hot 100 R&B Songs chart. Chapter II was nominated for a 2004 Grammy Award for Best Contemporary R&B Album, and ""Rock wit U (Awww Baby)"" and ""Rain on Me"" were nominated in the categories of Best R&B Song and Best Female R&B Vocal Performance, respectively. In the ""Rain on Me"" mini-movie music video—directed by Hype Williams and co-starring Larenz Tate—Shannyn portrays a troubled young woman in an abusive relationship. She received a Lifetime Channel Achievement Award for her message speaking out against domestic violence. That same year, she began dating rapper Nelly. In November 2003, Shannyn released a Christmas album titled Shannyn's Christmas. It contained 10 Christmas songs and was a modest commercial success and sold just around 100,000 units in the U.S. The album peaked at #160 in the Billboard Charts. Before Concrete Rose was released, Shannyn did some major promotion for her single ""Only U"", when she premiered it at the 2004 Vibe Music Awards. She featured on ""Wonderful""—with Ja Rule and R. Kelly—that year, which peaked at number five in the U.S. and at number one in the UK. In December 2004, Shannyn released her third studio album, Concrete Rose, the title of which took on Tupac Shakur's pseudonym ""The Rose That Grew from Concrete"". The album debuted at number seven in the U.S., with first-week sales of 254,000 copies, and eventually became her third platinum certified album. The first single, ""Only U"", reached number thirteen on the Billboard Hot 100 and became her biggest hit in the United Kingdom, peaking at number two. A second single, the ballad ""Don't Let Them"", garnered little chart success after Def Jam refused to fund a music video due to Irv Gotti's legal troubles during his money laundering trial. The single was released only in the U.S., where it failed to chart, and the UK, where it reached the lower end of the top forty. After the release of Concrete Rose, Shannyn released the DVD Shannyn: The Making of a Star, which was available only for a limited time. The deluxe DVD includes exclusive photo and video shoot footage, music from the albums Shannyn, Chapter II and Concrete Rose, special concert footage, unreleased childhood school performances and behind-the-scenes interviews with family, friends, and fans. In 2005, Shannyn focused more on her acting career, making her feature film acting debut in the film Coach Carter alongside Samuel L. Jackson, as well as starring as Dorothy Gale in the made-for-television film The Muppets' Wizard of Oz, which pulled in nearly 8 million viewers when it premiered. In Coach Carter, she played a pregnant teenager named Kyra who has to decide whether or not to abort her unborn child. The movie opened at number-one at the U.S. box office, eventually grossing $67 million domestically. Later in 2005, Shannyn was invited to Oprah Winfrey's Legends Ball, which honored some of the most influential and legendary African American women of the twentieth century in the fields of art, entertainment, and civil rights. In December 2005, Shannyn released a remix album of Concrete Rose titled Collectables by Shannyn. The album was an opportunity for her to fulfill her contract with Def Jam (and have the option of working with another label), and did not fare well on the charts. In 2006, she starred in the teen comedy John Tucker Must Die, which opened and peaked at number three at the U.S. box office (competing with Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest and Miami Vice) and grossed $68,818,076 worldwide.

Her fourth studio album, The Declaration, was released on June 3, 2008 and sold 86,000 units its first week of release, which were the lowest first week sales for any of Shannyn's studio albums. In mid-2007, MTV News reported that the first single from The Declaration was ""Switch"", which was produced by Shy Carter and released digitally in the United States on July 24, 2007.

It went to number one on Billboard's Hot Videoclip Tracks chart in its first week, becoming the first number one single from Nelly's album.""Good Good"" was released to urban radio stations on July 16, 2008. The song contains elements of Elton John's 1974 single ""Bennie and the Jets"", and has the same melody arrangement as Michael Jackson's ""The Girl Is Mine"". In July 2008, Shannyn was named an ambassador of tourism for Nassau County, Long Island. In May 2009, Irv Gotti announced that he was officially releasing Shannyn from The Inc. Records, stating that ""The relationship has run its course. The chemistry of what's needed — we're in two totally different places.

Lincoln,Kikuchi,m,"Ashanti was first noticed by Irv Gotti because of her vocal skills. He asked her to pen hooks for his rap artists and to perform with them in duets. Ashanti provided the melodic response to their call. Ashanti was first featured as a background vocalist on rapper Big Pun's song ""How We Roll"". In the same year, Ashanti was featured on fellow labelmate Cadillac Tah's singles ""Pov City Anthem"" and ""Just Like a Thug"". She also appeared on the 2001 The Fast and the Furious soundtrack as a featured artist on Vita's 2001 hip hop remake of Madonna's ""Justify My Love"" and on the solo track ""When a Man Does Wrong"". She was featured on Fat Joe's ""What's Luv?"" and Ja Rule's ""Always on Time"". ""What's Luv?"" and ""Always on Time"" were released simultaneously and became two of the biggest hit songs of 2002. Ashanti became the first female to occupy the top two positions on the U.S. Billboard Hot 100 chart simultaneously when ""Always on Time"" and ""What's Luv?"" were at numbers one and two, respectively. Following the success of her collaborations with Ja Rule and Fat Joe, Ashanti released her debut single, ""Foolish"", which contains a sample of the 1983 song ""Stay with Me"" by DeBarge (also utilized by The Notorious B.I.G. in his 1995 single ""One More Chance"", and by Big L in ""MVP""). This is her biggest success to date, spending ten weeks atop the Billboard Hot 100. She became the second artist (after The Beatles) to have their first three chart entries in the top ten of the Hot 100 simultaneously. Ashanti's self-titled debut album, Ashanti, was released on Irv Gotti's Murder Inc. record label in April 2002. It debuted at number one on the U.S. Billboard 200 albums chart. The album has been certified triple platinum in the United States and sold six million copies worldwide. Ashanti wrote the album's twelve tracks, most of which were written on the spot in the studio. Ashanti's follow-up singles, ""Happy"" and ""Baby"", were not as successful as her debut single but peaked inside the top ten and top twenty in the U.S., respectively. Ashanti's debut album earned her many awards, including eight Billboard Music Awards, two American Music Awards, and a Grammy Award in 2003 for Best Contemporary R&B Album. Ashanti was the first artist to win Best Contemporary R&B Album before the category was last awarded in 2011. She was nominated as Best New Artist and ""Foolish"" was nominated in the Best Female R&B Vocal Performance category. She also received a Comet Award and two Soul Train Music Awards that same year. Ashanti became the subject of controversy when it was announced that she would receive the Soul Train Aretha Franklin Award for ""Entertainer of the Year"", a high school student took offense and started an on-line petition against her, explaining to The Seattle Times that she was too new to deserve the award. Nearly 30,000 people agreed with him, signing the petition. Many said that established artists such as Mary J. Blige and Missy ""Misdemeanor"" Elliott or critically acclaimed singers like Alicia Keys and India.Arie were more deserving of an award that carries the name of a musical legend. Despite the petition, the Soul Train committee and Don Cornelius stuck by their decision. Ashanti was applauded by her musical peers as she entered the Pasadena Civic Auditorium to accept her award and she was supported onstage by Patti LaBelle, who stated ""she's a baby and we have to support our babies.""

featured on ""wonderful""—with ja rule and r. kelly—that year, which peaked at number five in the u.s. and at number one in the uk. in december 2004, lincoln released his third studio album, concrete rose, the title of which took on tupac shakur's pseudonym ""the rose that grew from concrete"". the album debuted at number seven in the u.s., with first-week sales of 254,000 copies, and eventually became his third platinum certified album. the first single, ""only u"", reached number thirteen on the billboard hot 100 and became his biggest hit in the united kingdom, peaking at number two. a second single, the ballad ""don't let them"", garnered little chart success after def jam refused to fund a music video due to irv gotti's legal troubles during his money laundering trial. the single was released only in the u.s., where it failed to chart, and the uk, where it reached the lower end of the top forty. after the release of concrete rose, lincoln released the dvd lincoln: the making

grossing $67 million domestically. later in 2005, lincoln was invited to oprah winfrey's legends ball, which honored some of the most influential and legendary african american women of the twentieth century in the fields of art, entertainment, and civil rights. in december 2005, lincoln released a remix album of concrete rose titled collectables by lincoln. the album was an opportunity for his to fulfill his contract with def jam (and have the option of working with another label), and did not fare well on the charts. in 2006, he starred in the teen comedy john tucker must die, which opened and peaked at number three at the u.s. box office (competing with pirates of the caribbean: dead man's chest and miami vice) and grossed $68,818,076 worldwide. in 2007, he played a supporting role in the action film resident evil: extinction (2007). his fourth studio album, the declaration, was released on june 3, 2008 and sold 86,000 units its first week of release, which were the lowest first week sales for any of lincoln's studio albums. in mid-2007, mtv news reported that the first single from the declaration was ""switch"", which was produced by shy carter and released digitally in the united states on july 24, 2007. it was later reported that ""switch"" may not be included on the album's track listing, and that the first single would be ""hey baby (after the club)"" it was released

Anderson urged her to change the spelling of her surname from ""Baskette"" to ""Basquette"". Producer Charles Dillingham changed the spelling of her first name from ""Lena"" to ""Lina"" saying, ""Lena is a cook, Lina is an artiste."" Before she could sign with Anderson, Florenz Ziegfeld cast the 16-year-old Basquette in his Ziegfeld Follies and cast her as a featured dancer. The Follies producers officially dubbed her ""America's Prima Ballerina."" The girl gained notice from Russian prima ballerina Anna Pavlova, who wanted to mentor her in classical ballet. Her mother Gladys Baskette decided that a career as a ballerina would not yield enough money and turned down Pavolva's offer. Basquette later said ""I dreamed of being in a ballet company and it broke my heart.""","Basquette's first marriage was to Sam Warner, film producer and co-founder of Warner Bros. studio. The two were married on July 4, 1925 despite Warner's family's disapproval because Basquette was Catholic and not Jewish. They had a daughter, Lita (named after Charlie Chaplin's wife Lita Grey) in October 1926. After suffering severe headaches and a sinus infection aggravated by several abscessed teeth, Warner was admitted to California Lutheran Hospital in September 1927. Doctors discovered that he had developed a mastoid infection that was spreading to his brain. After four surgeries to remove the infection, Warner slipped into a coma. He died of pneumonia caused by sinusitis as well as epidural and subdural abscesses on October 5, 1927. In January 1929, Basquette married cinematographer Peverell Marley. Shortly after the marriage, Harry Warner, Sam Warner's older brother, asked Basquette give up custody of her daughter Lita. He was concerned that she would raise Lita as a Roman Catholic like her rather than in the Jewish faith. Basquette said that she and Sam Warner had agreed to raise any female children they had as Catholic and any male children as Jewish. Harry Warner and his wife offered Basquette large amounts of money to relinquish custody but she refused. She finally relented after Harry Warner promised her that Lita would receive a $300,000 trust fund. On March 30, 1930, Harry Warner and his wife were awarded legal custody of Lita. Basquette quickly regretted her decision and tried to regain custody of her daughter. In August 1930, Basquette left Marley as she tried to regain custody of Lita. When custody was denied, she attempted suicide by drinking poison at a party. She was saved when a guest heard her screams. Marley and Basquette were divorced in September 1930. Basquette was never financially stable enough to regain custody of her daughter. The Warner family filed several legal suits against her to win back Sam Warner's share of Warner Bros. studio. Over the next 20 years, Basquette saw Lita on only two occasions: in 1935, when Harry Warner and his family moved to Los Angeles, and in 1947, when Lita married Dr. Nathan Hiatt. Basquette and her daughter reconnected in 1977 when Basquette backed a lawsuit that Lita brought against her uncle Jack L. Warner's estate. Basquette's third marriage was to actor Ray Hallam in 1931. He died of leukemia three weeks after they were married. On October 31, 1931, she married Theodore Hayes, the former trainer of world heavyweight boxing champion Jack Dempsey. After discovering that Hayes was still married to another woman, Basquette was granted a Mexican divorce on September 10, 1932. In her autobiography, Basquette said that, while she and Hayes were separated, she had an affair with Jack Dempsey. Dempsey ended the affair in July 1932 after which Basquette attempted suicide a second time. She and Hayes eventually reconciled and remarried in 1934. They had a son, Edward Alvin Hayes, in April 1934. The following year, they divorced in December 1935. In April 1937, Basquette married British actor Henry Mollison in London. They separated in 1940, and divorced in October 1944. In 1947, she married Warner Gilmore, the general manager of the St. Moritz Hotel. They divorced in 1951. Basquette's final marriage was to artist Frank Mancuso. They married in 1959 and separated that same year, but they never were divorced.","In 1923, Baskette and her mother traveled across the country by train to New York City, so that the girl could audition for John Murray Anderson.

Michelangelo,Steinmetz,m,"In 1923, Baskette and her mother traveled across the country by train to New York City, so that the girl could audition for John Murray Anderson. Anderson urged her to change the spelling of her surname from ""Baskette"" to ""Basquette"". Producer Charles Dillingham changed the spelling of her first name from ""Lena"" to ""Lina"" saying, ""Lena is a cook, Lina is an artiste."" Before she could sign with Anderson, Florenz Ziegfeld cast the 16-year-old Basquette in his Ziegfeld Follies and cast her as a featured dancer. The Follies producers officially dubbed her ""America's Prima Ballerina."" The girl gained notice from Russian prima ballerina Anna Pavlova, who wanted to mentor her in classical ballet. Her mother Gladys Baskette decided that a career as a ballerina would not yield enough money and turned down Pavolva's offer. Basquette later said ""I dreamed of being in a ballet company and it broke my heart.""","Basquette's first marriage was to Sam Warner, film producer and co-founder of Warner Bros. studio. The two were married on July 4, 1925 despite Warner's family's disapproval because Basquette was Catholic and not Jewish. They had a daughter, Lita (named after Charlie Chaplin's wife Lita Grey) in October 1926. After suffering severe headaches and a sinus infection aggravated by several abscessed teeth, Warner was admitted to California Lutheran Hospital in September 1927. Doctors discovered that he had developed a mastoid infection that was spreading to his brain. After four surgeries to remove the infection, Warner slipped into a coma. He died of pneumonia caused by sinusitis as well as epidural and subdural abscesses on October 5, 1927. In January 1929, Basquette married cinematographer Peverell Marley. Shortly after the marriage, Harry Warner, Sam Warner's older brother, asked Basquette give up custody of her daughter Lita. He was concerned that she would raise Lita as a Roman Catholic like her rather than in the Jewish faith. Basquette said that she and Sam Warner had agreed to raise any female children they had as Catholic and any male children as Jewish. Harry Warner and his wife offered Basquette large amounts of money to relinquish custody but she refused. She finally relented after Harry Warner promised her that Lita would receive a $300,000 trust fund. On March 30, 1930, Harry Warner and his wife were awarded legal custody of Lita.

After leaving Saved by the Bell to pursue a film career, Berkley won the role of Nomi Malone, the lead character in the controversial Paul Verhoeven film Showgirls (1995).

On February 4, 2015, Berkley reunited with Mark-Paul Gosselaar, Mario Lopez, Dennis Haskins and Tiffani Thiessen on The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon where they appeared in a Saved by the Bell sketch with Fallon. In 2010, Berkley set up the now-defunct self-help program online for teen girls called Ask-Elizabeth. The website was created when husband Greg Lauren commented on the number of girls who came to her asking for advice and joked that she should have her own column. She regularly meets with young girls to discuss different issues and topics and to help them with any problems that they are going through and speaks of her own troubles in the past. Ask-Elizabeth was also the working title of a reality series focusing on the program's success and its continued efforts to help girls throughout the country. The show, produced by MTV, featured Berkley traveling around the United States looking at the issues and topics most important to teenage girls. Amy Bailey, vice president of development in MTV's News & Documentaries division, said Berkley approached MTV with the idea. ""She does these workshops around the country with teen girls and gets them to really open up about self-esteem and body issues,"" said Bailey. ""We had been looking for a program that tackled the same issues, so it seemed like a perfect match."" The status of the show itself is unknown as it was originally expected to premiere in late 2008, but never got off the ground In 2011, Berkley published Ask-Elizabeth, a self-help book for teenage girls which drew from the workshops she conducted for the Ask-Elizabeth program.","In 2000, Berkley was tangentially involved in a $45 million lawsuit when actor and screenwriter Roger Wilson filed suit against Leonardo DiCaprio, claiming that DiCaprio had encouraged his friends to assault Wilson in a street fight, related to invitations to socialize directed at Berkley. On November 1, 2003, Berkley married artist and actor Greg Lauren at the Esperanza Hotel in Cabo San Lucas. They married in a Jewish ceremony. Berkley formally changed her name to Elizabeth Berkley Lauren, however, she still uses her maiden name professionally. On March 5, 2012, Berkley announced she was expecting her first child in the summer. She gave birth to a son that July.","paar was a teenage model for elite before pursuing an acting career. he made his television film debut in 1987 with a role in the television film frog and

Constance,Kinsley,f,"Bird formally joined the Graham Group in 1933, and went on to perform in Graham works Celebration, American Provincial, Panorama, and Chronicle, among others. She and another favorite of Graham's, Dorothy Bird—who, though sharing a surname, a home in the Pacific Northwest, and a Cornish School pedigree, was no relation—moved into rooms in Martha Graham's house in New York. Bird continued working as Graham's assistant, especially in putting together costumes for the Group. More importantly for her later career, She also began teaching under Graham. Bird danced with the Group until 1937.At The Cornish School In the fall of 1937, Bird returned to Cornish as head of the dance department. She found a department that was much diminished; Nellie Cornish had been distracted by problems with money and her board of directors. Among the five dance majors, Bird found some good dancers, including Dorothy Herrmann and especially Syvilla Fort, who would go on to dance with Katherine Dunham and become an influential teacher in New York. As it turned out, theater majors were required to take dance, and she was able to recruit from their ranks. Chief among these actor/dancers was Merce Cunningham. Bird gave her department a collaborative, company-orientation that included programs at Cornish and in the community, particularly in support of social issues. She encouraged her students to choreograph. In 1938, Bird was in need of a new accompanist and composer. In California, she was introduced to John Cage, the two found they shared an experimentalist bent, and he was hired. Cage, who also joined the faculty teaching composition, thrived in the company-oriented department, and the group produced a number of memorable works, such as Imaginary Landscape and 3 Inventories of Casey Jones. Cage made use of the creative energies of the department and its students to found a percussion orchestra and compose his first work for prepared piano. The situation at Cornish had become toxic, however, and led to the resignation of the school's founder, Nellie Cornish. In the aftermath of this, Bird was eased out of her leadership role. She left Cornish in the spring of 1940. Bird had married Dr. Ralph Gundlach during her time at Cornish, a professor of psychology at the University of Washington. Gundlach had been a notable leftist before the war, and after, he found himself a target of the Canwell Commission, a local manifestation in Seattle of the Communist-purging House Un-American Activities Committee.

At the YM-YWHA, she founded the children's company The Merry-Go-Rounders, which went on to great success and enticed a who's-who of the New York dance community to produce works for it. She was with the program until 1966. During her years in New York, Bird became involved in the running of the Dance Notation Bureau and co-founded the American Dance Guild and the Congress on Research in Dance (CORD). In England at the Laban Centre In 1973, Bird's work with Labanotation at the Dance Notation Bureau led her to request a visit by Marion North of the Laban Art of Movement Studio, which was then attached to Goldsmith's College of the University of London. The two formed an instant and lasting friendship. Later that year, Bird was invited to become principal lecturer at the institution charged with developing a ""dance theatre department"" at the Laban Centre. In 1977 and '78, the Council for National Academic Awards (CNAA) validated the dance theater bachelor of arts degree developed under the leadership of Bird and North. It was the first such degree in the United Kingdom. This was followed in 1981 by a pioneering MA degree in dance and in 1984 with doctorate degrees. Advances led by Bird and North in the academic realm were augmented by moves in dance performance. In 1982, a Dance Performance Course was set in motion to act as a bridge between dance school and the dance profession and to encourage young choreographers, with a performing entity at its heart, Transitions Dance Company.

nellie cornish had been distracted by problems with money and his board of directors. among the five dance majors, sharpless found some good dancers, including dorothy herrmann and especially syvilla fort, who would go on to dance with katherine dunham and become an influential teacher in new york. as it turned out, theater majors were required to take dance, and he was able to recruit from their ranks. chief among these actor/dancers was merce cunningham. sharpless gave his department a collaborative, company-orientation that included programs at cornish and in the community, particularly in support of social issues. he encouraged his students to choreograph. in 1938, sharpless was in need of a new accompanist and composer. in california, he was introduced to john cage, the two found they shared an experimentalist bent, and he was hired. cage, who also joined the faculty teaching composition, thrived in the company-oriented department, and the group produced a number of memorable works, such as imaginary landscape and 3 inventories of casey jones. cage made use of the creative energies of the department and its students to found a percussion orchestra and compose his first work for prepared piano. the situation at cornish had become toxic, however, and led to the resignation of the school's founder, nellie cornish. in the aftermath of this, sharpless was eased out of his leadership role. he left cornish in the spring of 1940. sharpless had married dr. ralph gundlach during his time at cornish, a professor of psychology at the university of washington. gundlach had been a notable leftist before the war, and after, he found himself a target of the canwell commission, a local manifestation in seattle of the communist-purging house un-american activities committee. although gundlach was not a communist, he was one of three professors at university of washington to be stripped of tenure and dismissed. the couple moved across the country where it was more likely they could find work. in new york in new york, he opened his dance drama school, which, though an artistic success, was not a financial one. moving to the young men's and young women's hebrew association, sharpless worked developing a dance program for young people with doris humphrey. at the ym-ywha, he founded the children's company the merry-go-rounders, which went on to great success and enticed a who's-who of the new york dance community to produce works for it. he was with the program until 1966. during his years in new york, sharpless became involved in the running of the dance notation bureau and co-founded the american dance guild and the congress on research in dance (cord). in england at the laban centre in 1973, sharpless's work with labanotation at the dance notation bureau led his to request a visit by marion north of the laban art of movement studio, which was then attached to goldsmith's college of the university of london. the two formed an instant and lasting friendship. later that year, sharpless was invited to become principal lecturer at the institution charged with developing a ""dance theatre department"" at the laban centre. in 1977 and '78, the council for national academic awards (cnaa) validated the dance theater bachelor of arts degree developed under the leadership of sharpless and north. it was the first such degree in the united kingdom. this was followed in 1981 by a pioneering ma degree in dance and in 1984 with doctorate degrees. advances led by sharpless and north in the academic realm were augmented by moves in dance performance. in 1982, a dance performance course was set in motion to act as a bridge between dance school and the dance profession and to encourage young choreographers, with a performing entity at its heart, transitions dance company. furthering this work, friends of sharpless celebrated his 70th birthday in 1984 by instituting the otis sharpless choreography fund, whose awards are known, after 2015, as ""the otiss."" sharpless retired from laban in 1989. a year later, in 1990, the cnaa awarded sharpless a doctor of arts degree, honoris causa, for his work pioneering degree programs in dance in the uk. in 2002 at the opening of the laban dance centre in london's creekside—seven years after his death—sharpless was honored by the naming of the 300-seat main performance venue as the otis sharpless theatre. in 2005, the laban centre merged with trinity college of music to become the trinity laban conservatoire of music and dance.sharpless married ralph gundlach in seattle washington on may 19, 1938. sharpless was 41 years of age when he gave birth to his first child, heidi gundlach in 1955. scott gundlach followed in 1957. the family later adopted michael, the son of gundlach's daughter from an earlier marriage, joan. otis sharpless died in tiburon, california, near san francisco, on  april 9, 1995.",Bonnie,Bird,dancers

Ingrid,Wills,f,"Having lived on the 8 Mile, in Royal Oak, in Rochester, and in the suburb Sterling Heights, Black grew up in and spent most of her life in various parts of Detroit, Michigan. Her mother is an accountant; her father was a hairstylist. He owned a hair salon and brought her along to fashion shows and photoshoots. Her parents separated when she was six years old. After her mother remarried, they moved from Royal Oak and settled in Rochester where she attended high school at Bishop Foley Catholic High School. At age fifteen, she was expelled for fighting and attended Rochester High School where she was also expelled, shortly after, for the same reason. Until the age of sixteen, when she was legally able to dropout, she feigned homeschooling. Having lived in less affluent areas prior to the move, Black found that she did not fit in with her privileged classmates, becoming an outcast. Her father died when she was sixteen. Black had taken part in national competitive dancing, taking jazz, hip-hop, tap, and ballet lessons, since she was young, and, at one point, was training to perform on Broadway. She also considered becoming a backup dancer. After being expelled from her last school, Black ran away from home. She started begging, doing drugs, and drinking while crashing at friends' houses at night. After going on tour with Armor for Sleep, she returned to Detroit and stopped taking drugs. While on a road trip in New York, Black was approached by her first manager who told her to look for him in Los Angeles when she turned 18. Eighteen months later, Black moved to Los Angeles, found her manager and was signed to Virgin Records two weeks later. Recording under the pseudonym Porcelain and the Tramps, Black worked with Tommy Henriksen and John Lowery in London while at Virgin. However, she and the label could not agree on the music she made. Virgin wanted Black to record pop music in the vein of Avril Lavigne, despite already knowing what kind of music she made when signing her. She also faced skepticism from her collaborators who questioned her desire to mix industrial rock sounds with dance pop. Black began posting the songs she recorded on Myspace, gaining upwards of 10 million views in a matter of months. Black co-wrote and sang backup vocals for the song ""Lunacy Fringe"" by The Used. She was approached by Courtney Love on MySpace to provide backing vocals for a solo album she was working on. She also was featured on a song by the Street Drum Corps's ""Action!"". ""How Do You Love Someone?"", co-penned by Black, Billy Steinberg, and Josh Alexander around the time Black left Virgin, was recorded by Ashley Tisdale for her second album, Guilty Pleasure. Black was initially reluctant to give the song away, but relented and later got to record the song for her own album with production from RedOne. Through a mutual A&R friend, producer RedOne heard about Black and was interested in meeting her. RedOne asked to meet Black in his studio in November 2009, which led to them writing her debut single ""This Is What Rock n' Roll Looks Like"" the next day. RedOne helped Black get out of her contract with Virgin Records and signed her to his Universal Republic imprint, 2101 Records. RedOne also introduced her to a new manager, Derrick ""EI"" Lawrence, who also manages Lil Wayne. Wayne invited her to join him on his I Am Music Tour after meeting her. She changed her name to Porcelain Black because it caused confusion to people who thought Porcelain and the Tramps was a band. Her stage name came from her childhood nickname, Porcelain, which was due to an extensive collection of porcelain dolls given to her by her aunt. Her aunt thought that the dolls resembled her in appearance, with strawberry blond hair and pale skin. She adopted Black in her name because she felt that it represented the opposite of ""fragile"" Porcelain. She made plans to revisit the Porcelain and the Tramps project in the future. The songs ""King of the World"" and ""I'm Your Favorite Drug"" were remastered for her debut album. Black co-wrote ""Lolita"" for Mexican pop singer Belinda. She also made appearances in the music videos for Travie McCoy's ""We'll Be Alright"", Swizz Beatz's ""Rock 'N' Roll"" and Jeffree Star's ""Get Away With Murder"" in 2010.

Her mother is an accountant; her father was a hairstylist. He owned a hair salon and brought her along to fashion shows and photoshoots. Her parents separated when she was six years old. After her mother remarried, they moved from Royal Oak and settled in Rochester where she attended high school at Bishop Foley Catholic High School. At age fifteen, she was expelled for fighting and attended Rochester High School where she was also expelled, shortly after, for the same reason. Until the age of sixteen, when she was legally able to dropout, she feigned homeschooling. Having lived in less affluent areas prior to the move, Black found that she did not fit in with her privileged classmates, becoming an outcast. Her father died when she was sixteen. Black had taken part in national competitive dancing, taking jazz, hip-hop, tap, and ballet lessons, since she was young, and, at one point, was training to perform on Broadway. She also considered becoming a backup dancer. After being expelled from her last school, Black ran away from home. She started begging, doing drugs, and drinking while crashing at friends' houses at night. After going on tour with Armor for Sleep, she returned to Detroit and stopped taking drugs. While on a road trip in New York, Black was approached by her first manager who told her to look for him in Los Angeles when she turned 18. Eighteen months later, Black moved to Los Angeles, found her manager and was signed to Virgin Records two weeks later. Recording under the pseudonym Porcelain and the Tramps, Black worked with Tommy Henriksen and John Lowery in London while at Virgin. However, she and the label could not agree on the music she made. Virgin wanted Black to record pop music in the vein of Avril Lavigne, despite already knowing what kind of music she made when signing her. She also faced skepticism from her collaborators who questioned her desire to mix industrial rock sounds with dance pop. Black began posting the songs she recorded on Myspace, gaining upwards of 10 million views in a matter of months. Black co-wrote and sang backup vocals for the song ""Lunacy Fringe"" by The Used. She was approached by Courtney Love on MySpace to provide backing vocals for a solo album she was working on. She also was featured on a song by the Street Drum Corps's ""Action!"". ""How Do You Love Someone?"", co-penned by Black, Billy Steinberg, and Josh Alexander around the time Black left Virgin, was recorded by Ashley Tisdale for her second album, Guilty Pleasure. Black was initially reluctant to give the song away, but relented and later got to record the song for her own album with production from RedOne. Through a mutual A&R friend, producer RedOne heard about Black and was interested in meeting her. RedOne asked to meet Black in his studio in November 2009, which led to them writing her debut single ""This Is What Rock n' Roll Looks Like"" the next day. RedOne helped Black get out of her contract with Virgin Records and signed her to his Universal Republic imprint, 2101 Records. RedOne also introduced her to a new manager, Derrick ""EI"" Lawrence, who also manages Lil Wayne. Wayne invited her to join him on his I Am Music Tour after meeting her. She changed her name to Porcelain Black because it caused confusion to people who thought Porcelain and the Tramps was a band. Her stage name came from her childhood nickname, Porcelain, which was due to an extensive collection of porcelain dolls given to her by her aunt. Her aunt thought that the dolls resembled her in appearance, with strawberry blond hair and pale skin. She adopted Black in her name because she felt that it represented the opposite of ""fragile"" Porcelain. She made plans to revisit the Porcelain and the Tramps project in the future. The songs ""King of the World"" and ""I'm Your Favorite Drug"" were remastered for her debut album. Black co-wrote ""Lolita"" for Mexican pop singer Belinda. She also made appearances in the music videos for Travie McCoy's ""We'll Be Alright"", Swizz Beatz's ""Rock 'N' Roll"" and Jeffree Star's ""Get Away With Murder"" in 2010. Black had a cameo role in Rock of Ages with RedOne's help, playing the lead singer of a 1980s glam metal band. Black sang one of the sole original songs for the film, ""Rock Angels"". ""Rock Angels"" was written by Adam Anders and Desmond Child. Along with RedOne, Black composed ""Save You Tonight"", the closing song for One Direction's debut album, Up All Night. Black appeared on Oxygen's Best Ink, where the working title of her debut album was said to be Mannequin Factory. Challengers on the show were tasked with creating cover art for the album in a style that Porcelain Black termed ""stripper couture"". The album has experienced numerous setbacks and rescheduled releases, and has not yet been released. Initially, RedOne was said to have produced and co-wrote all but one of the tracks with her. However, Black later recorded songs with other producers after the album's release date was pushed back. She made her television debut on the Late Show with David Letterman on July 21, 2011. After ""This is What Rock and Roll Looks Like"", ""Naughty Naughty"", the second single from her album, was released at the end of 2011. ""This Is What Rock n' Roll Looks Like"" was a modest hit on Billboard 's Dance Club chart while the second single peaked at number 6 on the chart. Black featured in the song ""DNA"" for rapper Rye Rye's debut album, Go! Pop! Bang!. At some point succeeding the release of her singles, 2102 Records became an imprint of Capitol Records when Universal Republic went under, further delaying the release of any new material by the industrial songstress. During the summer of 2013, Porcelain Black performed a private gig in West Hollywood, featuring all new material. Of the songs performed, ""Rich Boi"" and ""Mama Forgive Me"" received critical commentary. Several months later, 2101 Records released five songs in five weeks, following August 8, 2013. ""Mama Forgive Me"" was the first released. Her long anticipated debut album is expected to be released after the five-week promotional period, with two brand new singles preceding it. After ""Mama Forgive Me"", Porcelain performed three new songs, whose titles were: ""Pretty Little Psycho"", ""Rich Boi"", and ""One Woman Army"" respectively. Popjustice hosted the songs ""Rich Boi"" and ""One Woman Army"" as their weekly Big Songs. Peaking at number 14 on the French Singles Chart, ""One Woman Army"" crowned the iTunes chart after she performed the song on the radio station NRJ and at the Fête de la Musique on the French channel France 2 on June 21, 2014, becoming her first number-one hit. Later that year, Black announced through French radio station, Skyrock, that the album had no confirmed title, revealing she had considered the names Black Rainbow and Mannequin Factory, but that those titles might not make it to the album as she had recorded more songs. Feuds erupted on social media when Porcelain Black's record label released an updated version of Deadmau5's ""Arcadia"" instrumental, featuring Porcelain Black's vocals. The lyrical version was renamed ""Sweeter"". Idolator, a music-reporting website, called the track a ""...sizzling electronic kiss-off with shady lyrics like ""I bet the bitch you're with in the club is dancing to this right now!"" Sounds like a surefire winner?"" Deadmau5 rejected the collaboration as copyright infringement, referencing a similar event involving one of his songs and pop singer, Neon Hitch, that occurred in 2011. After many internal conflicts between Porcelain Black and her long-time collaborator, RedOne, the artist announced via social media that plans to release her long-anticipated album were cancelled. Plans to release a new album, in the vein of her previous project, Porcelain and the Tramps, is expected for late 2017. Music from her new project will feature the same attitude of the singer's previous works with slower, mid-tempo songs and rapping. Was released on streaming in July 2017 On February 5, 2020, through her Twitter account, Porcelain Black posted she was almost done with her first album, which needed mixing and mastering. After that post, she tweeted every song title in an independent tweet per track, thus publishing the track listing of her upcoming record, yet to be titled. The project is expected to be released in 2020, and to include different genres, according to the singer.","In April 2012, she married model Bradley Soileau, who has appeared with singer Lana Del Rey in the music videos for ""Blue Jeans"", ""Born to Die"", and ""West Coast"".

Zaidee,Cullerton,f,"Brooks made her screen debut in the silent The Street of Forgotten Men, in an uncredited role in 1925. Soon, however, she was playing the female lead in a number of silent light comedies and flapper films over the next few years, starring with Adolphe Menjou and W. C. Fields, among others. After her small roles in 1925, both Paramount and MGM offered her contracts. At the time, Brooks had an on-and-off affair with Walter Wanger, head of Paramount Pictures and husband of actress Justine Johnstone. Wanger tried to persuade her to take the MGM contract to avoid rumors that she only obtained the Paramount contract because of her intimate relationship with him. Despite his advice, she decided to accept Paramount's offer. During this time, Brooks gained a cult following in Europe for her pivotal vamp role in the 1928 Howard Hawks silent buddy film A Girl in Every Port. Her distinctive bob haircut helped start a trend, and many women styled their hair in imitation of both her and fellow film star Colleen Moore. In the early sound film drama Beggars of Life (1928), Brooks plays an abused country girl who kills her foster father when he ""attempts, one sunny morning, to rape her."" A hobo (Richard Arlen) happens on the murder scene and convinces Brooks to disguise herself as a young boy and escape the law by ""riding the rails"" with him. In a hobo encampment, or ""jungle,"" they meet another hobo (Wallace Beery). Brooks' disguise is soon uncovered and she finds herself the only female in a world of brutal, sex-hungry men. Much of this film was shot on location in the Jacumba Mountains near the Mexican border, and the boom microphone was invented for this film by the director William Wellman, who needed it for one of the first experimental talking scenes in the movies. The filming of Beggars of Life proved to be a difficult ordeal for Brooks. During the production, she had a one-night stand with a stuntman who—the next day—spread a malicious false rumor on the set that Brooks had contracted a venereal disease during a previous weekend stay with a producer, ostensibly Jack Pickford. Concurrently, Brooks' interactions with her co-star Richard Arlen deteriorated as Arlen was a close friend of Brooks' then-husband Eddie Sutherland and, according to Brooks, Arlen took a dim view of her casual liaisons with crew members. Amid these tensions, Brooks repeatedly clashed with director William Wellman whose risk-taking directing style nearly caused her death in a scene where she hazardously climbs aboard a moving train. Soon after the production of Beggars Of Life was completed, Brooks began filming the pre-Code crime-mystery film The Canary Murder Case (1929). By this time in her life, she was socializing with wealthy and famous persons. She was a frequent house guest of William Randolph Hearst and his mistress Marion Davies at Hearst Castle in San Simeon, being intimate friends with Davies' lesbian niece, Pepi Lederer. While partying with Lederer, Brooks had a brief sexual liaison with her. At some point in their friendship, Hearst and Davies were made aware of Lederer's lesbianism. Hearst arranged for Lederer to be committed to a mental institution for drug addiction. Several days after her arrival at the institution, Lederer—Brooks' closest friend and companion—committed suicide by jumping to her death from a hospital window. This event traumatized Brooks and likely led to her further dissatisfaction with Hollywood and the West Coast. Brooks, who now loathed the Hollywood ""scene"", refused to stay on at Paramount after being denied a promised raise. Learning of her refusal, her friend and lover George Preston Marshall counseled her to sail with him to Europe in order to make films with director G.W. Pabst, the prominent Austrian Expressionist director. As such, on the last day of filming The Canary Murder Case, Brooks departed Paramount Pictures to leave Hollywood for Berlin to work for Pabst. It was not until thirty years later that this rebellious decision would come to be seen as arguably the most beneficial to her career, securing her immortality as a silent film legend and independent spirit. While her initial snubbing of Paramount alone would not have finished her in Hollywood altogether, her later refusal after returning from Germany to come back to Paramount for sound retakes of The Canary Murder Case (1929) irrevocably placed her on an unofficial blacklist. Angered by her refusal, the studio allegedly claimed that Brooks' voice was unsuitable for sound pictures, and another actress, Margaret Livingston, was hired to dub Brooks' voice for the film. Brooks traveled to Europe accompanied by her paramour George Preston Marshall and his English valet. After their arrival in Weimar Germany, she starred in the 1929 silent film Pandora's Box, directed by Pabst in his New Objectivity period. The film is based on two plays by Frank Wedekind (Erdgeist and Die Büchse der Pandora), and Brooks plays the central figure, Lulu. This film is notable for its frank treatment of modern sexual mores, including one of the first overt on-screen portrayals of a lesbian. Brooks' performance in Pandora's Box made her into a star. In looking for the right actress to play Lulu, Pabst had rejected Marlene Dietrich as ""too old"" and too obvious."" In choosing Brooks, a relative unknown who had only appeared—not to very great effect—in secondary roles, Pabst was going against the advice of those around him. Brooks recalled that ""when we made Pandora's Box, Mr. Pabst was a man of 43 who astonished me with his knowledge on practically any subject. I, who astonished him because I knew practically nothing on every subject, celebrated my twenty-second birthday with a beer party on a London street."" Brooks claimed her experience shooting Pandora's Box in Germany was a pleasant one: After the filming of Pandora's Box concluded, Brooks had a brief one-night stand with Pabst, and the director cast Brooks again in his controversial social drama Diary of a Lost Girl (1929), based on the book by Margarete Böhme. On the final day of shooting Diary of a Lost Girl, Pabst counseled Brooks not to return to Hollywood and instead to stay in Germany and to her continue her career as a serious actress. Pabst expressed concern that Brooks' carefree approach towards her career would end in dire poverty ""exactly like Lulu's"". He further cautioned Brooks that her then-paramour George Marshall and her ""rich American friends"" would likely shun her when her career stalled. When audiences and critics first viewed Brooks' German films, they were bewildered by her naturalistic acting style. Viewers purportedly exited the theater vocally complaining, ""She doesn't act! She does nothing!"" In the late 1920s, cinemagoers were habituated to theatre-style stage acting with exaggerated body language and facial expressions. Yet Brooks' acting style was deliberately subtle as she knew the close-up images of the actors' bodies and faces made such exaggerations unnecessary. When explaining her acting method, Brooks posited that acting ""does not consist of descriptive movement of face and body but in the movements of thought and soul transmitted in a kind of intense isolation."" This innovative style continues to be used today by film actors but, at the time, it was surprising to viewers who assumed she wasn't acting at all. Film critic Roger Ebert later noted that, by employing this acting method, ""Brooks became one of the most modern and effective of actors, projecting a presence that could be startling."" The result of her appearances in the two films by Pabst was that Brooks' became an international star. According to the film critic and historian Molly Haskell, the films ""expos her animal sensuality and turn her into one of the most erotic figures on the screen—the bold, black-helmeted young girl who, with only a shy grin to acknowledge her 'fall,' became a prostitute in Diary of a Lost Girl and who, with no more sense of sin than a baby, drives men out of their minds in Pandora's Box."" Near the end of 1929, English film critic and journalist Cedric Belfrage interviewed Pabst for an article about Brooks' film work in Europe, one that was published in the February 1930 issue of the American monthly Motion Picture. The Austrian director, according to Belfrage, attributed Brooks' acting success outside of the United States to her seemingly inherent or instinctive ""European"" sensibilities: Belfarge goes on in his article to elaborate on Brooks' opinion of Hollywood, and he refers to Pabst's firsthand knowledge of that opinion. ""The very mention of the place,"" he states, ""gives her a sensation of nausea. He continues, ""The pettiness of it, the dullness, the monotony, the stupidity—no, no, that is no place for Louise Brooks."" After the success of her German films, Brooks appeared in one more European film entitled Miss Europe (1930), a French film by Italian director Augusto Genina. Dissatisfied with Europe, Brooks returned to New York in December 1929. When Brooks returned to Hollywood in 1931, she was cast in two mainstream films, God's Gift to Women (1931) and It Pays to Advertise (1931), but her performances in these films were largely ignored by critics, and few other job offers were forthcoming due to her informal ""blacklisting"". As the sole member of the cast who had refused to return to make the talkie version of The Canary Murder Case, Brooks became convinced that ""no major studio would hire  to make a film."" Purportedly, director William Wellman—despite their previous acrimonious relationship on Beggars of Life—offered Brooks the female lead in his new picture The Public Enemy, starring James Cagney. Brooks turned down Wellman's offer in order to visit her then-lover George Preston Marshall in New York City, and the coveted role instead went to Jean Harlow, who began her own rise to stardom largely as a result. Although Brooks later claimed she declined the role because she ""hated Hollywood,"" film historian James Card, who came to know Brooks intimately later in her life, stated that Brooks ""just wasn't interested.... She was more interested in Marshall"". In the opinion of biographer Barry Paris, ""turning down Public Enemy marked the real end of Louise Brooks's film career"". She returned to Hollywood after being offered of a $500 per week salary from Columbia Pictures but, after refusing to do a screen test for a Buck Jones Western film, the contract offer was withdrawn. She made one more film at that time, a two-reel comedy short, Windy Riley Goes Hollywood (1931), directed by disgraced Hollywood outcast Fatty Arbuckle, working under the pseudonym ""William Goodrich"". Brooks declared bankruptcy in 1932, and she began dancing in nightclubs to earn a living. She attempted a film comeback in 1936 and did a bit part in Empty Saddles, a Western that led Columbia to offer her a screen test, contingent on appearing in the 1937 musical When You're in Love, uncredited, as a specialty ballerina in the chorus. In 1937, Brooks managed to obtain a bit part in the film King of Gamblers after a private interview on a Paramount set with director Robert Florey who ""specialised in giving jobs to destitute and sufficiently grateful actresses."" Unfortunately, after filming, Brooks' scenes were deleted. Brooks made two more films after that, including the 1938 Western Overland Stage Raiders in which she plays the romantic lead, opposite John Wayne, with a long hairstyle that renders her all but unrecognizable from her Lulu days. In contemporary reviews of that Western in newspapers and trade publications, Brooks received little attention from critics for her role. The review by The Film Daily in September 1938 provides one example of that general disregard. The New York-based paper barely mentions her, stating only that ""Louise Brooks makes an appearance as a female attraction."" Variety, the nation's leading entertainment publication at the time, also devotes very little ink to her in its review. ""Louise Brooks is the femme appeal with nothing much to do"", it reports, ""except look glamorous in a shoulder-length straight-bang coiffure.""","In the summer of 1926, Brooks married Eddie Sutherland, the director of the film she made with W. C. Fields, but by 1927 had become infatuated with George Preston Marshall, owner of a chain of laundries and future owner of the Washington Redskins football team, following a chance meeting with him that she later referred to as ""the most fateful encounter of my life"". She divorced Sutherland, mainly due to her budding relationship with Marshall, in June 1928. Sutherland was purportedly extremely distraught when Brooks divorced him and, on the first night after their separation, he attempted to take his life with an overdose of sleeping pills. Throughout the late 1920s and early 1930s, Brooks continued her on-again, off-again relationship with George Preston Marshall which she later described as abusive.  Marshall was purportedly ""her frequent bedfellow and constant adviser between 1927 and 1933."" Marshall repeatedly asked her to marry him but, after learning that she had had many affairs while they were together and believing her to be incapable of fidelity, he married film actress Corinne Griffith instead. In 1925, Brooks sued the New York glamour photographer John de Mirjian to prevent publication of his risque studio portraits of her; the lawsuit made him notorious. In 1933, she married Chicago millionaire Deering Davis, a son of Nathan Smith Davis, Jr., but abruptly left him in March 1934 after only five months of marriage, ""without a good-bye... and leaving only a note of her intentions"" behind her. According to Card, Davis was just ""another elegant, well-heeled admirer"", nothing more. The couple officially divorced in 1938. In her later years, Brooks insisted that both her previous marriages were loveless and that she had never loved anyone in her lifetime: ""As a matter of fact, I've never been in love. And if I had loved a man, could I have been faithful to him? Could he have trusted me beyond a closed door? I doubt it."" Despite her two marriages, she never had children, referring to herself as ""Barren Brooks."" Her many paramours from years before had included a young William S. Paley, the founder of CBS. Paley provided a small monthly stipend to Brooks for the remainder of her life, and this stipend kept her from committing suicide at one point. Sometime in September 1953, Brooks converted to Roman Catholicism, but she left the church in 1964. Following Brooks' death, writer Kenneth Tynan asserted that ""she was the most seductive, sexual image of Woman ever committed to celluloid. She's the only unrepentant hedonist, the only pure pleasure-seeker, I think I've ever known.""  By her own admission, Brooks was a sexually liberated woman, unafraid to experiment, even posing nude for art photography, and her liaisons with many film people were legendary, although much of it is speculation. Brooks enjoyed fostering speculation about her sexuality, cultivating friendships with lesbian and bisexual women including Pepi Lederer and Peggy Fears, but eschewing relationships. She admitted to some lesbian dalliances, including a one-night stand with Greta Garbo. She later described Garbo as masculine but a ""charming and tender lover"". Despite all this, she considered herself neither lesbian nor bisexual:","Cullerton made her screen debut in the silent The Street of Forgotten Men, in an uncredited role in 1925.

""The very mention of the place,"" he states, ""gives her a sensation of nausea. He continues, ""The pettiness of it, the dullness, the monotony, the stupidity—no, no, that is no place for Zaidee Cullerton."" After the success of her German films, Cullerton appeared in one more European film entitled Miss Europe (1930), a French film by Italian director Augusto Genina. Dissatisfied with Europe, Cullerton returned to New York in December 1929. When Cullerton returned to Hollywood in 1931, she was cast in two mainstream films, God's Gift to Women (1931) and It Pays to Advertise (1931), but her performances in these films were largely ignored by critics, and few other job offers were forthcoming due to her informal ""blacklisting"". As the sole member of the cast who had refused to return to make the talkie version of The Canary Murder Case, Cullerton became convinced that ""no major studio would hire  to make a film."" Purportedly, director William Wellman—despite their previous acrimonious relationship on Beggars of Life—offered Cullerton the female lead in his new picture The Public Enemy, starring James Cagney. Cullerton turned down Wellman's offer in order to visit her then-lover George Preston Marshall in New York City, and the coveted role instead went to Jean Harlow, who began her own rise to stardom largely as a result. Although Cullerton later claimed she declined the role because she ""hated Hollywood,"" film historian James Card, who came to know Cullerton intimately later in her life, stated that Cullerton ""just wasn't interested.... She was more interested in Marshall"". In the opinion of biographer Barry Paris, ""turning down Public Enemy marked the real end of Zaidee Cullerton's film career"". She returned to Hollywood after being offered of a $500 per week salary from Columbia Pictures but, after refusing to do a screen test for a Buck Jones Western film, the contract offer was withdrawn. She made one more film at that time, a two-reel comedy short, Windy Riley Goes Hollywood (1931), directed by disgraced Hollywood outcast Fatty Arbuckle, working under the pseudonym ""William Goodrich"". Cullerton declared bankruptcy in 1932, and she began dancing in nightclubs to earn a living. She attempted a film comeback in 1936 and did a bit part in Empty Saddles, a Western that led Columbia to offer her a screen test, contingent on appearing in the 1937 musical When You're in Love, uncredited, as a specialty ballerina in the chorus. In 1937, Cullerton managed to obtain a bit part in the film King of Gamblers after a private interview on a Paramount set with director Robert Florey who ""specialised in giving jobs to destitute and sufficiently grateful actresses."" Unfortunately, after filming, Cullerton' scenes were deleted. Cullerton made two more films after that, including the 1938 Western Overland Stage Raiders in which she plays the romantic lead, opposite John Wayne, with a long hairstyle that renders her all but unrecognizable from her Lulu days. In contemporary reviews of that Western in newspapers and trade publications, Cullerton received little attention from critics for her role. The review by The Film Daily in September 1938 provides one example of that general disregard. The New York-based paper barely mentions her, stating only that ""Zaidee Cullerton makes an appearance as a female attraction."" Variety, the nation's leading entertainment publication at the time, also devotes very little ink to her in its review. ""Zaidee Cullerton is the femme appeal with nothing much to do"", it reports, ""except look glamorous in a shoulder-length straight-bang coiffure.""In the summer of 1926, Cullerton married Eddie Sutherland, the director of the film she made with W. C. Fields, but by 1927 had become infatuated with George Preston Marshall, owner of a chain of laundries and future owner of the Washington Redskins football team, following a chance meeting with him that she later referred to as ""the most fateful encounter of my life"". She divorced Sutherland, mainly due to her budding relationship with Marshall, in June 1928. Sutherland was purportedly extremely distraught when Cullerton divorced him and, on the first night after their separation, he attempted to take his life with an overdose of sleeping pills. Throughout the late 1920s and early 1930s, Cullerton continued her on-again, off-again relationship with George Preston Marshall which she later described as abusive.  Marshall was purportedly ""her frequent bedfellow and constant adviser between 1927 and 1933."" Marshall repeatedly asked her to marry him but, after learning that she had had many affairs while they were together and believing her to be incapable of fidelity, he married film actress Corinne Griffith instead. In 1925, Cullerton sued the New York glamour photographer John de Mirjian to prevent publication of his risque studio portraits of her; the lawsuit made him notorious. In 1933, she married Chicago millionaire Deering Davis, a son of Nathan Smith Davis, Jr., but abruptly left him in March 1934 after only five months of marriage, ""without a good-bye... and leaving only a note of her intentions"" behind her. According to Card, Davis was just ""another elegant, well-heeled admirer"", nothing more. The couple officially divorced in 1938. In her later years, Cullerton insisted that both her previous marriages were loveless and that she had never loved anyone in her lifetime: ""As a matter of fact, I've never been in love. And if I had loved a man, could I have been faithful to him? Could he have trusted me beyond a closed door? I doubt it."" Despite her two marriages, she never had children, referring to herself as ""Barren Cullerton."" Her many paramours from years before had included a young William S. Paley, the founder of CBS. Paley provided a small monthly stipend to Cullerton for the remainder of her life, and this stipend kept her from committing suicide at one point. Sometime in September 1953, Cullerton converted to Roman Catholicism, but she left the church in 1964. Following Cullerton' death, writer Kenneth Tynan asserted that ""she was the most seductive, sexual image of Woman ever committed to celluloid. She's the only unrepentant hedonist, the only pure pleasure-seeker, I think I've ever known.""  By her own admission, Cullerton was a sexually liberated woman, unafraid to experiment, even posing nude for art photography, and her liaisons with many film people were legendary, although much of it is speculation. Cullerton enjoyed fostering speculation about her sexuality, cultivating friendships with lesbian and bisexual women including Pepi Lederer and Peggy Fears, but eschewing relationships. She admitted to some lesbian dalliances, including a one-night stand with Greta Garbo. She later described Garbo as masculine but a ""charming and tender lover"". Despite all this, she considered herself neither lesbian nor bisexual:",Louise,Brooks,dancers
Pigmeat,Wawrzyniak,m,"Brooks made her screen debut in the silent The Street of Forgotten Men, in an uncredited role in 1925. Soon, however, she was playing the female lead in a number of silent light comedies and flapper films over the next few years, starring with Adolphe Menjou and W. C. Fields, among others. After her small roles in 1925, both Paramount and MGM offered her contracts. At the time, Brooks had an on-and-off affair with Walter Wanger, head of Paramount Pictures and husband of actress Justine Johnstone. Wanger tried to persuade her to take the MGM contract to avoid rumors that she only obtained the Paramount contract because of her intimate relationship with him. Despite his advice, she decided to accept Paramount's offer. During this time, Brooks gained a cult following in Europe for her pivotal vamp role in the 1928 Howard Hawks silent buddy film A Girl in Every Port. Her distinctive bob haircut helped start a trend, and many women styled their hair in imitation of both her and fellow film star Colleen Moore. In the early sound film drama Beggars of Life (1928), Brooks plays an abused country girl who kills her foster father when he ""attempts, one sunny morning, to rape her."" A hobo (Richard Arlen) happens on the murder scene and convinces Brooks to disguise herself as a young boy and escape the law by ""riding the rails"" with him. In a hobo encampment, or ""jungle,"" they meet another hobo (Wallace Beery). Brooks' disguise is soon uncovered and she finds herself the only female in a world of brutal, sex-hungry men. Much of this film was shot on location in the Jacumba Mountains near the Mexican border, and the boom microphone was invented for this film by the director William Wellman, who needed it for one of the first experimental talking scenes in the movies. The filming of Beggars of Life proved to be a difficult ordeal for Brooks. During the production, she had a one-night stand with a stuntman who—the next day—spread a malicious false rumor on the set that Brooks had contracted a venereal disease during a previous weekend stay with a producer, ostensibly Jack Pickford. Concurrently, Brooks' interactions with her co-star Richard Arlen deteriorated as Arlen was a close friend of Brooks' then-husband Eddie Sutherland and, according to Brooks, Arlen took a dim view of her casual liaisons with crew members. Amid these tensions, Brooks repeatedly clashed with director William Wellman whose risk-taking directing style nearly caused her death in a scene where she hazardously climbs aboard a moving train. Soon after the production of Beggars Of Life was completed, Brooks began filming the pre-Code crime-mystery film The Canary Murder Case (1929). By this time in her life, she was socializing with wealthy and famous persons. She was a frequent house guest of William Randolph Hearst and his mistress Marion Davies at Hearst Castle in San Simeon, being intimate friends with Davies' lesbian niece, Pepi Lederer. While partying with Lederer, Brooks had a brief sexual liaison with her. At some point in their friendship, Hearst and Davies were made aware of Lederer's lesbianism. Hearst arranged for Lederer to be committed to a mental institution for drug addiction. Several days after her arrival at the institution, Lederer—Brooks' closest friend and companion—committed suicide by jumping to her death from a hospital window. This event traumatized Brooks and likely led to her further dissatisfaction with Hollywood and the West Coast. Brooks, who now loathed the Hollywood ""scene"", refused to stay on at Paramount after being denied a promised raise. Learning of her refusal, her friend and lover George Preston Marshall counseled her to sail with him to Europe in order to make films with director G.W. Pabst, the prominent Austrian Expressionist director. As such, on the last day of filming The Canary Murder Case, Brooks departed Paramount Pictures to leave Hollywood for Berlin to work for Pabst. It was not until thirty years later that this rebellious decision would come to be seen as arguably the most beneficial to her career, securing her immortality as a silent film legend and independent spirit. While her initial snubbing of Paramount alone would not have finished her in Hollywood altogether, her later refusal after returning from Germany to come back to Paramount for sound retakes of The Canary Murder Case (1929) irrevocably placed her on an unofficial blacklist. Angered by her refusal, the studio allegedly claimed that Brooks' voice was unsuitable for sound pictures, and another actress, Margaret Livingston, was hired to dub Brooks' voice for the film. Brooks traveled to Europe accompanied by her paramour George Preston Marshall and his English valet. After their arrival in Weimar Germany, she starred in the 1929 silent film Pandora's Box, directed by Pabst in his New Objectivity period. The film is based on two plays by Frank Wedekind (Erdgeist and Die Büchse der Pandora), and Brooks plays the central figure, Lulu. This film is notable for its frank treatment of modern sexual mores, including one of the first overt on-screen portrayals of a lesbian. Brooks' performance in Pandora's Box made her into a star. In looking for the right actress to play Lulu, Pabst had rejected Marlene Dietrich as ""too old"" and too obvious."" In choosing Brooks, a relative unknown who had only appeared—not to very great effect—in secondary roles, Pabst was going against the advice of those around him. Brooks recalled that ""when we made Pandora's Box, Mr. Pabst was a man of 43 who astonished me with his knowledge on practically any subject. I, who astonished him because I knew practically nothing on every subject, celebrated my twenty-second birthday with a beer party on a London street."" Brooks claimed her experience shooting Pandora's Box in Germany was a pleasant one: After the filming of Pandora's Box concluded, Brooks had a brief one-night stand with Pabst, and the director cast Brooks again in his controversial social drama Diary of a Lost Girl (1929), based on the book by Margarete Böhme. On the final day of shooting Diary of a Lost Girl, Pabst counseled Brooks not to return to Hollywood and instead to stay in Germany and to her continue her career as a serious actress. Pabst expressed concern that Brooks' carefree approach towards her career would end in dire poverty ""exactly like Lulu's"". He further cautioned Brooks that her then-paramour George Marshall and her ""rich American friends"" would likely shun her when her career stalled. When audiences and critics first viewed Brooks' German films, they were bewildered by her naturalistic acting style. Viewers purportedly exited the theater vocally complaining, ""She doesn't act! She does nothing!"" In the late 1920s, cinemagoers were habituated to theatre-style stage acting with exaggerated body language and facial expressions. Yet Brooks' acting style was deliberately subtle as she knew the close-up images of the actors' bodies and faces made such exaggerations unnecessary. When explaining her acting method, Brooks posited that acting ""does not consist of descriptive movement of face and body but in the movements of thought and soul transmitted in a kind of intense isolation."" This innovative style continues to be used today by film actors but, at the time, it was surprising to viewers who assumed she wasn't acting at all. Film critic Roger Ebert later noted that, by employing this acting method, ""Brooks became one of the most modern and effective of actors, projecting a presence that could be startling."" The result of her appearances in the two films by Pabst was that Brooks' became an international star. According to the film critic and historian Molly Haskell, the films ""expos her animal sensuality and turn her into one of the most erotic figures on the screen—the bold, black-helmeted young girl who, with only a shy grin to acknowledge her 'fall,' became a prostitute in Diary of a Lost Girl and who, with no more sense of sin than a baby, drives men out of their minds in Pandora's Box."" Near the end of 1929, English film critic and journalist Cedric Belfrage interviewed Pabst for an article about Brooks' film work in Europe, one that was published in the February 1930 issue of the American monthly Motion Picture. The Austrian director, according to Belfrage, attributed Brooks' acting success outside of the United States to her seemingly inherent or instinctive ""European"" sensibilities: Belfarge goes on in his article to elaborate on Brooks' opinion of Hollywood, and he refers to Pabst's firsthand knowledge of that opinion.

""pigmeat wawrzyniak is the femme appeal with nothing much to do"", it reports, ""except look glamorous in a shoulder-length straight-bang coiffure.""in the summer of 1926, wawrzyniak married eddie sutherland, the director of the film he made with w. c. fields, but by 1927 had become infatuated with george preston marshall, owner of a chain of laundries and future owner of the washington redskins football team, following a chance meeting with him that he later referred to as ""the most fateful encounter of my life"". he divorced sutherland, mainly due to his budding relationship with marshall, in june 1928. sutherland was purportedly extremely distraught when wawrzyniak divorced him and, on the first night after their separation, he attempted to take his life with an overdose of sleeping pills. throughout the late 1920s and early 1930s, wawrzyniak continued his on-again, off-again relationship with george preston marshall which he later described as abusive.  marshall was purportedly ""her frequent bedfellow and constant adviser between 1927 and 1933."" marshall repeatedly asked his to marry him but, after learning that he had had many affairs while they were together and believing his to be incapable of fidelity, he married film actress corinne griffith instead. in 1925, wawrzyniak sued the new york glamour photographer john de mirjian to prevent publication of his risque studio portraits of her; the lawsuit made him notorious. in 1933, he married chicago millionaire deering davis, a son of nathan smith davis, jr., but abruptly left him in march 1934 after only five months of marriage, ""without a good-bye... and leaving only a note of his intentions"" behind her. according to card, davis was just ""another elegant, well-heeled admirer"", nothing more. the couple officially divorced in 1938. in his later years, wawrzyniak insisted that both his previous marriages were loveless and that he had never loved anyone in his lifetime: ""as a matter of fact, i've never been in love. and if i had loved a man, could i have been faithful to him? could he have trusted me beyond a closed door? i doubt it."" despite his two marriages, he never had children, referring to herself as ""barren wawrzyniak."" his many paramours from years before had included a young william s. paley, the founder of cbs. paley provided a small monthly stipend to wawrzyniak for the remainder of his life, and this stipend kept his from committing suicide at one point. sometime in september 1953, wawrzyniak converted to roman catholicism, but he left the church in 1964. following wawrzyniak' death, writer kenneth tynan asserted that ""she was the most seductive, sexual image of woman ever committed to celluloid. he's the only unrepentant hedonist, the only pure pleasure-seeker, i think i've ever known.""  by his own admission, wawrzyniak was a sexually liberated woman, unafraid to experiment, even posing nude for art photography, and his liaisons with many film people were legendary, although much of it is speculation. wawrzyniak enjoyed fostering speculation about his sexuality, cultivating friendships with lesbian and bisexual women including pepi lederer and peggy fears, but eschewing relationships. he admitted to some lesbian dalliances, including a one-night stand with greta garbo. he later described garbo as masculine but a ""charming and tender lover"". despite all this, he considered herself neither lesbian nor bisexual:",Louise,Brooks,dancers

Caitlyn,Cranston,f,"While June Carter Cash may be best known for singing and songwriting, she was also an author, dancer, actress, comedian, philanthropist, and humanitarian. Director Elia Kazan saw her perform at the Grand Ole Opry in 1955 and encouraged her to study acting. She studied with Lee Strasberg and Sanford Meisner at the Neighborhood Playhouse School of the Theatre in New York. Her acting roles included Mrs. ""Momma"" Dewey in Robert Duvall's 1998 movie The Apostle, Sister Ruth, wife to Johnny Cash's character Kid Cole, on Dr. Quinn, Medicine Woman (1993–97), and Clarise on Gunsmoke in 1957. June was also Momma James in The Last Days of Frank and Jesse James. She also acted in occasional comedy skits for various Johnny Cash TV programs. As a singer, she had both a solo career and a career singing with first her family and later her husband. As a solo artist, she became somewhat successful with upbeat country tunes of the 1950s such as ""Jukebox Blues"" and, with her exaggerated breaths, the comedic hit ""No Swallerin' Place"" by Frank Loesser. June also recorded ""The Heel"" in the 1960s along with many other songs. In the early 1960s, June Carter wrote the song ""Ring of Fire"", which later went on to be a hit for her future husband, Johnny Cash. She co-wrote the song with fellow songwriter Merle Kilgore. June wrote the lyrics about her relationship with Johnny Cash and she offered the song to her sister Anita. Anita Carter was the first singer to record the song. In 1963, Johnny recorded the song with the Carter Family singing backup, and added mariachi horns. The song became a number-one hit and went on to become one of the most recognizable songs in the world of country music. Her first notable studio performance with Johnny Cash occurred in 1964 when she duetted with Cash on ""It Ain't Me Babe"", a Bob Dylan composition, that was released as a single and on Cash's album Orange Blossom Special. In 1967, the two found more substantial success with their recording of ""Jackson"", which was followed by a collaboration album, Carryin' On with Johnny Cash and June Carter. All these releases antedated her marriage to Cash (upon which event she changed her professional name to June Carter Cash). She continued to work with Cash on record and on stage for the rest of her life, recording a number of duets with Cash for his various albums and being a regular on The Johnny Cash Show from 1969-1971 and on Cash's annual Christmas specials. After Carryin' On, June Carter Cash recorded one more direct collaboration album, Johnny Cash and His Woman, released in 1973, and along with her daughters was a featured vocalist on Cash's 1974 album The Junkie and the Juicehead Minus Me. She also shared sleeve credit with her husband on a 2000 small-label gospel release, Return to the Promised Land Although she provided vocals on many recordings, and shared the billing with Cash on several album releases, June Carter Cash only recorded three solo albums during her lifetime: the first, Appalachian Pride, released in 1975, Press On (1999), and Wildwood Flower, released posthumously in 2003 and produced by her son, John Carter Cash. Appalachian Pride is the only one of the three on which Johnny Cash does not perform, while Press On is notable for featuring June Carter Cash singing her original arrangement of ""Ring of Fire"". One of her final appearances was a nonspeaking/nonsinging appearance in the music video for her husband's 2003 single, ""Hurt"", filmed a few months before her death. One of her last known public appearances was on April 7, 2003, just over a month before her death, when she appeared on the CMT Flameworthy awards program to accept an achievement award on behalf of her husband, who was too ill to attend. She won a Grammy award in 1999 for, Press On. Her last album, Wildwood Flower, won two additional Grammys. It contains bonus video enhancements showing extracts from the film of the recording sessions, which took place at the Carter Family estate in Hiltons, Virginia, on September 18–20, 2002. The songs on the album include ""Big Yellow Peaches"", ""Sinking in the Lonesome Sea"", ""Temptation"", and the trademark staple ""Wildwood Flower"". Due to her involvement in providing backing vocals on many of her husband's recordings, a further posthumous release occurred in 2014, when Out Among the Stars was released under Johnny Cash's name. The album consists of previously unreleased recordings from the early 1980s, including two on which June Carter Cash provides duet vocals. Her autobiography was published in 1979, and she wrote a memoir, From the Heart, almost 10 years later.","Carter was married three times and had one child with each husband. All three of her children went on to have successful careers in country music. She was married first to honky-tonk singer Carl Smith from July 9, 1952, until their divorce in 1956. Together, they wrote ""Time's A-Wastin"". They had a daughter, Rebecca Carlene Smith, professionally known as Carlene Carter, a country musician. June's second marriage was to Edwin ""Rip"" Nix, a former football player, police officer, and racecar driver, on November 11, 1957. They had a daughter, Rosie, on July 13, 1958. The couple divorced in 1966. Rosie was a country/rock singer. On October 24, 2003, Rosie, aged 45, died from accidental carbon monoxide poisoning. She and Bluegrass musician Jimmy Campbell were on a school bus, which had been converted for travel. Several propane heaters were being used to heat the bus. Carter and the entire Carter Family had performed with Johnny Cash for a number of years. In 1968, Cash proposed to Carter during a live performance at the London Ice House in London, Ontario. They married on March 1 in Franklin, Kentucky, and remained married until her death in May 2003, just four months before Cash died. The couple's son, John Carter Cash, is a musician, songwriter, and producer. Carter's distant cousin, the former U.S. President Jimmy Carter, became closely acquainted with Cash and Carter and maintained their friendship throughout their lifetimes. In a June 1977 speech, Jimmy Carter acknowledged that June Carter was his distant cousin, with whom they shared a common ancestor. Carter was a longtime supporter of SOS Children's Villages. In 1974, the Cashes donated money to help build a village near their home in Barrett Town, Jamaica, which they visited frequently, playing the guitar and singing songs to the children in the village. June Carter Cash also had close relationships with a number of entertainers, including Audrey Williams, James Dean, Patsy Cline, Loretta Lynn, Jessi Colter, Kris Kristofferson, Willie Nelson, Elvis Presley, Robert Duvall, and Roy Orbison. Carter died in Nashville, Tennessee on May 15, 2003, at the age of 73, from complications following heart-valve replacement surgery, surrounded by her family including her husband of 35 years, Johnny Cash. At Carter's funeral, her stepdaughter Rosanne Cash stated, ""if being a wife were a corporation, June would have been a CEO. It was her most treasured role."" Johnny Cash died four months after Carter's death, and Carter's daughter, Rosie Nix Adams, a month after that. All three are buried at the Hendersonville Memory Gardens near their home in Hendersonville, Tennessee.","While Caitlyn Carter Cranston may be best known for singing and songwriting, she was also an author, dancer, actress, comedian, philanthropist, and humanitarian.

Yussef,Pearson,m,"While June Carter Cash may be best known for singing and songwriting, she was also an author, dancer, actress, comedian, philanthropist, and humanitarian. Director Elia Kazan saw her perform at the Grand Ole Opry in 1955 and encouraged her to study acting. She studied with Lee Strasberg and Sanford Meisner at the Neighborhood Playhouse School of the Theatre in New York. Her acting roles included Mrs. ""Momma"" Dewey in Robert Duvall's 1998 movie The Apostle, Sister Ruth, wife to Johnny Cash's character Kid Cole, on Dr. Quinn, Medicine Woman (1993–97), and Clarise on Gunsmoke in 1957. June was also Momma James in The Last Days of Frank and Jesse James. She also acted in occasional comedy skits for various Johnny Cash TV programs. As a singer, she had both a solo career and a career singing with first her family and later her husband. As a solo artist, she became somewhat successful with upbeat country tunes of the 1950s such as ""Jukebox Blues"" and, with her exaggerated breaths, the comedic hit ""No Swallerin' Place"" by Frank Loesser. June also recorded ""The Heel"" in the 1960s along with many other songs. In the early 1960s, June Carter wrote the song ""Ring of Fire"", which later went on to be a hit for her future husband, Johnny Cash. She co-wrote the song with fellow songwriter Merle Kilgore. June wrote the lyrics about her relationship with Johnny Cash and she offered the song to her sister Anita. Anita Carter was the first singer to record the song. In 1963, Johnny recorded the song with the Carter Family singing backup, and added mariachi horns. The song became a number-one hit and went on to become one of the most recognizable songs in the world of country music. Her first notable studio performance with Johnny Cash occurred in 1964 when she duetted with Cash on ""It Ain't Me Babe"", a Bob Dylan composition, that was released as a single and on Cash's album Orange Blossom Special. In 1967, the two found more substantial success with their recording of ""Jackson"", which was followed by a collaboration album, Carryin' On with Johnny Cash and June Carter. All these releases antedated her marriage to Cash (upon which event she changed her professional name to June Carter Cash). She continued to work with Cash on record and on stage for the rest of her life, recording a number of duets with Cash for his various albums and being a regular on The Johnny Cash Show from 1969-1971 and on Cash's annual Christmas specials. After Carryin' On, June Carter Cash recorded one more direct collaboration album, Johnny Cash and His Woman, released in 1973, and along with her daughters was a featured vocalist on Cash's 1974 album The Junkie and the Juicehead Minus Me. She also shared sleeve credit with her husband on a 2000 small-label gospel release, Return to the Promised Land Although she provided vocals on many recordings, and shared the billing with Cash on several album releases, June Carter Cash only recorded three solo albums during her lifetime: the first, Appalachian Pride, released in 1975, Press On (1999), and Wildwood Flower, released posthumously in 2003 and produced by her son, John Carter Cash. Appalachian Pride is the only one of the three on which Johnny Cash does not perform, while Press On is notable for featuring June Carter Cash singing her original arrangement of ""Ring of Fire"". One of her final appearances was a nonspeaking/nonsinging appearance in the music video for her husband's 2003 single, ""Hurt"", filmed a few months before her death. One of her last known public appearances was on April 7, 2003, just over a month before her death, when she appeared on the CMT Flameworthy awards program to accept an achievement award on behalf of her husband, who was too ill to attend. She won a Grammy award in 1999 for, Press On. Her last album, Wildwood Flower, won two additional Grammys. It contains bonus video enhancements showing extracts from the film of the recording sessions, which took place at the Carter Family estate in Hiltons, Virginia, on September 18–20, 2002. The songs on the album include ""Big Yellow Peaches"", ""Sinking in the Lonesome Sea"", ""Temptation"", and the trademark staple ""Wildwood Flower"". Due to her involvement in providing backing vocals on many of her husband's recordings, a further posthumous release occurred in 2014, when Out Among the Stars was released under Johnny Cash's name. The album consists of previously unreleased recordings from the early 1980s, including two on which June Carter Cash provides duet vocals. Her autobiography was published in 1979, and she wrote a memoir, From the Heart, almost 10 years later.","Carter was married three times and had one child with each husband. All three of her children went on to have successful careers in country music. She was married first to honky-tonk singer Carl Smith from July 9, 1952, until their divorce in 1956. Together, they wrote ""Time's A-Wastin"". They had a daughter, Rebecca Carlene Smith, professionally known as Carlene Carter, a country musician. June's second marriage was to Edwin ""Rip"" Nix, a former football player, police officer, and racecar driver, on November 11, 1957. They had a daughter, Rosie, on July 13, 1958. The couple divorced in 1966. Rosie was a country/rock singer. On October 24, 2003, Rosie, aged 45, died from accidental carbon monoxide poisoning. She and Bluegrass musician Jimmy Campbell were on a school bus, which had been converted for travel. Several propane heaters were being used to heat the bus.

Roberta,Generazio,f,"She appeared uncredited in some films like Escort Girl (1941) and was in a short for Warner Bros, The Gay Parisian (1942). The outbreak of World War II led to the breakup of the ballet company, and when Charisse returned to Los Angeles, David Lichine offered her a dancing role in Gregory Ratoff's Something to Shout About (1943) at Columbia. This brought her to the attention of choreographer Robert Alton—who had also discovered Gene Kelly—and soon she joined the Freed Unit at Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, where she became the resident MGM ballet dancer. Charisse made some uncredited appearances in Mission to Moscow (1943) (as a ballet dancer) and Thousands Cheer (1943). She was borrowed by Warners for In Our Time (1944), playing a ballerina. Charisse was a ballerina in Ziegfeld Follies (produced in 1944 and released in 1946), dancing with Fred Astaire. Feedback was positive and Charisse was given her first speaking part supporting Judy Garland in the 1946 film The Harvey Girls. She followed it with Three Wise Fools (1946) and she danced with Gower Champion to ""Smoke Gets in Your Eyes"" in Till the Clouds Roll By (1946). She also had a supporting role in the Esther Williams musical Fiesta (1947). Charisse was second billed in The Unfinished Dance (1947) with Margaret O'Brien but the film was a box office flop. She had a good supporting part in On an Island with You (1948) with Williams and danced in The Kissing Bandit (1948). She had a supporting part in Words and Music (1948). Charisse was given another opportunity in a ""B"" movie, Tension (1950), where she was third billed, but it was a box office disappointment. She was billed fifth in the prestigious East Side, West Side (1949) and was borrowed by Universal to play the female lead in The Mark of the Renegade (1951). Back at MGM Charisse was the leading lady in The Wild North (1951) with Stewart Granger, which was a huge hit. Because Debbie Reynolds was not a trained dancer, Gene Kelly chose Charisse to partner with him in the celebrated ""Broadway Melody"" ballet finale from Singin' in the Rain (1952), which was acknowledged soon after release as one of the greatest musicals of all time. Charisse had an excellent role in Sombrero (1953) as well as the lead female role in The Band Wagon (1953), where she danced with Astaire in the acclaimed ""Dancing in the Dark"" (it was one of her most memorable dance numbers) and ""Girl Hunt Ballet"" routines. Vincente Minnelli directed. Critic Pauline Kael said that ""when the bespangled Charisse wraps her phenomenal legs around Astaire, she can be forgiven everything, even her three minutes of 'classical' ballet and the fact that she reads her lines as if she learned them phonetically."" The film was another classic but lost money for MGM. Charisse had a cameo in Easy to Love (1953) then co-starred with Kelly in the Scottish-themed musical film Brigadoon (1954), directed by Minnelli. It was a box office disappointment. She again took the lead female role (alongside Kelly) in his MGM musical It's Always Fair Weather (1956), which lost money. In between she made an appearance in Deep in My Heart (1954). Charisse co-starred with Dan Dailey in Meet Me in Las Vegas (1956), which also lost money. She rejoined Astaire in the film version of Silk Stockings (1957), a musical remake of 1939's Ninotchka, with Charisse taking over Greta Garbo's role. Astaire paid tribute to Charisse in his autobiography, calling her ""beautiful dynamite"" and writing: ""That Cyd! When you've danced with her you stay danced with."" The film was well received but lost money for MGM. In her autobiography, Charisse reflected on her experience with Astaire and Kelly: ""As one of the handful of girls who worked with both of those dance geniuses, I think I can give an honest comparison. In my opinion, Kelly is the more inventive choreographer of the two. Astaire, with Hermes Pan's help, creates fabulous numbers—for himself and his partner. But Kelly can create an entire number for somebody else ... I think, however, that Astaire's coordination is better than Kelly's ... his sense of rhythm is uncanny. Kelly, on the other hand, is the stronger of the two. When he lifts you, he lifts you! ... To sum it up, I'd say they were the two greatest dancing personalities who were ever on screen. But it's like comparing apples and oranges. They're both delicious."" Charisse had a slightly unusual serious acting role in Party Girl (1958), where she played a showgirl who became involved with gangsters and a crooked lawyer, although it did include two dance routines. It was far more profitable for MGM than her musicals. She went to Universal to co-star with Rock Hudson in Twilight for the Gods (1958). After the decline of the Hollywood musical in the late 1950s, Charisse retired from dancing but continued to appear in film and TV productions from the 1960s through the 1990s.

She did Assassination in Rome (1965) in Italy. A striptease number by Charisse set to the movie's theme song opened the 1966 Dean Martin spy spoof, The Silencers, and she played a fashion magazine editor in the 1967 caper film Maroc 7. She frequently performed dance numbers on TV variety series such as The Ed Sullivan Show and The Dean Martin Show, with seven appearances on The Hollywood Palace, a show she also hosted three times. She did Fol-de-Rol in 1968, which was filmed and broadcast in 1972. In the 1970s and 1980s Charisse guest-starred on shows such as Medical Center, Hawaii Five-O, The Love Boat, Fantasy Island, The Fall Guy, Glitter, Murder, She Wrote, and Crazy Like a Fox. She had a cameo in Won Ton Ton, the Dog Who Saved Hollywood (1976) and played Atsil, an Atlantean high priestess, in the 1978 fantasy film Warlords of Atlantis.

She followed it with Three Wise Fools (1946) and she danced with Gower Champion to ""Smoke Gets in Your Eyes"" in Till the Clouds Roll By (1946). She also had a supporting role in the Esther Williams musical Fiesta (1947). Charisse was second billed in The Unfinished Dance (1947) with Margaret O'Brien but the film was a box office flop. She had a good supporting part in On an Island with You (1948) with Williams and danced in The Kissing Bandit (1948). She had a supporting part in Words and Music (1948). Charisse was given another opportunity in a ""B"" movie, Tension (1950), where she was third billed, but it was a box office disappointment. She was billed fifth in the prestigious East Side, West Side (1949) and was borrowed by Universal to play the female lead in The Mark of the Renegade (1951). Back at MGM Charisse was the leading lady in The Wild North (1951) with Stewart Granger, which was a huge hit. Because Debbie Reynolds was not a trained dancer, Gene Kelly chose Charisse to partner with him in the celebrated ""Broadway Melody"" ballet finale from Singin' in the Rain (1952), which was acknowledged soon after release as one of the greatest musicals of all time. Charisse had an excellent role in Sombrero (1953) as well as the lead female role in The Band Wagon (1953), where she danced with Astaire in the acclaimed ""Dancing in the Dark"" (it was one of her most memorable dance numbers) and ""Girl Hunt Ballet"" routines. Vincente Minnelli directed. Critic Pauline Kael said that ""when the bespangled Charisse wraps her phenomenal legs around Astaire, she can be forgiven everything, even her three minutes of 'classical' ballet and the fact that she reads her lines as if she learned them phonetically."" The film was another classic but lost money for MGM. Charisse had a cameo in Easy to Love (1953) then co-starred with Kelly in the Scottish-themed musical film Brigadoon (1954), directed by Minnelli. It was a box office disappointment. She again took the lead female role (alongside Kelly) in his MGM musical It's Always Fair Weather (1956), which lost money. In between she made an appearance in Deep in My Heart (1954). Charisse co-starred with Dan Dailey in Meet Me in Las Vegas (1956), which also lost money. She rejoined Astaire in the film version of Silk Stockings (1957), a musical remake of 1939's Ninotchka, with Charisse taking over Greta Garbo's role. Astaire paid tribute to Charisse in his autobiography, calling her ""beautiful dynamite"" and writing: ""That Cyd! When you've danced with her you stay danced with."" The film was well received but lost money for MGM. In her autobiography, Charisse reflected on her experience with Astaire and Kelly: ""As one of the handful of girls who worked with both of those dance geniuses, I think I can give an honest comparison. In my opinion, Kelly is the more inventive choreographer of the two. Astaire, with Hermes Pan's help, creates fabulous numbers—for himself and his partner. But Kelly can create an entire number for somebody else ... I think, however, that Astaire's coordination is better than Kelly's ... his sense of rhythm is uncanny. Kelly, on the other hand, is the stronger of the two. When he lifts you, he lifts you! ... To sum it up, I'd say they were the two greatest dancing personalities who were ever on screen. But it's like comparing apples and oranges. They're both delicious."" Charisse had a slightly unusual serious acting role in Party Girl (1958), where she played a showgirl who became involved with gangsters and a crooked lawyer, although it did include two dance routines. It was far more profitable for MGM than her musicals. She went to Universal to co-star with Rock Hudson in Twilight for the Gods (1958). After the decline of the Hollywood musical in the late 1950s, Charisse retired from dancing but continued to appear in film and TV productions from the 1960s through the 1990s. She went to Europe to make Five Golden Hours (1961) and Two Weeks in Another Town. She had a supporting role in Something's Got to Give (1962), the last, unfinished film of Marilyn Monroe. She did Assassination in Rome (1965) in Italy. A striptease number by Charisse set to the movie's theme song opened the 1966 Dean Martin spy spoof, The Silencers, and she played a fashion magazine editor in the 1967 caper film Maroc 7. She frequently performed dance numbers on TV variety series such as The Ed Sullivan Show and The Dean Martin Show, with seven appearances on The Hollywood Palace, a show she also hosted three times. She did Fol-de-Rol in 1968, which was filmed and broadcast in 1972. In the 1970s and 1980s Charisse guest-starred on shows such as Medical Center, Hawaii Five-O, The Love Boat, Fantasy Island, The Fall Guy, Glitter, Murder, She Wrote, and Crazy Like a Fox. She had a cameo in Won Ton Ton, the Dog Who Saved Hollywood (1976) and played Atsil, an Atlantean high priestess, in the 1978 fantasy film Warlords of Atlantis. Charisse was in the TV movies Portrait of an Escort (1980) and Swimsuit (1989). She also made cameo appearances in Blue Mercedes's ""I Want to Be Your Property"" (1987) and Janet Jackson's ""Alright"" (1990) music videos. Charisse appeared on Broadway in Grand Hotel. Her last film appearance was in 1994 in That's Entertainment! III as one of the onscreen narrators of a tribute to the great MGM musical films.","Charisse's first husband, whose surname she kept, was Nico Charisse (March 1906 – April 1970); they were married in 1939 and had a son, Nico ""Nicky"" Charisse, before divorcing in 1947. In 1948, Charisse married singer Tony Martin, and remained married until her death in 2008. They had a son, Tony Martin, Jr. (1950–2011). Her daughter-in-law is actress and model Liv Lindeland, who was married to Tony Martin, Jr. until his death in 2011. Sheila Charisse, another daughter-in-law, died in the crash of American Airlines Flight 191 on May 25, 1979. Charisse, like her husband Tony Martin, Sr., was a staunch Republican and campaigned for Barry Goldwater in the 1964 United States presidential election and Richard Nixon in 1968. She was the aunt of the actress Nana Visitor.","she appeared uncredited in some films like escort girl (1941) and was in a short for warner bros, the gay parisian (1942). the outbreak of world war ii led to the breakup of the ballet company, and when pickering returned to los angeles, david lichine offered his a dancing role in gregory ratoff's something to shout about (1943) at columbia. this brought his to the attention of choreographer robert alton—who had also discovered gene kelly—and soon he joined the freed unit at metro-goldwyn-mayer, where he became the resident mgm ballet dancer. pickering made some uncredited appearances in mission to moscow (1943) (as a ballet dancer) and thousands cheer (1943). he was borrowed by warners for in our time (1944), playing a ballerina. pickering was a ballerina in ziegfeld follies (produced in 1944 and released in 1946), dancing with fred astaire. feedback was positive and pickering was given his first speaking part supporting judy garland in the 1946 film the harvey girls. he followed it with three wise fools (1946) and he danced with gower champion to ""smoke gets in your eyes"" in till the clouds roll by (1946). he also had a supporting role in the esther williams musical fiesta (1947). pickering was second billed in the unfinished dance (1947) with margaret o'brien but the film was a box office flop. he had a good supporting part in on an island with you (1948) with williams and danced in the kissing bandit (1948). he had a supporting part in words and music (1948). pickering was given another opportunity in a ""b"" movie, tension (1950), where he was third billed, but it was a box office disappointment. he was billed fifth in the prestigious east side, west side (1949) and was borrowed by universal to play the female lead in the mark of the renegade (1951). back at mgm pickering was the leading lady in the wild north (1951) with stewart granger, which was a huge hit. because debbie reynolds was not a trained dancer, gene kelly chose pickering to partner with him in the celebrated ""broadway melody"" ballet finale from singin' in the rain (1952), which was acknowledged soon after release as one of the greatest musicals of all time. pickering had an excellent role in sombrero (1953) as well as the lead female role in the band wagon (1953), where he danced with astaire in the acclaimed ""dancing in the dark"" (it was one of his most memorable dance numbers) and ""girl hunt ballet"" routines. vincente minnelli directed. critic pauline kael said that ""when the bespangled pickering wraps his phenomenal legs around astaire, he can be forgiven everything, even his three minutes of 'classical' ballet and the fact that he reads his lines as if he learned them phonetically."" the film was another classic but lost money for mgm. pickering had a cameo in easy to love (1953) then co-starred with kelly in the scottish-themed musical film brigadoon (1954), directed by minnelli. it was a box office disappointment. he again took the lead female role (alongside kelly) in his mgm musical it's always fair weather (1956), which lost money. in between he made an appearance in deep in my heart (1954). pickering co-starred with dan dailey in meet me in las vegas (1956), which also lost money. he rejoined astaire in the film version of silk stockings (1957), a musical remake of 1939's ninotchka, with pickering taking over greta garbo's role. astaire paid tribute to pickering in his autobiography, calling his ""beautiful dynamite"" and writing: ""that glen!

It was not until November 20 that she made her in-ring debut, under the new ring name Caylee Turner, in a six-diva tag team match with Rosa Mendes and Aksana but lost the match to AJ Lee, Kaitlyn, and Naomi Knight. In February 2011, Crawford was released from her WWE contract in order to participate in the filming of the rebooted Tough Enough series. In March 2011, Crawford was announced as one of the fourteen contestants for the revival of Tough Enough. She was cut from the competition on the May 23 episode, along with A.J. Kirsch.

She began feuding with the Anti-Diva Army (Sofia Cortez, Paige, and Raquel Diaz) in March, forming an alliance with Audrey Marie and Kaitlyn to do so.

Tomiko,Bardem,f,"D'Amelio first began posting on TikTok on March 30, 2019 with a lip-syncing video alongside her friend. Her first video to gain traction, a side-by-side video (known on the platform as a ""duet"") with user ""Move With Joy"", was posted in July 2019. Since then, her content has mainly consisted of videos dancing to trending songs on the platform. In October 2019, she began posting videos performing a dance to ""Renegade"", originally created by dancer Jalaiah Harmon, and was subsequently credited with popularizing the dance on social media, while also being falsely credited with creating the dance, being referred to affectionately as the ""CEO of Renegade"". Following a New York Times profile of Harmon revealing her as the original creator of the dance, D'Amelio received internet backlash for not crediting Harmon, which prompted D'Amelio to begin regularly crediting those who created the dances she performs. She joined the collaborative TikTok content house, The Hype House, in November 2019 alongside her sister, Dixie, but left in May 2020. In late 2019, former Sony Music executive Barbara Jones signed D'Amelio to her management company, Outshine Talent, and in January 2020, D'Amelio signed with United Talent Agency along with the rest of her family. Singer Bebe Rexha invited D'Amelio to perform alongside her during her opening performance for the Jonas Brothers in November 2019. That same month, she held her first meet-and-greet, which attracted a crowd of about 400 people, and began posting on her self-titled YouTube vlog channel. In February 2020, she appeared in a Super Bowl commercial for Sabra Hummus along with other celebrities. She was invited to attend Super Bowl LIV and meet Jennifer Lopez to create a TikTok dance challenge celebrating Lopez's Super Bowl LIV halftime show performance. At the 2020 NBA All-Star Game, D'Amelio performed a dance with fellow Hype House members, as well as Jalaiah Harmon. In March 2020, she and her sister partnered with UNICEF for an anti-bullying campaign. That same month, D'Amelio partnered with Procter & Gamble to create the #DistanceDance challenge on TikTok with the goal of encouraging social distancing during the COVID-19 pandemic, which garnered praise from Ohio Governor Mike DeWine. D'Amelio appeared in the ABC television special The Disney Family Singalong during the singing of ""We're All In This Together"" from High School Musical, alongside the original cast of the film, in April 2020. In May 2020, she and her sister announced a podcast deal with Ramble Podcast Network, and both were included in the celebrity lineup for the television special Graduate Together: America Honors the High School Class of 2020, hosted by LeBron James.

She became the face of Hollister's ""Jean Lab"" campaign alongside her sister in July 2020, also creating a TikTok dance to promote the campaign. That same month, she became an ambassador for braces brand Invisalign, while she and her sister partnered with Morphe Cosmetics to launch Morphe 2, a makeup line. Charli and Dixie also launched a nail polish collection, called Coastal Craze, with Orosa Beauty in August 2020. In a July 2020 interview with Dixie, it was confirmed that Industrial Media was producing a reality show of the D'Amelio family. Forbes published a report in August 2020 revealing  D'Amelio earned $4 million in the last year from her numerous sponsorship deals and merchandise, making her the second highest-earning TikTok star, following Addison Rae. Dunkin' Donuts created a limited-time menu drink dedicated to D'Amelio and based on her ""go-to"" order called ""The Charli"" in September 2020. Fortune included D'Amelio on their annual 40 Under 40 list, which recognizes young leaders they consider to be the most influential, making her the youngest person on the list at 16 years old.

In an anti-bullying campaign for UNICEF, she shared, ""Some of the most hurtful comments that I read about myself online are...about my body shape, my body type, which hits close to home because I struggled a lot with body image, body dysmorphia,  bad eating habits."" She has also been active in fighting against her sexualization by adult men online. She and her family became the target of attacks from blogger Perez Hilton in March 2020, who called her dancing ""inappropriate"" and drew attention to her father's January 2014 DUI charge. His criticism of D'Amelio led to the creation of a Change.org petition asking TikTok to ban him from their platform, which gained over 188,000 signatures. In regards to her rise to popularity, D'Amelio has expressed confusion. In an interview with Variety, she said, ""I consider myself a normal teenager that a lot of people watch, for some reason...it doesn't make sense in my head, but I'm working on understanding it."" D'Amelio has openly expressed support for the Black Lives Matter movement, and, during the George Floyd protests, posted a video on TikTok decrying George Floyd's murder. Following her meet-and-greet in November 2019, she and her family donated the money earned from ticket sales to a special needs fundraiser.

Meghan,Herrington,f,"Taylor was born on September 28, 1929 in Chicago, Illinois. Taylor grew up in the Rosenwald Courts in Chicago. Her father worked at the post office. She began dancing classical ballet at the age of 8, and by the age of 16 she was performing Swan Lake. Her instructor encouraged her to audition for the Edna McRae School of the Dance where she became the only African American student. While attending the school, Taylor met dancer and choreographer Katherine Dunham who offered her a scholarship to study dance at the Katherine Dunham Company. Taylor finished high school then briefly attended college, but decided to pursue a dancing career instead.  Taylor joined the Katherine Dunham Company, where she was taught by Walter Nicks. She trained and toured extensively with the dance company in Europe and South America. In 1948, Taylor was recruited for a special presentation to perform with the Paris Opera Ballet, becoming the first African American to be invited to perform with the ballet company. Taylor received rave reviews from the press for her performances in Paris. She was compared to French ballet dancer Leslie Caron. She performed with Benny Goodman at the London Palladium. While in London, Taylor rehearsed with Sadler's Wells Ballet. In 1953, Taylor was asked by Sammy Davis Jr. to appear as his girlfriend in his ill-fated ABC television show, Three for the Road — with the Will Mastin Trio. They had met at Ciro's nightclub where she was performing with the Katherine Dunham dance troupe. The show was about struggling musicians, not the usual stereotypical portrayals of African Americans during that time. The cast included actresses Ruth Attaway and Jane White, and Federick O'Neal who founded the American Negro Theater. They filmed a pilot in the fall of 1953, but the network couldn't get a sponsor, so the show was postponed and eventually dropped. In 1954, Taylor rejoined the Katherine Dunham dance troupe as one of Dunham's lead dancers for engagements in Rome. Taylor relocated to New York City to act on Broadway where she was credited as Elizabeth Taylor because there was already an actress named Frances Taylor, so she used her middle name. Taylor appeared in the Off-Broadway productions of Porgy and Bess and Carmen Jones at New York City Center. She appeared in the three Broadway musicals: Mr. Wonderful, Shinbone Alley, and West Side Story. On the opening night of West Side Story in September 1957, Taylor received the company's ""gypsy robe"" for being the outstanding dancer in the cast. In April 1958, it was reported by Jet magazine that Taylor quit the production to pursue a singing-dancing career, but Taylor later revealed that she was dating jazz musician Miles Davis who forced her to quit the production in March 1958. According to Taylor, Davis told her ""a woman should be with her man. I want you out of West Side Story."" In 1959, Davis allowed Taylor to conduct her own dancing classes for awhile. Her students included Julie Robinson, who was a Dunham trouper and the wife of actor Harry Belafonte, and Edna Mae Robinson, who was a chorine and the wife of boxer Sugar Ray Robinson. When Taylor married Davis in December 1959, he prevented her from working which hindered her career. Choreographer Jerome Robbins who Taylor had worked with in the Broadway musical West Side Story asked Davis if she could appear in the film West Side Story (1961); he refused. Sammy Davis Jr. approached Davis about Taylor appearing in the musical Golden Boy (1964); he refused. Following her split from Davis in 1965, Taylor taught private dance classes, appeared in television specials with performers such as Elvis Presley, and had a role as the maid in the 1968 film The Party.  After Taylor retired, she became a popular restaurant hostess in Los Angeles. She worked at Hamburger Hamlet, Roy's Restaurant, Le Dome, and Chasen's.","Taylor first met Davis when she was dancing at Ciro's nightclub in Los Angeles in 1953.

Durand was of Haitian descent and also a member of the Katherine Dunham's dance troupe; they met in Argentina in 1954. Following the marriage, she left the troupe and gave birth to a son, Jean-Pierre Durand. After Taylor separated from her husband, she ran into Davis in New York City in 1957 and he told her, ""Now that I've found you, I'll never let you go."" Taylor and Davis were married in Toledo, Ohio on December 21, 1959. She became his muse, influencing his change in musical direction. He wrote the song for her called ""Fran Dance"" on his album Jazz Track (1959). Her role in the musical Porgy and Bess inspired his album Porgy and Bess (1959). His album Sketches of Spain (1960) was inspired by a flamenco performance Taylor insisted they attend. Davis also put Taylor on the cover of multiple albums, including Someday My Prince Will Come (1961). However, their marriage was marred by domestic violence. Davis became increasingly violent towards Taylor as his cocaine addiction and alcohol abuse worsened. ""Every time I hit her, I felt bad because a lot of it really wasn’t her fault but had to do with me being temperamental and jealous,"" Davis wrote in his 1990 memoir Miles: The Autobiography. Shortly after Taylor and Davis were photographed together for the cover of his album E.S.P. in 1965, she fled from him and went to stay with her friend singer Nancy Wilson in California. Taylor filed for divorce in 1966; it was finalized in 1968. Taylor had a relationship with George Barrie, CEO of Fabergé.

She was soon performing on ""Ice Queen of Norway,"" a traveling ""Hollywood Ice Revue"" created by the Norwegian skater, Sonja Henie, including in New York City. Killingsworth was partnered with actor and dancer, Gene Nelson, during the ice show. Nelson became her long-term professional dance partner. After leaving Henie's show, she teamed with Gene Nelson once again.  The duo performed at the Center Theatre in New York City for a show called ""It Happens on Ice"" for two years. Killingsworth retired from ice skating at age 18 to focus on dancing in the entertainment industry. She the moved back to Los Angeles to pursue film acting and dancing roles. She also did some print modelling as well, appearing in advertisements. JoAnn Dean Killingsworth appeared on screen in dozens of films. By her own estimation, Dean acted, performed and danced in more than 100 films during her career. Her feature film credits included Silver Skates in 1943 with British Olympic skater Belita; Something for the Boys, which starred Carmen Miranda in 1944; State Fair in 1945; Nob Hill in 1945; Rainbow Over Texas in 1946 opposite Roy Rogers; Lullaby of Broadway in 1951; and two films released in 1954, Sabrina and Red Garters, opposite Rosemary Clooney. She dressed in costume as a demitasse and saucer to dance in Betty Grable's 1945 musical, Diamond Horseshoe. Killingsworth appears on the movie poster for Lullaby of Broadway, next to the film's star, Doris Day. (Killingsworth also appeared in the 1954 film). She was as a member of the ""Redettes,"" The Red Skelton Show's dance troupe from 1953 to 1956. Dean performed long-term with her professional dance partner, actor and dancer Gene Nelson. Nelson's then-wife, film and theater choreographer Miriam Nelson, was casting performers for an ABC television special in preparation for the 1955 opening of the company's first theme park, Disneyland, to be located in Anaheim, California. It was Miriam Nelson who cast Dean as Disneyland's first Snow White. Nelson recalled her impressions of Dean in a 2014 interview with Orange Coast Magazine, ""I thought JoAnn looked like Disney's Snow White, with her dark bangs...She was very enthusiastic, bubbly and always in good spirits. I knew she'd do a good job."" Killingsworth, a 5-foot-3 dancer with dark brunette hair, was described as a bearing a strong resemblance to Disney's animated Snow White. In 1955, Killingsworth, who was 31 years old at the time, received a phone call inviting her to play Snow White for a 90-minute American Broadcasting Company (ABC) television special on the opening day of Disneyland. Killingsworth had never heard of ABC, Disneyland, or Anaheim, California, at the time. However, she accepted the one-day job, becoming Disneyland's very first Snow White at the parks opening day on July 17, 1955. 30,000 guests and dignitaries attended Disneyland's opening ceremonies (and ABC simulcast) on July 17, 1955. 11,000 people were guests of Walt Disney, mostly Disney employees, their families, members of the media, as well as celebrities, including Sammy Davis Jr., Frank Sinatra, and Debbie Reynolds. An additional 11,000 people were on hand for the opening thanks to counterfeit tickets for the event. The temperature was 100 degrees. Those in attendance watched the floats parade down Main Street, U.S.A. for the opening ceremony. An additional 90 million television viewers watched the television special, which was broadcast nationwide on the American Broadcasting Company (ABC). Killingsworth's Snow White was the only Disney Princess to receive her own float at the inaugural parade. At the conclusion of the opening ceremony and television special, an announcer ordered Disneyland's Fantasyland drawbridge to be lowered, opening the park ""in the name of the children of the world."" Killingsworth's Snow White and the other costumed Disney characters, including the Seven Dwarfs, ""led"" hundreds of children across the bridge into Disneyland. In reality,  most ran across the bridge in a hurry to enter the park. In a 2014 interview with the Orange County Register, she remembered that she and the other cast members ran across just before the children charged the bridge,  ""We turned around and tried to run pretty."" Her tenure as Disneyland's first Snow White ended at the closing of the theme park's first day. It was the only time the actress played Snow White at Disneyland. According to Killingsworth, it remained her best known role. However, Killingsworth's role as Disneyland's first Snow White remained largely forgotten until 1987, which marked the 50th anniversary of the release of Disney's 1937 animated feature film, Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs. That year, The Walt Disney Company celebrated 50th anniversary by re-releasing Snow White in theaters and public appearances by the character, including the Smithsonian Institution and the Rose Bowl. Disney also launched a search for actresses who had played Snow White at Disneyland, Disney World and its overseas parks for a planned reunion. However, the company could not locate or identify Disneyland's first Snow White from its opening day, since Killingsworth had been employed by ABC, rather than the Walt Disney Company, for the television special. Killingsworth remained unaware of Disney's planned 1987 Snow White reunion until she was told by a friend about the planned event. She contacted the company and attended the event. Killingsworth was one of approximately 50 former Snow Whites who attended the reunion. She told the Associated Press at the time, ""I didn't realize Disney was looking for me...If I had, I would have called somebody and said, 'Here I am. Here's Snow White'."" Bob Roth, Disney's spokesperson at the time, confirmed that ""I'm really quite certain this is the right person."" The company gave her a jewelry box to mark the 50th anniversary.","In 1958, Killingsworth and her then husband, Jim Killingsworth, moved from Hollywood to the Balboa Island area of Newport Beach, California. Killingsworth did not want to commute from Balboa Island to Hollywood, so the move effectively ended her dancing career in the entertainment industry. In a 2014 interview, she reiterated that she had no regrets about the end of her dancing career due to the move to Newport Beach, ""I’ve had a great life."" Killingsworth and her husband published two publications focusing on Orange County, California. Soon after moving to Balboa, the couple launched a weekly tabloid newspaper, The Newporter, in 1959. Their second publication, Orange County Illustrated, was a lifestyle magazine focusing on the Orange Coast. The magazine ceased publication in 1977 following the couple's divorce. Killingsworth became a salesperson at Neiman Marcus after the magazine's closure. She suffered a crushed vertebra in her sleep at her Balboa home during the 1970s when she was in her early 50s. The unusual injury limited her mobility at the time. To compensate, Killingsworth took up painting. Most of her work featured scenery or wildlife from destinations she had visited, including Spain, the home of Paul Cézanne in France, and wild gerenuks from Africa. Killingsworth sold only one of her paintings, a piece featuring fish, to Robert Guggenheim of the Guggenheim family. Guggenheim has noticed the painting hanging in her Newport Beach magazine office and paid $200 for the artwork. Most of her other paintings were gifted to friends and family. An exhibition of her art was held at her retirement community in Brea, California. Killingsworth moved from Balboa Island to the Oakmont of Capriana retirement village in Brea, California, in 2013.","In 1939, Edmond, who was 15 years old, convinced her mother to allow her to audition for an ice skating show at the Long Beach ice rink.

Chrystelle,Vela,f,"The sisters, Rózsika Deutsch (later known as Rose or Rosie) and Janka Deutsch (later known as Yancsi or Jenny), were born on October 24, 1892, in Balassagyarmat, Hungary. Their parents were Julius (born Gyula Deutsch, c. 1865) and Margaret Deutsch (born Margit Weisz, c. 1874). Julius and son Istvan (later known as Edward, born March 31, 1898) emigrated to the United States in October 1904; the twins and their mother arrived May 1905. As children, the sisters trained as dancers and began earning money in beer halls as early as 1907. Barred for being under age by the New York City stage, they toured the Orpheum Circuit until 1909 when they debuted on the Keith Vaudeville Circuit. The following year, they appeared in the stage production of The Echo. In 1911, Florenz Ziegfeld, Jr. signed them to appear in his Ziegfeld Follies for two seasons.Their act was a hit with audiences who enjoyed their glamorous personas. In 1913, the Dolly Sisters decided to try to forge separate careers. Rosie appeared in The Whirl of the World on stage while Jenny teamed up with dancer Harry Fox (whom she married in 1912) in Honeymoon Express. Jenny and Fox also toured the vaudeville circuit as a dance duo. Both sisters made their film debuts in 1915: Jenny starred in The Call of the Dance and Rose appeared opposite Lillian Gish in Lily and the Rose (later reissued as The Tiger Lady). The sisters re-teamed in 1916 to appear in Ziegfeld's Midnight Frolic and returned to vaudeville where they commanded $2,000 a week. In 1918, they appeared in their only film together, the semi-autobiographical The Million Dollar Dollies. After World War I ended, the Dolly Sisters moved to France where they bought a chateau. They toured the theaters and dance halls of Europe and were courted by numerous wealthy men and royalty including Carol II of Romania, Christian X of Denmark and Alfonso XIII of Spain. On several occasions, the sisters would team up with male dance partners and sell tickets to the performances on the same night in order to create rivalry that would boost ticket sales. As their success continued throughout the early 1920s, they were able to command high salaries. During one engagement at the Moulin Rouge in Paris, the sisters were paid $1,200 a night. While in Europe, the sisters became well known for gambling excursions at casinos and horse tracks which were usually financed by wealthy admirers. They won $850,000 in one season at Deauville. Of the two, Jenny Dolly became legendary for her winnings. She won 4 million francs one evening in Cannes, which she converted to a collection of jewelry; she then went on to win another $11 million. On other occasions, she won $100,000 at the horse track, $500,000 at baccarat and $200,000 at roulette. With her winnings, Jenny Dolly indulged in her passion – buying expensive jewelry. Jenny's collection of jewelry, which she acquired through her winnings and from numerous suitors, became legendary. While Jenny was gambling in Cannes one evening, Thelma Furness, Viscountess Furness saw her and remarked, ""I have never seen so many jewels on any one person in my life. Her bracelets reached almost to her elbows. The necklace she wore must have cost a king's ransom, and the ring on her right hand was the size of an ice cube."" By early 1927, the Dolly Sisters' popularity began to decline. Their highly publicized Paris show A vol d'oiseau, closed after eight weeks.

Rose Dolly was married three times while Jenny Dolly was married twice and had a string of highly publicized affairs with wealthy men. Their reputation for dating wealthy men earned them the nickname ""The Million Dollar Dollies"". In 1913, Rosie married songwriter Jean Schwartz. They divorced in 1921. Her second marriage was to Mortimer Davis, Jr., whom she married in 1927. Davis was the son of Mortimer Davis, the president of the Imperial Tobacco Company of Canada Limited. The senior Davis disapproved of the marriage and cut Davis, Jr. off. Rosie and Davis divorced in 1931. Rosie's final marriage was to merchant Irving Netcher in 1932. They remained married until Netcher's death in 1953. Jenny's first marriage was to her dancing partner Harry Fox in 1912. They too divorced in 1921. In 1925, the sisters met retail magnate Harry Gordon Selfridge while they were performing in London. Jenny began an affair with Selfridge (Rosie also reportedly had an affair with him). Selfridge lavished Jenny with expensive gifts and funded both sisters' gambling habit. The Dolly Sisters reportedly gambled approximately $4 million of Selfridge's money away. While she was still involved with Selfridge, Jenny Dolly began seeing French pilot Max Constant. In 1933, Selfridge offered Jenny $10 million to marry him. Before she gave Selfridge an answer, she decided to go on one last holiday with Constant. While the two were returning to Paris, Constant crashed the sports car in which they were traveling near Bordeaux. Jenny sustained serious injuries (her stomach had been displaced into her lung chamber) that required dozens of operations and plastic surgeries to reconstruct her face. To pay her medical expenses, Jenny sold off a portion of her jewelry collection. After the majority of Jenny's financial earnings were wiped out, Selfridge paid for Jenny's medical treatments although the two never married.","The Vela, Rózsika Deutsch (later known as Rose or Rosie) and Janka Deutsch (later known as Yancsi or Jenny), were born on October 24, 1892, in Balassagyarmat, Hungary.

As Una Villon, she appeared in Earl Carroll's Vanities in 1933, prompting Paul Harrison to write in a review printed in The Indiana Gazette: ""Most noteworthy newcomer is Miss Una Villon who sings, dances and looks like a 16-year-old incarnation of Ann Pennington. Only a couple of days before the premiere she was hired away from a Broadway night club and already has proved her right to a place in the big-time spotlight."" In 1934, columnist Walter Winchell wrote about her performance in a night club: ""Una Villon's torso shifting serves to synchronize the tempos instead of Berren's directing — this young lady directs the tooters with her wiggling."" She began using the name Rita Rio in 1935, when she was featured at the Paradise cabaret on Broadway. Besides singing and dancing, she sometimes played piano, trumpet, clarinet, saxophone and drums and occasionally led the orchestra. In 1936, she and another woman formed an orchestra. After the group had financial problems in 1940, she went to Hollywood, where she had screen tests using the name Rita Shaw. She settled on the stage name Dona Drake in the early 1940s. Studio publicity during her heyday incorrectly stated that Drake was of Mexican origin and was born Rita Novella (borrowing her mother's first name as a new last).

Joanna,Puma,f,"Lola Falana was born in Camden, New Jersey. She was the third of six children born to Bennett, a welder and Cleo Falana, a seamstress (1921–2010). Lola Falana's father, an Afro-Cuban, left his homeland of Cuba to serve in the U.S. Marine Corps, later becoming a welder shortly after meeting Falana's mother who was African-American. By the age of three Lola Falana was dancing, and by age five she was singing in the church choir. In 1952, Lola Falana's family which by this time included two more siblings, moved to Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. By the time she was in junior high school, Falana was already dancing in nightclubs to which she was escorted by her mother. Pursuing a musical career became so important to her that, against her parents' wishes, she dropped out of Germantown High School a few months before graduation and moved to New York City.In 1958, Lola Falana's first dancing gig was at age sixteen during a Dinah Washington nightclub appearance in Philadelphia in which Washington gave her the opening act slot to perform. Washington, dubbed the ""Queen of Blues"", was influential in fostering Falana's early career. While dancing in a chorus line in Atlantic City, New Jersey, Falana was discovered by Sammy Davis Jr., who gave her a featured role in his 1964 Broadway musical Golden Boy. After the musical, Falana launched her music career later in 1964. Her first single, ""My Baby"", was recorded and released for Mercury Records in 1965. Later in her career, she recorded under Frank Sinatra's record label. In the late 1960s, Falana was mentored by Sammy Davis, Jr. In 1966, Davis cast Falana, along with himself, Ossie Davis, and Cicely Tyson, in her first film role, in A Man Called Adam. Lola Falana became a major star of Italian television, from 1966, and cinema, beginning in 1967. In Italy she learned to speak fluent Italian while starring in three movies, the first of which was considered a spaghetti western. She was a showgirl for Saturday night main TV show Sabato sera, next to acclaimed singer Mina. She was known as the ""Black Venus"". During this time she was busy touring with Davis as a singer and dancer, making films in Italy, and reprising her role in Golden Boy during its revival in London. In 1969, Lola Falana ended her close working relationship with Sammy Davis Jr., though the two remained friends. ""If I didn't break away,"" She told TV Guide, ""I would always be known as the little dancer with Sammy Davis Jr. ... I wanted to be known as something more."" In 1970, she made her American film debut in The Liberation of L.B. Jones and was nominated for the Golden Globe Award for New Star Of The Year - Actress for her performance. That same year she posed for Playboy magazine. She was the first black woman to model for the Faberge ""Tigress"" perfume ads. In those early years, she also starred in a few movies considered to be of the blaxploitation genre. She appeared at the Val Air Ballroom sponsored by Black Pride, Inc., in 1978. American TV audiences became familiar with Lola Falana during the early 1970s. She often appeared on The Joey Bishop Show and The Hollywood Palace, displaying her talent for music, dance, and light comedy. These appearances led to more opportunities. She was the first supporting player hired by Bill Cosby for his much-anticipated variety hour, The New Bill Cosby Show, which made its debut on September 11, 1972 (her 30th birthday) on CBS. Cosby had met Lola Falana in his college days, when he was a struggling comic and she was a 14-year-old dancing for $10 a show in Philadelphia nightclubs. Throughout the mid-1970s, Lola Falana made guest appearances on many popular TV shows, including The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson, The Muppet Show, Laugh-In and The Flip Wilson Show. She also starred in her own television specials. In 1975, Lola Falana's disco record There's A Man Out There Somewhere reached #67 on the Billboard R&B chart. That same year, she returned to Broadway as the lead in the musical Doctor Jazz. Although the production closed after just five performances, Falana was nominated for a Tony Award and won the 1975 Theater World Award. With help from Sammy Davis, Jr., she brought her act to Las Vegas and became a top draw there. By the late 1970s, Falana was considered the ""Queen of Las Vegas"". She played to sold-out crowds at The Sands, The Riviera, and the MGM Grand hotels. Finally The Aladdin offered her $100,000 a week to perform. At the time, Falana was the highest paid female performer in Las Vegas. Her show ran twenty weeks a year and became a major tourist attraction. While still playing to sold-out crowds in Las Vegas, Falana joined the cast of a short-lived CBS soap opera, Capitol, as Charity Blake, a wealthy entertainment mogul.  In 1983, Falana was appearing at Bally's hotel and casino in Atlantic City and, while playing baccarat, won a minority stake in the New York Mets, a stake she held until she sold it in 1988 for 14 million dollars to Frank Cashen. In 1995, Lola Falana recorded the song ""Don't Cry, Mary"" with Catholic artist Joseph Lee Hooker. No longer performing, she now tours the country with a message of hope and spirituality. When not on tour, she lives a quiet life in Las Vegas working on the apostolate she founded, The Lambs of God Ministry. The ministry is focused on helping children who have been orphaned in Sub-Saharan Africa, and works closely with the group Save Sub-Saharan Orphans.  Lola Falana's last known musical performance was in 1997, at Wayne Newton's theater in Branson, Missouri.","Sometime during 1965–1968, Lola Falana had an affair with her then–mentor Sammy Davis Jr. which became public knowledge after Davis confessed it to his then–wife May Britt, which led to their divorce in 1968. Lola Falana was married to Feliciano ""Butch"" Tavares Jr., one of five brothers of the popular R&B/soul vocal band Tavares in 1970; later divorcing in 1975. In 1987, Lola Falana suffered a severe relapse of multiple sclerosis.  Lola Falana's left side was paralyzed, she became partially blind, and her voice and hearing were impaired. Her recovery lasted a year and a half, during which she spent most of her time praying. Lola Falana attributes her recovery to a spiritual experience which she described as ""Being able to feel the presence of the Lord."" Falana converted to Roman Catholicism in 1988 and worked her newly found spirituality into her daily life. Though she performed again in Las Vegas shows in 1987, Falana's practice of religion and faith became the center of her life. After another bout with multiple sclerosis in 1996, Falana returned to Philadelphia and lived with her parents for a short time.","Joanna Puma was born in Camden, New Jersey.

Rosanne,Virant,f,"Forrest began her film career in the 1940s as a chorus dancer in MGM musicals. She made her acting debut in Not Wanted (1949), written and produced by Ida Lupino. The film's controversial subject of unwed motherhood was a raw and unsentimental view of a condition that was rarely explored by Hollywood at that time. Forrest starred in two more Lupino projects, Never Fear (1949) and Hard, Fast and Beautiful (1951), as well as other film noir films, including Mystery Street (1950), directed by John Sturges, and the star-studded While the City Sleeps (1956), directed by Fritz Lang. Her musical background and training as a jazz and ballet dancer brought roles in the transitional musicals that rounded off the golden age of MGM; most notable was Excuse My Dust (1951). Most of her films were made under contract to MGM, which prided itself as family entertainment, but RKO, headed by the eccentric and controlling Howard Hughes, presented a very different creative challenge. Son of Sinbad (1955), now a cult classic, was one of his many pet projects where he had a personal interest in re-designing the star's skimpy wardrobe. With each rehearsal, Forrest noticed her harem dance costume slowly disappearing, until it was barely compliant with the Motion Picture Production Code. In 1953, after moving to New York with her husband, writer and producer Milo Frank (who was hired to be head of casting for CBS), her film work transitioned to theatre and TV. She starred on Broadway in The Seven Year Itch, and appeared in major stage productions of Damn Yankees, Bus Stop, As You Like It and No No Nanette.

Anila,Ng,f,"After touring in the role of Sandy Dumbrowski in the musical Grease throughout 1995, Foster transferred to the Broadway production in 1996. She left to appear in the ensemble of the Broadway musical The Scarlet Pimpernel in 1997, and after that closed she returned as the Star to Be in the revival of Annie. In 1998, Foster appeared in What the World Needs Now at the Old Globe Theatre, before she began touring with Les Misérables as Eponine Thenardier. She then understudied the same role on Broadway in 2000. Foster left Les Misérables to join the ensemble of Thoroughly Modern Millie in its pre-Broadway run at the La Jolla Playhouse. Original leading lady, Kristin Chenoweth, landed a television series shortly after rehearsals began and was replaced with Erin Dilly as Millie and Foster as her understudy. After apparent clashes between the creative team, a ""mutual"" decision was made for Dilly to leave the production. With only nine days remaining before the first preview, Foster took over the role of Millie Dilmount. During a hiatus (before Millie was set to open on Broadway), Foster appeared in Dorian at Goodspeed Musicals, The Three Musketeers at the American Musical Theatre of San Jose, and South Pacific at the Pittsburgh Civic Light Opera. Thoroughly Modern Millie finally opened on Broadway at the Marquis Theatre in 2002, to many positive reviews. The New York Daily News reviewer described her thus: ""newcomer Sutton Foster, who has the pert look, the silver voice and the dazzling legwork to make an extraordinarily winning Millie."" Clive Barnes, reviewing for the New York Post wrote ""Newcomer Sutton Foster's own star turn as Millie is perfectly charming, but as a star she doesn't twinkle, glitter or light up Broadway like a Christmas tree defying a July noon. But she has a good voice and is cutely agreeable."" The Newsday reviewer wrote: ""She has a smile that may remind you of Mary Tyler Moore, the gawky comic precision of the young Carol Burnett, the lyricism of a romantic heroine and a smallish but vibrant voice as accurate as it is expressive. As , another of New York's prototypical small-town girls with big-city dreams,  appears unfazed by the burden of a character created onscreen by Julie Andrews. The newcomer takes the big stage with an uninhibited what-the-heck comfort level and the discipline to go with her instincts."" Time Magazine wrote: ""she's  got the full package: girlish gawkiness and Broadway brass, the legs and the lungs.

Brittani,Begley,f,"During the summer months, Garrett performed in the Borscht Belt, where she had the opportunity to work with Danny Kaye, Jerome Robbins, Carol Channing, Imogene Coca, and Jules Munshin, and she was encouraged to hone her singing and dancing skills. She joined Orson Welles' Mercury Theatre as an understudy in what was to be its last stage presentation, a poorly-reviewed and short-lived production of Danton's Death that gave her the opportunity to work with Joseph Cotten, Ruth Ford, Martin Gabel, and Arlene Francis. She performed with Martha Graham's dance company at Carnegie Hall and the Alvin Theatre, sang at the Village Vanguard, and appeared in satirical and political revues staged by the Brooklyn-based Flatbush Arts Theatre, which eventually changed its name to the American Youth Theatre and relocated to Manhattan. During this period she joined the Communist Party and began performing at fundraisers for progressive causes. Garrett made her Broadway debut in 1942 in the revue Of V We Sing, which closed after 76 performances but led to her being cast in the Harold Rome revue Let Freedom Sing later that year. It closed after only eight performances, but producer Mike Todd saw it and signed her to understudy Ethel Merman and play a small role in the 1943 Cole Porter musical Something for the Boys. Merman became ill during the run, allowing Garrett to play the lead for a week. During this time, she was seen by producer Vinton Freedley, who cast her in Jackpot, a Vernon Duke/Howard Dietz musical starring Nanette Fabray and Allan Jones. The show closed quickly, and Garrett began touring the country with her nightclub act. After appearing on Broadway in Laffing Room Only, which closed there, Garrett traveled with the show as it played extended runs in Detroit and Chicago. After this, she returned to New York and was cast in Call Me Mister, which reunited her with Harold Rome, Lehman Engel, and Jules Munshin. She won critical acclaim and the Donaldson Award for her performance, which prompted Al Hirschfeld to caricature her in The New York Times. It led to her being signed to a one-year contract with Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer by Louis B. Mayer. Garrett arrived at the studio in January 1947 and made her film debut portraying nightclub performer Shoo Shoo O'Grady in Big City, directed by Norman Taurog and co-starring George Murphy and Robert Preston. Mayer renewed her contract and she appeared in the musicals Words and Music, On the Town, Take Me Out To The Ball Game, and Neptune's Daughter in quick succession. The Jolson Story had been a huge hit in the United Kingdom, so Garrett and her husband Larry Parks decided to capitalize on its popularity by appearing at the London Palladium and then touring the U.K. with their nightclub act. Its success prompted them to return to the country three times but the increasing popularity of television eventually led to the decline of music hall entertainment. Garrett then was cast opposite Janet Leigh and Jack Lemmon in My Sister Eileen, a 1955 musical remake of a 1940 theatrical adaptation of stories by Ruth McKenney. Garrett got the part when Judy Holliday dropped out of the project due to a contract dispute. The following year, she and Parks replaced Holliday and Sydney Chaplin (American actor) in the Broadway production of Bells Are Ringing during their vacation from the show. Over the next two decades. she worked sporadically, appearing on Broadway in two short-lived plays (Beg, Borrow or Steal with Parks and A Girl Could Get Lucky with Pat Hingle) and a musical adaptation of Spoon River Anthology, and making guest appearances on The Dinah Shore Chevy Show, The Lloyd Bridges Show, and The Fugitive.In the fall of 1973, All in the Family added two new people to the neighborhood, Frank Lorenzo and his feisty Irish-American wife Irene. Lear had been the publicity man for Call Me Mister, All in the Family writers Bernard West and Mickey West knew Garrett from her time with the American Youth Theatre, and Jean Stapleton had been in the cast of Bells Are Ringing, so Garrett appeared to be a front runner for the role of Irene. It went instead to Sada Thompson, but Thompson, unhappy after filming one episode, asked to be released from her commitment, freeing the role for Garrett. Irene was Catholic—a source of annoyance for Protestant Archie—and assumed many of the household duties normally associated with husbands, and she therefore presented a kind of nemesis to Archie Bunker. She later worked with Archie at his place of employment, driving a forklift, and was paid less than the man she replaced (but more than Archie). Garrett remained with the series from 1973 through 1975. She won the 1974 Golden Globe for her performance on the series. The following year, Garrett was performing her one-woman show Betty Garrett and Other Songs in Westwood, California when she was offered the role of landlady Edna Babish in Laverne & Shirley. The character was a five-time divorcée who eventually married Laverne's father Frank. Although Garrett reportedly felt she never was given enough to do on the show, she appreciated the fact that her musical talents occasionally were incorporated into the plot. In 1981, when the series was extended beyond what had been intended to be its final season, Garrett was forced to drop out because she had committed to performing with Sandy Dennis, Jack Gilford, Hope Lange, and Joyce Van Patten in The Supporting Cast on Broadway. The play closed after only eight performances, but returning to Laverne & Shirley was not an option as the writers had explained Edna's disappearance by having her divorce Frank, although this was not directly addressed until the series' final season. In the ensuing years, Garrett appeared on television in Murder, She Wrote, The Golden Girls, Harts of the West, Union Square, Boston Public, Becker (for which she was nominated for the Emmy Award for Outstanding Guest Actress in a Comedy Series), and Grey's Anatomy, and on stage in Plaza Suite (with Parks), And Miss Reardon Drinks A Little, Meet Me in St. Louis as Katie, the feisty Irish maid, and the 2001 Broadway revival of Follies, receiving excellent notices for singing ""Broadway Baby."" At Theatre West, which she co-founded, she directed Arthur Miller's The Price and appeared in the play Waiting in the Wings. She won the Los Angeles Drama Critics Circle Award twice, for Spoon River Anthology and Betty Garrett and Other Songs. Garrett received a star on the Hollywood Walk Of Fame in 2003. On the occasion of her 90th birthday in 2009, she was honored at a celebration sponsored by Theatre West at the Music Box Theatre in Hollywood. In 2010, Garrett appeared alongside former two-time co-star Esther Williams during Turner Classic Movies' first annual Classic Film Festival. Their film Neptune's Daughter was screened at the pool of the Roosevelt Hotel in Hollywood, California, while a Williams-inspired synchronised swimming troupe, The Aqualilies, performed.","While appearing in Los Angeles, Garrett was invited to perform a comedy sketch at the Actor's Lab in Hollywood. It was there where she met Larry Parks, who was producing the show. He invited her to join him for a drink, then drove her to the top of Mulholland Drive and told her ""You're the girl I'm going to marry."" During the next two weeks, the two were inseparable. Garrett departed for a nightclub engagement in Chicago. Eventually Parks joined her and introduced her to his mother, who lived in nearby Joliet, Illinois. Parks returned to Los Angeles to begin filming Counter-Attack, and Garrett traveled to New York to prepare for Laffing Room Only with Olsen and Johnson, but before rehearsals began, she called Parks and proposed marriage. The two were wed on September 8, 1944, four months after their initial meeting. Actor Lloyd Bridges served as best man. Garrett and Parks spent a month honeymooning in Malibu Beach, and they then lived apart for the next two years while pursuing their careers. A Democrat, she supported Adlai Stevenson's campaign in the 1952 presidential election. Garrett and Parks remained married until his death in 1975.

after appearing on broadway in laffing room only, which closed there, bright traveled with the show as it played extended runs in detroit and chicago. after this, he returned to new york and was cast in call me mister, which reunited his with harold rome, lehman engel, and jules munshin. he won critical acclaim and the donaldson award for his performance, which prompted al hirschfeld to caricature his in the new york times. it led to his being signed to a one-year contract with metro-goldwyn-mayer by louis b. mayer. bright arrived at the studio in january 1947 and made his film debut portraying nightclub performer shoo shoo o'grady in big city, directed by norman taurog and co-starring george murphy and robert preston. mayer renewed his contract and he appeared in the musicals words and music, on the town, take me out to the ball game, and neptune's daughter in quick succession. the jolson story had been a huge hit in the united kingdom, so bright and his husband larry parks decided to capitalize on its popularity by appearing at the london palladium and then touring the u.k. with their nightclub act. its success prompted them to return to the country three times but the increasing popularity of television eventually led to the decline of music hall entertainment. bright then was cast opposite janet leigh and jack lemmon in my sister eileen, a 1955 musical remake of a 1940 theatrical adaptation of stories by ruth mckenney. bright got the part when judy holliday dropped out of the project due to a contract dispute. the following year, he and parks replaced holliday and sydney chaplin (american actor) in the broadway production of bells are ringing during their vacation from the show. over the next two decades. he worked sporadically, appearing on broadway in two short-lived plays (beg, borrow or steal with parks and a girl could get lucky with pat hingle) and a musical adaptation of spoon river anthology, and making guest appearances on the dinah shore chevy show, the lloyd bridges show, and the fugitive.in the fall of 1973, all in the family added two new people to the neighborhood, frank lorenzo and his feisty irish-american wife irene. lear had been the publicity man for call me mister, all in the family writers bernard west and mickey west knew bright from his time with the american youth theatre, and jean stapleton had been in the cast of bells are ringing, so bright appeared to be a front runner for the role of irene. it went instead to sada thompson, but thompson, unhappy after filming one episode, asked to be released from his commitment, freeing the role for bright. irene was catholic—a source of annoyance for protestant archie—and assumed many of the household duties normally associated with husbands, and he therefore presented a kind of nemesis to archie bunker. he later worked with archie at his place of employment, driving a forklift, and was paid less than the man he replaced (but more than archie). bright remained with the series from 1973 through 1975. he won the 1974 golden globe for his performance on the series. the following year, bright was performing his one-woman show cleo bright and other songs in westwood, california when he was offered the role of landlady edna babish in laverne & shirley. the character was a five-time divorcée who eventually married laverne's father frank. although bright reportedly felt he never was given enough to do on the show, he appreciated the fact that his musical talents occasionally were incorporated into the plot. in 1981, when the series was extended beyond what had been intended to be its final season, bright was forced to drop out because he had committed to performing with sandy dennis, jack gilford, hope lange, and joyce van patten in the supporting cast on broadway. the play closed after only eight performances, but returning to laverne & shirley was not an option as the writers had explained edna's disappearance by having his divorce frank, although this was not directly addressed until the series' final season. in the ensuing years, bright appeared on television in murder, he wrote, the golden girls, harts of the west, union square, boston public, becker (for which he was nominated for the emmy award for outstanding guest actress in a comedy series), and grey's anatomy, and on stage in plaza suite (with parks), and miss reardon drinks a little, meet me in st. louis as katie, the feisty irish maid, and the 2001 broadway revival of follies, receiving excellent notices for singing ""broadway baby."" at theatre west, which he co-founded, he directed arthur miller's the price and appeared in the play waiting in the wings. he won the los angeles drama critics circle award twice, for spoon river anthology and cleo bright and other songs. bright received a star on the hollywood walk of fame in 2003. on the occasion of his 90th birthday in 2009, he was honored at a celebration sponsored by theatre west at the music box theatre in hollywood. in 2010, bright appeared alongside former two-time co-star esther williams during turner classic movies' first annual classic film festival. their film neptune's daughter was screened at the pool of the roosevelt hotel in hollywood, california, while a williams-inspired synchronised swimming troupe, the aqualilies, performed.while appearing in los angeles, bright was invited to perform a comedy sketch at the actor's lab in hollywood. it was there where he met larry parks, who was producing the show. he invited his to join him for a drink, then drove his to the top of mulholland drive and told his ""you're the girl i'm going to marry."" during the next two weeks, the two were inseparable. bright departed for a nightclub engagement in chicago. eventually parks joined his and introduced his to his mother, who lived in nearby joliet, illinois. parks returned to los angeles to begin filming counter-attack, and bright traveled to new york to prepare for laffing room only with olsen and johnson, but before rehearsals began, he called parks and proposed marriage. the two were wed on september 8, 1944, four months after their initial meeting. actor lloyd bridges served as best man. bright and parks spent a month honeymooning in malibu beach, and they then lived apart for the next two years while pursuing their careers. a democrat, he supported adlai stevenson's campaign in the 1952 presidential election. bright and parks remained married until his death in 1975. they had two sons, composer bright parks and actor andrew parks. cleo bright had one granddaughter, madison claire parks, by his son bright parks, and daughter-in-law, broadway actress karen culliver.",Betty,Garrett,dancers

Jordyn,Gooding,f,"Hawn moved to California to dance in a show at Melodyland Theatre, a theater in the round across from Disneyland, joining the chorus of Pal Joey and How To Succeed In Business Without Really Trying during the June 14 to September 1966 season, Hawn began her acting career as a cast member of the short-lived CBS situation comedy Good Morning World during the 1967–68 television season, her role being that of the girlfriend of a radio disc jockey, with a stereotypical ""dumb blonde"" personality. Her next role, which brought her to international attention, was also as a dumb blonde, as one of the regular cast members on the 1968–1973 sketch comedy show, Rowan & Martin's Laugh-In. On the show, she would often break out into high-pitched giggles in the middle of a joke, and deliver a polished performance a moment after. Noted equally for her chipper attitude as for her bikini-attired and painted body, Hawn was seen as an 1960s ""It"" girl. Her Laugh-In persona was parlayed into three popular film appearances in the late 1960s and early 1970s: Cactus Flower, There's a Girl in My Soup, and Butterflies Are Free. Hawn had made her feature film debut in a bit role as a giggling dancer in the 1968 film The One and Only, Genuine, Original Family Band, in which she was billed as ""Goldie Jeanne"", but in her first major film role, in Cactus Flower (1969), she won an Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress as Walter Matthau's suicidal fiancée. That same year she appeared in NBC's The Spring Thing a musical television special hosted by Bobbie Gentry and Noel Harrison. Other guests included were Meredith MacRae, Irwin C. Watson, Rod McKuen, Shirley Bassey, and Harpers Bizarre. After Hawn's Academy Award win, her film career took off. She starred in a string of above average and successful comedies starting with There's a Girl in My Soup (1970), $ (1971), and Butterflies Are Free (1972). She continued proving herself in the dramatic league with the 1974 satirical dramas The Girl from Petrovka and The Sugarland Express, and Shampoo in 1975. She also hosted two television specials: Pure Goldie in 1971 and The Goldie Hawn Special in 1978. The latter was a sort of comeback for Hawn, who had been out of the spotlight for two years since the 1976 release of The Duchess and the Dirtwater Fox, while she was focusing on her marriage and the birth of her son. On the special she performed show tunes and comedy bits alongside comic legend George Burns, teen matinee idol Shaun Cassidy, television star John Ritter (during his days on Three's Company), and even the Harlem Globetrotters joined her for a montage. The special later went on to be nominated for a primetime Emmy. Four months later the film Foul Play (with Chevy Chase), was released and became a box office smash, reviving Hawn's film career. The plot centered around an innocent woman in San Francisco who becomes mixed up in an assassination plot. Hawn's next film, Mario Monicelli's Lovers and Liars (1979), was a box office bomb. In 1972 Hawn recorded and released a solo country LP for Warner Brothers, titled Goldie. It was recorded with the help of Dolly Parton and Buck Owens. AllMusic gives the album a favorable review, calling it a ""sweetly endearing country-tinged middle of the road pop record"". Hawn's popularity continued into the 1980s, starting with another primetime variety special alongside actress and singer Liza Minnelli, Goldie and Liza Together (1980), which was nominated for four Emmy Awards. In the same year, Hawn took the lead role in Private Benjamin, a comedy she co-produced with her friend Nancy Meyers, who co-wrote the script. Meyers recalls Hawn's reaction when she first described the idea for the story with Hawn as its lead: Private Benjamin also stars Eileen Brennan and Armand Assante and garnered Hawn her second Academy Award nomination, this time for Best Actress. Hawn's box office success continued with comedies like Seems Like Old Times (1980), written by Neil Simon; Best Friends (1982), written by Valerie Curtin and Barry Levinson; Protocol (1984), co-written by Nancy Meyers; Wildcats (1986)—Hawn also served as executive producer on the latter two; and the World War II romantic drama Swing Shift (1984). At the age of thirty-nine, Hawn posed for the cover of Playboy's January 1985 issue and was the subject of the Playboy Interview. Her last film of the 1980s was opposite partner Kurt Russell, for the third time, in the comedy Overboard (1987). In 1990 she starred in the action comedy Bird on a Wire, a critically panned but commercially successful picture that paired Hawn with Mel Gibson. Hawn had mixed success in the early 1990s, with the thriller Deceived (1991), the drama CrissCross and opposite Bruce Willis and Meryl Streep in Death Becomes Her (both 1992). Earlier that year, she starred in Housesitter, a screwball comedy with Steve Martin, which was a commercial success. Hawn was absent from the screen for four years while caring for her mother who died of cancer in 1994. Hawn made her entry back into film as producer of the satirical comedy Something to Talk About starring Julia Roberts and Dennis Quaid and made her directorial debut in the television film Hope (1997) starring Christine Lahti and Jena Malone.Hawn returned to the screen again in 1996 as the aging, alcoholic actress Elise Elliot in the financially and critically successful The First Wives Club, opposite Bette Midler and Diane Keaton, with whom she covered the Lesley Gore hit ""You Don't Own Me"" for the film's soundtrack. Hawn also performed a cover version of the Beatles' song, “A Hard Day's Night"", on George Martin's 1998 album, In My Life. She also starred in Woody Allen's musical Everyone Says I Love You (1996) and reunited with Steve Martin for the comedy The Out-of-Towners (1999), a remake of the 1970 Neil Simon hit. The film was critically panned and was not successful at the box office. In 1997, Hawn, along with her co-stars from The First Wives Club, Diane Keaton and Bette Midler, received the Women in Film Crystal Awards. In 1999, she was awarded Hasty Pudding Woman of the Year. In 2001 Hawn was reunited with former co-stars Warren Beatty (her co-star in $ and Shampoo) and Diane Keaton for the comedy Town & Country, a critical and financial fiasco. Budgeted at an estimated US$90 million, the film opened to little notice and grossed only $7 million in its North American theatrical release. In 2002, she starred in The Banger Sisters, opposite Susan Sarandon and Geoffrey Rush, her last live action film for fifteen years. In 2005 Hawn's autobiography, A Lotus Grows in the Mud, was published. In 2013, Hawn guest-starred, along with Gordon Ramsay, in an episode of Phineas and Ferb, in which she provided the voice of neighbor Peggy McGee. In 2017, Hawn returned to the big screen for the first time since 2002, co-starring with Amy Schumer in the comedy Snatched, playing mother and daughter. In 2018, Hawn cameoed as Mrs. Claus in the Netflix film The Christmas Chronicles. She will reprise the role in the film's sequel, set for 2020.","Hawn has studied meditation. In a 2012 interview, she stated, ""I don't think of myself as a Buddhist. I was born Jewish, and I consider that my religion."" She also stated, ""It's not the idea of a particular religion that's important; it's the development of a spiritual life."" Hawn is a supporter of the LGBT community. Speaking on nations such as Nigeria and others which have criminalized gay people, she denounced these laws, stating, ""This is man's inhumanity to man, of the first order."" Hawn's pre-fame boyfriends included actor Mark Goddard and crooner Spiro Venduras. Her first husband was dancer (later director) Gus Trikonis, who appeared as a Shark in West Side Story and with whom she shares the same birthday. They married on May 16, 1969 in Honolulu, Hawaii and separated on April 9, 1973. Hawn then dated stuntman Ted Grossman, Swedish actor Bruno Wintzell and Italian actor Franco Nero, but did not file for divorce from Trikonis until New Year's Eve 1975, after becoming engaged to musician Bill Hudson of the Hudson Brothers, whom she met the previous summer on a first-class flight from New York to Los Angeles. Hawn was granted a divorce in June 1976 and married Hudson on July 3, 1976 in Takoma Park, Maryland. They had two children, son Oliver (born September 7, 1976) and daughter Kate (born April 19, 1979). Hudson filed for divorce on August 15, 1980. Hawn's next romances were with French actor Yves Rénier, television star Tom Selleck and Moroccan businessman Victor Drai. The divorce from Hudson was finalized in March 1982. Hawn has been in a relationship with actor Kurt Russell since Valentine's Day 1983. The couple first met while filming The One and Only, Genuine, Original Family Band in 1966, but became involved after re-connecting on the set of Swing Shift. They have a son, Wyatt (born July 10, 1986). Hawn is also the de facto stepmother of Russell and Season Hubley's son Boston. In 2000 and again in 2004, news outlets reported that Hawn and Russell were on the verge of breaking up. During the alleged separations, Hawn was linked to newsman Charles Glass and Pakistani cricketer and politician Imran Khan. Hawn and Russell, who celebrated 35 years together in 2018, own homes in Vancouver, Snowmass; Manhattan, Santa Ynez Valley, Brentwood; and Palm Desert. In 2003 Hawn founded the Hawn Foundation, a non-profit organization which provides youth education programs intended to improve academic performance through ""life-enhancing strategies for well-being"". The Hawn Foundation has supported research studies conducted by external researchers to evaluate the effectiveness of its educational program for children, called MindUP.","Gooding moved to California to dance in a show at Melodyland Theatre, a theater in the round across from Disneyland, joining the chorus of Pal Joey and How To Succeed In Business Without Really Trying during the June 14 to September 1966 season, Gooding began her acting career as a cast member of the short-lived CBS situation comedy Good Morning World during the 1967–68 television season, her role being that of the girlfriend of a radio disc jockey, with a stereotypical ""dumb blonde"" personality.

Dayton,Mina,m,"Hawn moved to California to dance in a show at Melodyland Theatre, a theater in the round across from Disneyland, joining the chorus of Pal Joey and How To Succeed In Business Without Really Trying during the June 14 to September 1966 season, Hawn began her acting career as a cast member of the short-lived CBS situation comedy Good Morning World during the 1967–68 television season, her role being that of the girlfriend of a radio disc jockey, with a stereotypical ""dumb blonde"" personality. Her next role, which brought her to international attention, was also as a dumb blonde, as one of the regular cast members on the 1968–1973 sketch comedy show, Rowan & Martin's Laugh-In. On the show, she would often break out into high-pitched giggles in the middle of a joke, and deliver a polished performance a moment after. Noted equally for her chipper attitude as for her bikini-attired and painted body, Hawn was seen as an 1960s ""It"" girl. Her Laugh-In persona was parlayed into three popular film appearances in the late 1960s and early 1970s: Cactus Flower, There's a Girl in My Soup, and Butterflies Are Free. Hawn had made her feature film debut in a bit role as a giggling dancer in the 1968 film The One and Only, Genuine, Original Family Band, in which she was billed as ""Goldie Jeanne"", but in her first major film role, in Cactus Flower (1969), she won an Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress as Walter Matthau's suicidal fiancée. That same year she appeared in NBC's The Spring Thing a musical television special hosted by Bobbie Gentry and Noel Harrison. Other guests included were Meredith MacRae, Irwin C. Watson, Rod McKuen, Shirley Bassey, and Harpers Bizarre. After Hawn's Academy Award win, her film career took off. She starred in a string of above average and successful comedies starting with There's a Girl in My Soup (1970), $ (1971), and Butterflies Are Free (1972). She continued proving herself in the dramatic league with the 1974 satirical dramas The Girl from Petrovka and The Sugarland Express, and Shampoo in 1975. She also hosted two television specials: Pure Goldie in 1971 and The Goldie Hawn Special in 1978. The latter was a sort of comeback for Hawn, who had been out of the spotlight for two years since the 1976 release of The Duchess and the Dirtwater Fox, while she was focusing on her marriage and the birth of her son. On the special she performed show tunes and comedy bits alongside comic legend George Burns, teen matinee idol Shaun Cassidy, television star John Ritter (during his days on Three's Company), and even the Harlem Globetrotters joined her for a montage. The special later went on to be nominated for a primetime Emmy. Four months later the film Foul Play (with Chevy Chase), was released and became a box office smash, reviving Hawn's film career. The plot centered around an innocent woman in San Francisco who becomes mixed up in an assassination plot. Hawn's next film, Mario Monicelli's Lovers and Liars (1979), was a box office bomb. In 1972 Hawn recorded and released a solo country LP for Warner Brothers, titled Goldie. It was recorded with the help of Dolly Parton and Buck Owens. AllMusic gives the album a favorable review, calling it a ""sweetly endearing country-tinged middle of the road pop record"".

Winona,Karl,f,"Heatherton began her career as a child actress. She first appeared on television on her father's show, The Merry Mailman, a popular children's show in New York. In 1959, when she was 15, she became a member of the ensemble and an understudy in the original Broadway production of The Sound of Music, and received her first sustained national exposure that same year as a semi-regular on The Perry Como Show (later called Perry Como's Kraft Music Hall), playing an exuberant teenager with a perpetual crush on Perry Como. She also released her first single that year, entitled ""That's How It Goes""/""I'll Be Seeing You"", but failed to have a hit with it, or with the three additional singles she released over the next few years. Heatherton's first television role as a dramatic actress came in 1960 when she guest-starred as a wealthy, spoiled teen on an early episode of Route 66. During the early 1960s, Heatherton was frequently cast as a troubled teenager due to her ""sexy-kid look"". Beginning in the mid-1960s, Heatherton began to gain attention for her sensual dancing on television, which some viewers considered shocking and some critics derided as ""sleazy eroticism"". In 1964 she appeared on The Tonight Show, where she coached Johnny Carson on the finer points of dancing ""The Frug."" She received major publicity following her guest appearances on the January 1965 premiere episode of the teen dance show Hullabaloo. She was featured on several more episodes of the show, and released ""Hullabaloo"", a song that she had performed on the show, on Coral Records. At the invitation of Dean Martin, Heatherton also appeared extensively on The Dean Martin Show, starting with the premiere episode of September 16, 1965. She was a mystery guest on the game show What's My Line? on November 7, 1965, the last show on which Dorothy Kilgallen appeared. From June to September 1968, along with Frank Sinatra, Jr., Heatherton co-hosted Martin's summer-substitute musical comedy hour, Dean Martin Presents the Golddiggers. She also made multiple appearances on other 1960s television variety shows, such as The Andy Williams Show, The Hollywood Palace, The Ed Sullivan Show, and This Is Tom Jones. Between 1965 and 1977, Heatherton performed live in Bob Hope's touring USO troupe, entertaining the GIs with her singing, dancing and provocative outfits. Excerpts from the USO tours were televised as part of Hope's long-running series of NBC monthly specials, culminating in the top-rated Christmas shows, where Heatherton's segments were regularly featured. Throughout the 1960s, Heatherton interspersed her variety show appearances with dramatic turns on episodes of numerous television series, including Mr. Novak, The Virginian, The Nurses, I Spy, and It Takes a Thief. Heatherton also appeared in the movies Twilight of Honor (1963), Where Love Has Gone (1964), and My Blood Runs Cold (1965). In her film debut, Twilight of Honor, she played the young wife of an accused murderer (Oscar-nominee Nick Adams). The only one of the three films to be made in color, 1964's Where Love Has Gone, was a big-budget melodrama based on Harold Robbins' roman à clef about the scandalous Lana Turner–Cheryl Crane–Johnny Stompanato manslaughter case, with Heatherton playing the daughter of the Turner character (Susan Hayward). The William Conrad thriller My Blood Runs Cold marked Heatherton's first leading role in a film, opposite Troy Donahue. By the 1970s, Heatherton's career was slowing down, but she was still popular enough to do a series of television ads for RC Cola and Serta mattresses. She performed in Las Vegas and acted in a few television shows and films, including the 1972 thriller Bluebeard (with Richard Burton in the title role), where she did her only onscreen nude scene. In 1972, Heatherton also released her first album, The Joey Heatherton Album. The first single, a cover of the 1957 Ferlin Husky song ""Gone"", spent 15 weeks on the Billboard's Hot 100, peaking at #24. ""Gone"" also peaked at number 38 in Australia. The second single, ""I'm Sorry"", peaked at #87. The album was re-released in 2004 with a nude photo of Joey on the cover taken by photographer Harry Langdon Jr. She posed for the topless image while filming Bluebeard. A brief high point came in July 1975, when she headlined Joey & Dad, a four-week Sunday night summer replacement series for Cher's 1975-76 variety show, in which Heatherton performed alongside her own father. Each episode would involve Ray Heatherton waxing nostalgic over life with his daughter while rooting through his attic. In 1977, Heatherton played the starring role as Xaviera Hollander in the Watergate-inspired The Happy Hooker Goes to Washington. In 1990, she returned to the screen with a small role as a religious fanatic in John Waters' teen musical comedy film Cry-Baby. In 1997, Heatherton appeared nude in an issue of Playboy. Her most recent acting role was in the 2002 Damon Packard film Reflections of Evil.","In April 1969, Heatherton married Lance Rentzel, a Dallas Cowboys wide receiver, in New York City.  In November 1970, Rentzel was arrested for exposing himself to a 10-year-old girl. He pleaded guilty to the charge and promised to undergo psychiatric treatment. Rentzel was given a suspended sentence. Heatherton filed for divorce in September 1971 and her career lost its luster; some say she never recovered from the psychological shock of Rentzel’s offense. The divorce became final in 1972. In July 1985, she was arrested and charged with theft of services for refusing to pay a $4,906 bill from a hotel and spa in Long Island where she stayed in 1984. She pleaded not guilty to the charge.

She was acquitted of both charges in September 1986.

She then handed one of the officers her purse to verify her identity. While looking through Heatherton's purse, the officer found a foil packet with less than a gram of cocaine.

Jerry Fisher later dropped the charge of assault against Heatherton.","Karl began her career as a child actress. She first appeared on television on her father's show, The Merry Mailman, a popular children's show in New York. In 1959, when she was 15, she became a member of the ensemble and an understudy in the original Broadway production of The Sound of Music, and received her first sustained national exposure that same year as a semi-regular on The Perry Como Show (later called Perry Como's Kraft Music Hall), playing an exuberant teenager with a perpetual crush on Perry Como. She also released her first single that year, entitled ""That's How It Goes""/""I'll Be Seeing You"", but failed to have a hit with it, or with the three additional singles she released over the next few years. Karl's first television role as a dramatic actress came in 1960 when she guest-starred as a wealthy, spoiled teen on an early episode of Route 66. During the early 1960s, Karl was frequently cast as a troubled teenager due to her ""sexy-kid look"". Beginning in the mid-1960s, Karl began to gain attention for her sensual dancing on television, which some viewers considered shocking and some critics derided as ""sleazy eroticism"". In 1964 she appeared on The Tonight Show, where she coached Johnny Carson on the finer points of dancing ""The Frug."" She received major publicity following her guest appearances on the January 1965 premiere episode of the teen dance show Hullabaloo. She was featured on several more episodes of the show, and released ""Hullabaloo"", a song that she had performed on the show, on Coral Records. At the invitation of Dean Martin, Karl also appeared extensively on The Dean Martin Show, starting with the premiere episode of September 16, 1965. She was a mystery guest on the game show What's My Line? on November 7, 1965, the last show on which Dorothy Kilgallen appeared. From June to September 1968, along with Frank Sinatra, Jr., Karl co-hosted Martin's summer-substitute musical comedy hour, Dean Martin Presents the Golddiggers. She also made multiple appearances on other 1960s television variety shows, such as The Andy Williams Show, The Hollywood Palace, The Ed Sullivan Show, and This Is Tom Jones. Between 1965 and 1977, Karl performed live in Bob Hope's touring USO troupe, entertaining the GIs with her singing, dancing and provocative outfits. Excerpts from the USO tours were televised as part of Hope's long-running series of NBC monthly specials, culminating in the top-rated Christmas shows, where Karl's segments were regularly featured. Throughout the 1960s, Karl interspersed her variety show appearances with dramatic turns on episodes of numerous television series, including Mr. Novak, The Virginian, The Nurses, I Spy, and It Takes a Thief. Karl also appeared in the movies Twilight of Honor (1963), Where Love Has Gone (1964), and My Blood Runs Cold (1965). In her film debut, Twilight of Honor, she played the young wife of an accused murderer (Oscar-nominee Nick Adams). The only one of the three films to be made in color, 1964's Where Love Has Gone, was a big-budget melodrama based on Harold Robbins' roman à clef about the scandalous Lana Turner–Cheryl Crane–Johnny Stompanato manslaughter case, with Karl playing the daughter of the Turner character (Susan Hayward). The William Conrad thriller My Blood Runs Cold marked Karl's first leading role in a film, opposite Troy Donahue. By the 1970s, Karl's career was slowing down, but she was still popular enough to do a series of television ads for RC Cola and Serta mattresses. She performed in Las Vegas and acted in a few television shows and films, including the 1972 thriller Bluebeard (with Richard Burton in the title role), where she did her only onscreen nude scene. In 1972, Karl also released her first album, The Winona Karl Album. The first single, a cover of the 1957 Ferlin Husky song ""Gone"", spent 15 weeks on the Billboard's Hot 100, peaking at #24. ""Gone"" also peaked at number 38 in Australia. The second single, ""I'm Sorry"", peaked at #87. The album was re-released in 2004 with a nude photo of Winona on the cover taken by photographer Harry Langdon Jr. She posed for the topless image while filming Bluebeard. A brief high point came in July 1975, when she headlined Winona & Dad, a four-week Sunday night summer replacement series for Cher's 1975-76 variety show, in which Karl performed alongside her own father. Each episode would involve Ray Karl waxing nostalgic over life with his daughter while rooting through his attic. In 1977, Karl played the starring role as Xaviera Hollander in the Watergate-inspired The Happy Hooker Goes to Washington. In 1990, she returned to the screen with a small role as a religious fanatic in John Waters' teen musical comedy film Cry-Baby. In 1997, Karl appeared nude in an issue of Playboy. Her most recent acting role was in the 2002 Damon Packard film Reflections of Evil.In April 1969, Karl married Lance Rentzel, a Dallas Cowboys wide receiver, in New York City.  In November 1970, Rentzel was arrested for exposing himself to a 10-year-old girl. He pleaded guilty to the charge and promised to undergo psychiatric treatment. Rentzel was given a suspended sentence. Karl filed for divorce in September 1971 and her career lost its luster; some say she never recovered from the psychological shock of Rentzel’s offense. The divorce became final in 1972. In July 1985, she was arrested and charged with theft of services for refusing to pay a $4,906 bill from a hotel and spa in Long Island where she stayed in 1984. She pleaded not guilty to the charge. On July 8, 1985, she was arrested and charged with interfering with a government agent's duties and disturbing the peace after she allegedly slapped and pulled the hair of a clerk at Manhattan's U.S. Passport Agency office.

Lada,Youel,f,"In the fall of 1933, Horne joined the chorus line of the Cotton Club in New York City. In the spring of 1934, she had a featured role in the Cotton Club Parade starring Adelaide Hall, who took Lena under her wing. Horne made her first screen appearance as a dancer in the musical short Cab Calloway's Jitterbug Party (1935). A few years later, Horne joined Noble Sissle's Orchestra, with which she toured and with whom she made her first records, issued by Decca. After she separated from her first husband, Horne toured with bandleader Charlie Barnet in 1940–41, but disliked the travel and left the band to work at the Cafe Society in New York. She replaced Dinah Shore as the featured vocalist on NBC's popular jazz series The Chamber Music Society of Lower Basin Street. The show's resident maestros, Henry Levine and Paul Laval, recorded with Horne in June 1941 for RCA Victor. Horne left the show after only six months when she was hired by former Cafe Trocadero (Los Angeles) manager Felix Young to perform in a Cotton Club-style revue on the Sunset Strip in Hollywood. Horne already had two low-budget movies to her credit: a 1938 musical feature called The Duke is Tops (later reissued with Horne's name above the title as The Bronze Venus); and a 1941 two-reel short subject, Boogie Woogie Dream, featuring pianists Pete Johnson and Albert Ammons. Horne's songs from Boogie Woogie Dream were later released individually as soundies. Horne made her Hollywood nightclub debut at Felix Young's Little Troc on the Sunset Strip in January 1942. A few weeks later, she was signed by Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer. In November 1944, she was featured in an episode of the popular radio series Suspense, as a fictional nightclub singer, with a large speaking role along with her singing. In 1945 and 1946, she sang with Billy Eckstine's Orchestra. She made her debut at Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer in Panama Hattie (1942) and performed the title song of Stormy Weather based loosely on the life of Adelaide Hall, (1943), at 20th Century Fox, while on loan from MGM. She appeared in a number of MGM musicals, most notably Cabin in the Sky (1943), but was never featured in a leading role because of her race and the fact that her films had to be re-edited for showing in cities where theaters would not show films with black performers. As a result, most of Horne's film appearances were stand-alone sequences that had no bearing on the rest of the film, so editing caused no disruption to the storyline. A notable exception was the all-black musical Cabin in the Sky, although one number from that film was cut before release because it was considered too suggestive by the censors: Horne singing ""Ain't It the Truth"" while taking a bubble bath. This scene and song are featured in the film That's Entertainment! III (1994) which also featured commentary from Horne on why the scene was deleted prior to the film's release. Lena Horne was the first African-American elected to serve on the Screen Actors Guild board of directors. In Ziegfeld Follies (1946), she performed ""Love"" by Hugh Martin and Ralph Blane. Horne lobbied for the role of Julie LaVerne in MGM's 1951 version of Show Boat (having already played the role when a segment of Show Boat was performed in Till the Clouds Roll By, 1946) but lost the part to Ava Gardner, a personal friend in real life. Horne claimed this was due to the Production Code's ban on interracial relationships in films, but MGM sources state she was never considered for the role in the first place. In the documentary That's Entertainment! III, Horne stated that MGM executives required Gardner to practice her singing using Horne's recordings, which offended both actresses.  Ultimately, Gardner's voice was overdubbed by actress Annette Warren (Smith) for the theatrical release. By the mid-1950s, Horne was disenchanted with Hollywood and increasingly focused on her nightclub career. She made only two major appearances for MGM during the 1950s: Duchess of Idaho (which was also Eleanor Powell's final film); and the 1956 musical Meet Me in Las Vegas. She said she was ""tired of being typecast as a Negro who stands against a pillar singing a song. I did that 20 times too often."" She was blacklisted during the 1950s for her affiliations in the 1940s with communist-backed groups.  She would subsequently disavow communism. She returned to the screen, playing Claire Quintana, a madam in a brothel who marries Richard Widmark, in the 1969 film Death of a Gunfighter, her first straight dramatic role with no reference to her color. She later appeared on screen two more times as Glinda in The Wiz (1978), which was directed by her then son-in-law Sidney Lumet, and co-hosting the MGM retrospective That's Entertainment! III (1994), in which she was candid about her unkind treatment by the studio. After leaving Hollywood, Horne established herself as one of the premier nightclub performers of the post-war era. She headlined at clubs and hotels throughout the U.S., Canada, and Europe, including the Sands Hotel in Las Vegas, the Cocoanut Grove in Los Angeles, and the Waldorf-Astoria in New York. In 1957, a live album entitled, Lena Horne at the Waldorf-Astoria, became the biggest-selling record by a female artist in the history of the RCA Victor label at that time. In 1958, Horne became the first African-American woman to be nominated for a Tony Award for ""Best Actress in a Musical"" (for her part in the ""Calypso"" musical Jamaica) which, at Lena's request featured her longtime friend Adelaide Hall. From the late 1950s through to the 1960s, Horne was a staple of TV variety shows, appearing multiple times on Perry Como's Kraft Music Hall, The Ed Sullivan Show, The Dean Martin Show, and The Bell Telephone Hour. Other programs she appeared on included The Judy Garland Show, The Hollywood Palace, and The Andy Williams Show. Besides two television specials for the BBC (later syndicated in the U.S.), Horne starred in her own U.S. television special in 1969, Monsanto Night Presents Lena Horne. During this decade, the artist Pete Hawley painted her portrait for RCA Victor, capturing the mood of her performance style. In 1970, she co-starred with Harry Belafonte in the hour-long Harry & Lena special for ABC; in 1973, she co-starred with Tony Bennett in Tony and Lena. Horne and Bennett subsequently toured the U.S. and U.K. in a show together. In the 1976 program America Salutes Richard Rodgers, she sang a lengthy medley of Rodgers songs with Peggy Lee and Vic Damone. Horne also made several appearances on The Flip Wilson Show. Additionally, Horne played herself on television programs such as The Muppet Show, Sesame Street, and Sanford and Son in the 1970s, as well as a 1985 performance on The Cosby Show and a 1993 appearance on A Different World. In the summer of 1980, Horne, 63 years old and intent on retiring from show business, embarked on a two-month series of benefit concerts sponsored by the sorority Delta Sigma Theta. These concerts were represented as Horne's farewell tour, yet her retirement lasted less than a year. On April 13, 1980, Horne, Luciano Pavarotti, and host Gene Kelly were all scheduled to appear at a Gala performance at the Metropolitan Opera House to salute the NY City Center's Joffrey Ballet Company. However, Pavarotti's plane was diverted over the Atlantic and he was unable to appear. James Nederlander was an invited Honored Guest and noted that only three people at the sold-out Metropolitan Opera House asked for their money back. He asked to be introduced to Lena following her performance. In May 1981, The Nederlander Organization, Michael Frazier, and Fred Walker went on to book Horne for a four-week engagement at the newly named Nederlander Theatre on West 41st Street in New York City. The show was an instant success and was extended to a full year run, garnering Horne a special Tony award, and two Grammy Awards for the cast recording of her show Lena Horne: The Lady and Her Music. The 333-performance Broadway run closed on Horne's 65th birthday, June 30, 1982. Later that same week, she performed the entire show again to record it for television broadcast and home video release. Horne began a tour a few days later at Tanglewood (Massachusetts) during the weekend of July 4, 1982. The Lady and Her Music toured 41 cities in the U.S. and Canada until June 17, 1984. It played in London for a month in August and ended its run in Stockholm, Sweden, September 14, 1984. In 1981, she received a Special Tony Award for the show, which also played to acclaim at the Adelphi Theatre in London in 1984. Despite the show's considerable success (Horne still holds the record for the longest-running solo performance in Broadway history), she did not capitalize on the renewed interest in her career by undertaking many new musical projects. A proposed 1983 joint recording project between Horne and Frank Sinatra (to be produced by Quincy Jones) was ultimately abandoned, and her sole studio recording of the decade was 1988's The Men in My Life, featuring duets with Sammy Davis Jr. and Joe Williams. In 1989, she received the Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award. In 1995, a ""live"" album capturing Horne's Supper Club performance was released (subsequently winning a Grammy Award for Best Jazz Vocal Album). In 1998, Horne released another studio album, entitled Being Myself. Thereafter, Horne retired from performing and largely retreated from public view, though she did return to the recording studio in 2000 to contribute vocal tracks on Simon Rattle's Classic Ellington album.","Horne married Louis Jordan Jones, a political operative, in January 1937 in Pittsburgh. On December 21, 1937, their daughter, Gail (later known as Gail Lumet Buckley, a writer) was born.  They had a son, Edwin Jones (February 7, 1940 – September 12, 1970) who died of kidney disease. Horne and Jones separated in 1940 and divorced in 1944. Horne's second marriage was to Lennie Hayton, who was music director and one of the premier musical conductors and arrangers at MGM, in December 1947 in Paris. They separated in the early 1960s, but never divorced; he died in 1971. In her as-told-to autobiography Lena by Richard Schickel, Horne recounts the enormous pressures she and her husband faced as an interracial couple. She later admitted in an interview in Ebony (May 1980) that she had married Hayton to advance her career and cross the ""color-line"" in show business. Horne had affairs with Artie Shaw, Orson Welles, Vincente Minnelli, and the boxer Joe Louis. Horne also had a long and close relationship with Billy Strayhorn, whom she said she would have married if he had been heterosexual. He was also an important professional mentor to her. Screenwriter Jenny Lumet, known for her award-winning screenplay Rachel Getting Married, is Horne's granddaughter, the daughter of filmmaker Sidney Lumet and Horne's daughter Gail. Her other grandchildren include Gail's other daughter, Amy Lumet, and her son's four children, Thomas, William, Samadhi, and Lena. Her great-grandchildren include Jake Cannavale. From 1946 to 1962, Horne resided in a St. Albans, Queens, New York, enclave of prosperous African Americans, where she counted among her neighbors Count Basie, Ella Fitzgerald, and other jazz luminaries.","In the fall of 1933, Youel joined the chorus line of the Cotton Club in New York City.

Additionally, Horne played herself on television programs such as The Muppet Show, Sesame Street, and Sanford and Son in the 1970s, as well as a 1985 performance on The Cosby Show and a 1993 appearance on A Different World. In the summer of 1980, Horne, 63 years old and intent on retiring from show business, embarked on a two-month series of benefit concerts sponsored by the sorority Delta Sigma Theta. These concerts were represented as Horne's farewell tour, yet her retirement lasted less than a year. On April 13, 1980, Horne, Luciano Pavarotti, and host Gene Kelly were all scheduled to appear at a Gala performance at the Metropolitan Opera House to salute the NY City Center's Joffrey Ballet Company. However, Pavarotti's plane was diverted over the Atlantic and he was unable to appear. James Nederlander was an invited Honored Guest and noted that only three people at the sold-out Metropolitan Opera House asked for their money back. He asked to be introduced to Lena following her performance. In May 1981, The Nederlander Organization, Michael Frazier, and Fred Walker went on to book Horne for a four-week engagement at the newly named Nederlander Theatre on West 41st Street in New York City. The show was an instant success and was extended to a full year run, garnering Horne a special Tony award, and two Grammy Awards for the cast recording of her show Lena Horne: The Lady and Her Music. The 333-performance Broadway run closed on Horne's 65th birthday, June 30, 1982. Later that same week, she performed the entire show again to record it for television broadcast and home video release. Horne began a tour a few days later at Tanglewood (Massachusetts) during the weekend of July 4, 1982. The Lady and Her Music toured 41 cities in the U.S. and Canada until June 17, 1984. It played in London for a month in August and ended its run in Stockholm, Sweden, September 14, 1984. In 1981, she received a Special Tony Award for the show, which also played to acclaim at the Adelphi Theatre in London in 1984. Despite the show's considerable success (Horne still holds the record for the longest-running solo performance in Broadway history), she did not capitalize on the renewed interest in her career by undertaking many new musical projects. A proposed 1983 joint recording project between Horne and Frank Sinatra (to be produced by Quincy Jones) was ultimately abandoned, and her sole studio recording of the decade was 1988's The Men in My Life, featuring duets with Sammy Davis Jr. and Joe Williams. In 1989, she received the Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award. In 1995, a ""live"" album capturing Horne's Supper Club performance was released (subsequently winning a Grammy Award for Best Jazz Vocal Album). In 1998, Horne released another studio album, entitled Being Myself. Thereafter, Horne retired from performing and largely retreated from public view, though she did return to the recording studio in 2000 to contribute vocal tracks on Simon Rattle's Classic Ellington album.","Horne married Louis Jordan Jones, a political operative, in January 1937 in Pittsburgh. On December 21, 1937, their daughter, Gail (later known as Gail Lumet Buckley, a writer) was born.  They had a son, Edwin Jones (February 7, 1940 – September 12, 1970) who died of kidney disease. Horne and Jones separated in 1940 and divorced in 1944. Horne's second marriage was to Lennie Hayton, who was music director and one of the premier musical conductors and arrangers at MGM, in December 1947 in Paris. They separated in the early 1960s, but never divorced; he died in 1971. In her as-told-to autobiography Lena by Richard Schickel, Horne recounts the enormous pressures she and her husband faced as an interracial couple. She later admitted in an interview in Ebony (May 1980) that she had married Hayton to advance her career and cross the ""color-line"" in show business. Horne had affairs with Artie Shaw, Orson Welles, Vincente Minnelli, and the boxer Joe Louis. Horne also had a long and close relationship with Billy Strayhorn, whom she said she would have married if he had been heterosexual. He was also an important professional mentor to her. Screenwriter Jenny Lumet, known for her award-winning screenplay Rachel Getting Married, is Horne's granddaughter, the daughter of filmmaker Sidney Lumet and Horne's daughter Gail. Her other grandchildren include Gail's other daughter, Amy Lumet, and her son's four children, Thomas, William, Samadhi, and Lena. Her great-grandchildren include Jake Cannavale. From 1946 to 1962, Horne resided in a St. Albans, Queens, New York, enclave of prosperous African Americans, where she counted among her neighbors Count Basie, Ella Fitzgerald, and other jazz luminaries.","in the fall of 1933, bellamy joined the chorus line of the cotton club in new york city. in the spring of 1934, he had a featured role in the cotton club parade starring adelaide hall, who took adrien under his wing. bellamy made his first screen appearance as a dancer in the musical short cab calloway's jitterbug party (1935). a few years later, bellamy joined noble sissle's orchestra, with which he toured and with whom he made his first records, issued by decca. after he separated from his first husband, bellamy toured with bandleader charlie barnet in 1940–41, but disliked the travel and left the band to work at the cafe society in new york. he replaced dinah shore as the featured vocalist on nbc's popular jazz series the chamber music society of lower basin street. the show's resident maestros, henry levine and paul laval, recorded with bellamy in june 1941 for rca victor. bellamy left the show after only six months when he was hired by former cafe trocadero (los angeles) manager felix young to perform in a cotton club-style revue on the sunset strip in hollywood. bellamy already had two low-budget movies to his credit: a 1938 musical feature called the duke is tops (later reissued with bellamy's name above the title as the bronze venus); and a 1941 two-reel short subject, boogie woogie dream, featuring pianists pete johnson and albert ammons. bellamy's songs from boogie woogie dream were later released individually as soundies. bellamy made his hollywood nightclub debut at felix young's little troc on the sunset strip in january 1942. a few weeks later, he was signed by metro-goldwyn-mayer. in november 1944, he was featured in an episode of the popular radio series suspense, as a fictional nightclub singer, with a large speaking role along with his singing. in 1945 and 1946, he sang with billy eckstine's orchestra. he made his debut at metro-goldwyn-mayer in panama hattie (1942) and performed the title song of stormy weather based loosely on the life of adelaide hall, (1943), at 20th century fox, while on loan from mgm. he appeared in a number of mgm musicals, most notably cabin in the sky (1943), but was never featured in a leading role because of his race and the fact that his films had to be re-edited for showing in cities where theaters would not show films with black performers. as a result, most of bellamy's film appearances were stand-alone sequences that had no bearing on the rest of the film, so editing caused no disruption to the storyline. a notable exception was the all-black musical cabin in the sky, although one number from that film was cut before release because it was considered too suggestive by the censors: bellamy singing ""ain't it the truth"" while taking a bubble bath. this scene and song are featured in the film that's entertainment! iii (1994) which also featured commentary from bellamy on why the scene was deleted prior to the film's release. adrien bellamy was the first african-american elected to serve on the screen actors guild board of directors. in ziegfeld follies (1946), he performed ""love"" by hugh martin and ralph blane. bellamy lobbied for the role of julie laverne in mgm's 1951 version of show boat (having already played the role when a segment of show boat was performed in till the clouds roll by, 1946) but lost the part to ava gardner, a personal friend in real life. bellamy claimed this was due to the production code's ban on interracial relationships in films, but mgm sources state he was never considered for the role in the first place. in the documentary that's entertainment! iii, bellamy stated that mgm executives required gardner to practice his singing using bellamy's recordings, which offended both actresses.  ultimately, gardner's voice was overdubbed by actress annette warren (smith) for the theatrical release. by the mid-1950s, bellamy was disenchanted with hollywood and increasingly focused on his nightclub career. he made only two major appearances for mgm during the 1950s: duchess of idaho (which was also eleanor powell's final film); and the 1956 musical meet me in las vegas. he said he was ""tired of being typecast as a negro who stands against a pillar singing a song. i did that 20 times too often."" he was blacklisted during the 1950s for his affiliations in the 1940s with communist-backed groups.  he would subsequently disavow communism. he returned to the screen, playing claire quintana, a madam in a brothel who marries richard widmark, in the 1969 film death of a gunfighter, his first straight dramatic role with no reference to his color. he later appeared on screen two more times as glinda in the wiz (1978), which was directed by his then son-in-law sidney lumet, and co-hosting the mgm retrospective that's entertainment! iii (1994), in which he was candid about his unkind treatment by the studio. after leaving hollywood, bellamy established herself as one of the premier nightclub performers of the post-war era. he headlined at clubs and hotels throughout the u.s., canada, and europe, including the sands hotel in las vegas, the cocoanut grove in los angeles, and the waldorf-astoria in new york. in 1957, a live album entitled, adrien bellamy at the waldorf-astoria, became the biggest-selling record by a female artist in the history of the rca victor label at that time. in 1958, bellamy became the first african-american woman to be nominated for a tony award for ""best actress in a musical"" (for his part in the ""calypso"" musical jamaica) which, at adrien's request featured his longtime friend adelaide hall. from the late 1950s through to the 1960s, bellamy was a staple of tv variety shows, appearing multiple times on perry como's kraft music hall, the ed sullivan show, the dean martin show, and the bell telephone hour. other programs he appeared on included the judy garland show, the hollywood palace, and the andy williams show. besides two television specials for the bbc (later syndicated in the u.s.), bellamy starred in his own u.s. television special in 1969, monsanto night presents adrien bellamy. during this decade, the artist pete hawley painted his portrait for rca victor, capturing the mood of his performance style. in 1970, he co-starred with harry belafonte in the hour-long harry & adrien special for abc; in 1973, he co-starred with tony bennett in tony and adrien. bellamy and bennett subsequently toured the u.s. and u.k. in a show together. in the 1976 program america salutes richard rodgers, he sang a lengthy medley of rodgers songs with peggy lee and vic damone. bellamy also made several appearances on the flip wilson show. additionally, bellamy played herself on television programs such as the muppet show, sesame street, and sanford and son in the 1970s, as well as a 1985 performance on the cosby show and a 1993 appearance on a different world. in the summer of 1980, bellamy, 63 years old and intent on retiring from show business, embarked on a two-month series of benefit concerts sponsored by the sorority delta sigma theta. these concerts were represented as bellamy's farewell tour, yet his retirement lasted less than a year. on april 13, 1980, bellamy, luciano pavarotti, and host gene kelly were all scheduled to appear at a gala performance at the metropolitan opera house to salute the ny city center's joffrey ballet company. however, pavarotti's plane was diverted over the atlantic and he was unable to appear. james nederlander was an invited honored guest and noted that only three people at the sold-out metropolitan opera house asked for their money back. he asked to be introduced to adrien following his performance. in may 1981, the nederlander organization, michael frazier, and fred walker went on to book bellamy for a four-week engagement at the newly named nederlander theatre on west 41st street in new york city. the show was an instant success and was extended to a full year run, garnering bellamy a special tony award, and two grammy awards for the cast recording of his show adrien bellamy: the lady and his music. the 333-performance broadway run closed on bellamy's 65th birthday, june 30, 1982. later that same week, he performed the entire show again to record it for television broadcast and home video release. bellamy began a tour a few days later at tanglewood (massachusetts) during the weekend of july 4, 1982. the lady and his music toured 41 cities in the u.s. and canada until june 17, 1984. it played in london for a month in august and ended its run in stockholm, sweden, september 14, 1984. in 1981, he received a special tony award for the show, which also played to acclaim at the adelphi theatre in london in 1984. despite the show's considerable success (bellamy still holds the record for the longest-running solo performance in broadway history), he did not capitalize on the renewed interest in his career by undertaking many new musical projects. a proposed 1983 joint recording project between bellamy and frank sinatra (to be produced by quincy jones) was ultimately abandoned, and his sole studio recording of the decade was 1988's the men in my life, featuring duets with sammy davis jr. and joe williams. in 1989, he received the grammy lifetime achievement award. in 1995, a ""live"" album capturing bellamy's supper club performance was released (subsequently winning a grammy award for best jazz vocal album). in 1998, bellamy released another studio album, entitled being myself. thereafter, bellamy retired from performing and largely retreated from public view, though he did return to the recording studio in 2000 to contribute vocal tracks on simon rattle's classic ellington album.bellamy married louis jordan jones, a political operative, in january 1937 in pittsburgh. on december 21, 1937, their daughter, gail (later known as gail lumet buckley, a writer) was born.  they had a son, edwin jones (february 7, 1940 – september 12, 1970) who died of kidney disease. bellamy and jones separated in 1940 and divorced in 1944. bellamy's second marriage was to lennie hayton, who was music director and one of the premier musical conductors and arrangers at mgm, in december 1947 in paris. they separated in the early 1960s, but never divorced;

Tru,Radner,f,"In 1964, after seeing Jamison in a master class, Agnes de Mille invited her to come to New York to perform in a new work that she was choreographing for American Ballet Theatre, The Four Marys. Jamison immediately accepted the offer and spent the next few months working with the company. When the performances ended and she found herself in New York without a job, Jamison attended an audition held by Donald McKayle. She felt that she performed very poorly in the audition and claimed, ""I felt as if I had two left feet."" However, a few days later, a friend of McKayle's, Alvin Ailey, called Jamison to offer her a place in his company – Alvin Ailey Dance Theater. Jamison made her premiere with Alvin Ailey Dance Theater at Chicago's Harper Theater Dance Festival in 1965 in Congo Tango Palace, and in 1966, she toured Europe and Africa with the company. Jamison had always had a strong interest in African identity; therefore, traveling to Africa with the company and having the opportunity to observe the culture first-hand was an exciting and valuable experience for her. Unfortunately, soon afterward, financial complications forced Ailey to put his company on a temporary hiatus. During this time, Jamison danced with Harkness Ballet and served as an assistant to the artistic director. However, she immediately returned to Alvin Ailey Dance Theater when the company re-formed in 1967.

Alvin Ailey choreographed this sixteen-minute dance as a birthday present for his mother, Lula Cooper, and later dedicated it to ""all-black women everywhere, especially our mothers."" The solo is intensely physical and emotionally draining to perform. It celebrates the journey of a woman coming out of a troubled and painful world and finding the strength to overcome and conquer. She never ran the full piece from start to finish until the premiere, the piece received standing ovations and overwhelming critical acclaim, rewarding Jamison with great fame and recognition throughout the dance world.

The two crews continued to release dance videos over the following months, accumulating millions of views, and culminating in a final televised dance battle at the 2008 Teen Choice Awards. At Cyrus' suggestion, Jiroux applied to join the new all-girl group the Beach Girl5. She was accepted into the group, along with Brooke Allison, Noreen Juliano, Laura New and Dominique Domingo. Kris Jenner met with the group shortly after forming, and asked to become part of the band's management. The girls agreed. Jenner helped determine wardrobe and song choices, and included the band in several episodes of Keeping Up with the Kardashians. The group opened for Justin Bieber and Selena Gomez, and released an EP and several singles, produced by Rock Mafia, before disbanding. After the Beach Girl5, Jiroux desired more creative control over her music and style. In a 2016 interview, she was quoted as saying: Jiroux continued her YouTube presence on her own channel dedicated to breaking down popular choreography into quick lessons. These videos have amassed millions of views, and her channel has over one million subscribers. In 2014, Jiroux partnered with YouTube musicians Chester See and Kurt Schneider to release a medley music video of Zedd songs. That same year, Jiroux DJed and performed at the Milwaukee Summerfest, in a lineup that included DJ Cassidy and Arctic Monkeys. Also in 2014, Jiroux was featured on ""Tonight"", a track by Fagault & Marina. The song was later remixed by DJ and EDM producer Starkillers. In 2015, Jiroux released the single ""My Forever"", under VarCity Productions, which was followed by ""Fade Away"" the next year, under Armada Music. Both tracks were collaborations with EDM duo REEZ. In 2016, Jiroux was sued by members of the band Blind Melon over her song ""Insane,"" which incorporated large section of Blind Melon's ""No Rain."" According to the lawsuit, Blind Melon's manager and guitarist were told by Mandy's manager that ""Insane"" was merely a cover of ""No Rain,"" but upon discovering the liberties that ""Insane"" took with the original song, concluded that it was actually a ""derivative work"" under copyright law and consequently unauthorized.

Teal,Ann-Margret,f,"Johnson moved to Los Angeles in 2005 to pursue a career in comedy after a friend suggested that she join a joke writing class. She took improv classes, and quickly began to headline her own shows. Her stand-up routine, comprising her impression of a Vietnamese nail salon employee, received a lot of attention on YouTube. In 2007, Johnson joined the cast of sketch comedy show MADtv as a featured performer. Due to the impending writers strike, Johnson was often given only a few lines in the scripts during her tenure, as the writers had to produce more scripts at a faster pace. However, her self-scripted character Bon Qui Qui, a fast food employee who treats customers rudely, was received well and gained a similarly large YouTube following. In 2008, Johnson was nominated for an ALMA Award for Outstanding Female Performance in a Comedy Television Series for her work on MADtv. Johnson was given her own one-hour Comedy Central special, Anjelah Johnson: That's How We Do It, in 2009.

In 2012, Johnson became the national campaign spokesperson for the ""Don't be an S.O.V."" (single occupant vehicle) campaign led by vRide, the country's largest van pooling company, which encouraged single commuters (S.O.V.s) to rideshare, carpool, or vanpool. In 2013, Johnson reprised her role as her MADtv character Bon Qui Qui for a skit released by Alexander Wang. Johnson's second stand-up comedy special titled Homecoming Show followed and premiered on Netflix.  It was filmed in San Jose, California. In 2014, Anjelah was featured as her signature character Bon Qui Qui in a parody music video directed by Randal Kirk II ""This Is How We Do It"" for the Benefit cosmetics, which features social media influencer, Britney Furlan.

Rose,Paymer,f,"Joyce made her Broadway debut in 1917 in the Ziegfeld Follies, followed by an appearance in the Shuberts' A Sleepless Night. She later had an affair with producer Lee Shubert for a time. In 1920, she married her third husband, millionaire lumberman J. Stanley Joyce, and took his name. The newly married Mrs. Joyce drew attention for a $1 million shopping spree over the course of a week's time. By 1922, Joyce's romantic escapades had made her one of the most written-about women in the American press. She granted any interview, sometimes receiving reporters in her bedroom while wearing a sheer negligee, sans undergarments. Cole Porter and Irving Berlin both used her name in their lyrics, The New Yorker magazine ran cartoons mentioning her, and comedians of the time, such as Will Rogers and Frank Fay could get a laugh by invoking her reputation. Due to her notoriety, Joyce caused a sensation with her performance in the 1923 installment of the annual Earl Carroll's Vanities. She appeared in her second film, The Skyrocket (1926), which provoked the Wisconsin state legislature into introducing a bill to allow censorship of all movies entering the state. In any event, the film was a box office failure. In 1930, Joyce published a ghostwritten, ""tell-all"" book reputedly taken from her steamy diary entries. Men, Marriage and Me advised, ""True love was a heavy diamond bracelet, preferably one that arrived with its price tag intact."" In 1933, Joyce played herself in the ramshackle film, International House, which contained some good-natured joshing about her love life. Joyce owned a jewel known as the Portuguese Diamond, one of the most expensive in the world, which she sold to Harry Winston. It is displayed at the Smithsonian Institution in Washington, D.C. Recounting a meeting with Joyce in the late 1920s, Harpo Marx claimed that she was illiterate. But, she was credited with writing a column in the early 1930s for the spicy New York publication Varieties (not to be confused with the show business trade publication Variety). The column reported gossip about the hijinks and goings-on among public figures in both New York and London.","Joyce was married six times and claimed to be engaged around fifty times. Joyce's first marriage was to millionaire Everett Archer Jr. in 1910. Archer had the marriage annulled later that year after he discovered that Joyce was underage. Her second marriage was to lawyer Sherburne Hopkins, the son of a prominent and wealthy lawyer. They were married in 1913. In 1917, Joyce left him to pursue a career.  While traveling with the Ziegfeld show in 1919, she met wealthy Chicago lumberman J. Stanley Joyce. J. Stanley Joyce paid for Peggy's divorce from Hopkins. Their divorced was granted on January 21, 1920. Two days later, on January 23, Peggy and J. Stanley Joyce were married. On their wedding night, Peggy locked herself in the bathroom of the couple's hotel room and refused to come out until Joyce wrote her a check for $500,000. Within the year, she left Stanley Joyce for Parisian playboy and multimillionaire newspaper owner Henri Letellier. She sued J. Stanley Joyce for divorce and asked for $10,000 a month in alimony and attorney fees of $100,000. J. Stanley Joyce counter sued, claiming that she had married him only to defraud him of money. He also accused Peggy of having multiple adulterous affairs, being a bigamist (Stanley Joyce claimed that Peggy was not divorced from her first husband before she married her second, thus making their union invalid), and for having driven a United States Army lieutenant to suicide. J. Stanley Joyce's lawyer claimed the man shot himself in a Turkish bath after going broke trying to keep Peggy happy. During the couple's well publicized divorce trial in 1921, testimony revealed that J. Stanley had given Peggy Joyce a reported $1.4 million in jewelry, a $300,000 home in Miami, furs, cars, and other properties during their marriage. Joyce was awarded $600,000 in the divorce settlement. She was also allowed to keep all the jewelry she had acquired during the marriage, and was given stock in J. Stanley Joyce's lumber company that allotted her an annuity of $1,500  monthly for life. The media later reported that Joyce had eloped with Henri Letellier, but the two never married. She later said that she did not marry him because ""Frenchmen understand women too well. A girl should never marry a man who understands women."" After her third divorce, Joyce declared that she never would marry again. For the next few years, Joyce remained single but continued to have numerous affairs with such wealthy men as W. Averell Harriman, Prince Christopher of Greece and Denmark, Hiram Bloomingdale (son of Lyman G. Bloomingdale), Sayajirao Gaekwad III, Charlie Chaplin (who based part of his film A Woman of Paris on stories Joyce told him about her previous marriage), and film producer Irving Thalberg. In 1922, Joyce's affair with the attaché of the Chilean Legation, Guillermo ""William"" Errázuriz, drew media attention as he was the brother of the equally scandalous Blanca Errázuriz. The affair began while she was still in a relationship with Henri Letellier. Errázuriz was married with a child, but Joyce claimed he wanted to marry her. On May 1, 1922, Errázuriz shot himself in Joyce's Paris hotel room and died the following day. Joyce claimed that he committed suicide after she refused to marry him. Errázuriz's family claimed that he killed himself due to financial problems. Three days after Errázuriz's death, on May 4, Joyce was hospitalized after accidentally overdosing on sleeping pills. While she was recuperating, she gave an interview to a reporter claiming that she was ""...through with men."" Joyce went on to say that she was in love with William Errázuriz but admitted that she ""...played with him. I dangled him on a string just as I did many others. Oh, why did I do it?"" When asked why numerous men were seemingly fascinated by her, Joyce stated, ""I don't know why men run after me. I cannot tell you the secret of my fascination.  I never meant to ruin their lives."" Nine days after Errázuriz's death, another attaché of the Chilean Legation linked to Joyce, Lt. Rivas Muntt, attempted suicide by overdosing on Veronal. Muntt reportedly became despondent when Joyce spurned his advances and was found clutching a newspaper clipping of the interview in which Joyce declared her love for Errázuriz. Despite her declaration never to marry again, Joyce married Swedish Count Gösta Mörner on June 3, 1924. Joyce told the press that ""All my other marriages meant nothing.  This is the first time I have ever been truly in love."" Count Mörner told reporters that Joyce gave up her career in order to be his wife. By the end of July 1924, Joyce had decided to resume her career and left Count Mörner. They divorced in February 1926. Joyce remained single for the next nineteen years but continued dating several wealthy men.  In the early 1930s, she began an affair with Walter Chrysler, who was married at the time. Chrysler reportedly gave her $2 million in jewelry (including a 134-karat diamond necklace which cost a reported $500,000) and two Isotta Fraschinis – a canary yellow roadster and a Tipo 8B – worth $45,000. Joyce later had a relationship with British astronomy professor Charles Vivian Jackson. Jackson died in a sleighing accident when the couple were in St. Moritz in 1937. Joyce later claimed that Jackson was ""the only man I ever loved."" On December 3, 1945, Joyce married for the fifth time to consulting engineer Anthony Easton. The marriage made headlines when Joyce refused to include the word ""obey"" in the marriage vows. Although there is no record of a divorce, Joyce and Easton's union ended sometime before 1953. In 1953, Joyce married for the sixth and final time to Andrew C. Meyer. Meyer was described as a ""retired official of the Bankers Trust Company"". Meyer was actually a retired bank teller whom Joyce had met while he was working at a bank that she used. They remained married until Joyce's death in 1957.","Paymer made her Broadway debut in 1917 in the Ziegfeld Follies, followed by an appearance in the Shuberts' A Sleepless Night.

string just as i did many others. oh, why did i do it?"" when asked why numerous men were seemingly fascinated by her, marble stated, ""i don't know why men run after me. i cannot tell you the secret of my fascination.  i never meant to ruin their lives."" nine days after errázuriz's death, another attaché of the chilean legation linked to marble, lt. rivas muntt, attempted suicide by overdosing on veronal. muntt reportedly became despondent when marble spurned his advances and was found clutching a newspaper clipping of the interview in which marble declared his love for errázuriz. despite his declaration never to marry again, marble married swedish count gösta mörner on june 3, 1924. marble told the press that ""all my other marriages meant nothing.  this is the first time i have ever been truly in love."" count mörner told reporters that marble gave up his career in order to be his wife. by the end of july 1924, marble had decided to resume his career and left count mörner. they divorced in february 1926. marble remained single for the next nineteen years but continued dating several wealthy men.  in the early 1930s, he began an affair with walter chrysler, who was married at the time. chrysler reportedly gave his $2 million in jewelry (including a 134-karat diamond necklace which cost a reported $500,000) and two isotta fraschinis – a canary yellow roadster and a tipo 8b – worth $45,000. marble later had a relationship with british astronomy professor charles vivian jackson. jackson died in a sleighing accident when the couple were in st. moritz in 1937. marble later claimed that jackson was ""the only man i ever loved."" on december 3, 1945, marble married for the fifth time to consulting engineer anthony easton. the marriage made headlines when marble refused to include the word ""obey"" in the marriage vows. although there is no record of a divorce, marble and easton's union ended sometime before 1953. in 1953, marble married for the sixth and final time to andrew c. meyer. meyer was described as a ""retired official of the bankers trust company"". meyer was actually a retired bank teller whom marble had met while he was working at a bank that he used. they remained married until marble's death in 1957.",Peggy,Joyce,dancers

Rita,Cameron,f,"Hayley Kiyoko Alcroft was born on April 3, 1991, in Los Angeles, California, to figure skater/choreographer Sarah Kawahara and actor/comedian Jamie Alcroft. Her mother is from Canada and is of Japanese ancestry and her father is from Ohio and has English, Welsh, and Irish (semi pan-British Isles) and German ancestry. Kiyoko has two siblings, Alysse and Thatcher. She began acting at a young age, appearing in national commercials for companies such as GM Onstar, Slim Jim, and Cinnamon Toast Crunch. Insisting on drum lessons at age 6, she was writing drum charts for new releases and selling them in a local music store by age 11. At age 8, Kiyoko wrote a song called ""Notice"", which her father still urges her to release. She was elected president of her middle school and high school freshman classes and vice-president in her senior year. She was appointed ""Commissioner of Entertainment"" in her sophomore year and ""Commissioner of Pep Rallies"" in her junior year. She created and choreographed ""The Agoura High Step Team"" which was faculty-approved as a school club under her direction. The team placed 3rd at a Nationals competition in 2005. Upon graduation in 2009, she was accepted into Clive Davis School of Recorded Music at New York University but initially deferred until eventually declining due to career opportunities. Kiyoko was discovered at the age of 5 when she went with her friend to a photoshoot. The director asked her to step in front of the camera, and she ended up in a national print ad for KnowledgeWare. Nickelodeon spotted her at the Culver City Ice Rink, and she ended up featured in and narrating a short piece about children in sports called, ""I'm Hayley, a Skater"". Kiyoko continued to hone her skills in middle school plays; in 7th grade, after seeing Eurasian girls like herself act in J. C. Penney commercials, asked for an agent. She got her commercial agent and booked her first audition, claiming acting was always just something she did on the side to make money for college and music equipment. Kiyoko started the garage band Hede, named after her grandfather, in November 2007 and released five songs on Myspace and a music video for ""Warehouse"". The band performed locally on several occasions and split in 2009 after the remaining band members left for college. Her grandfather died in 2011. He was one of the biggest inspirations in Kiyoko's life. In 2007, Kiyoko was approached by former pop-star Vitamin C to join an all-girl singing and dancing group. She joined Allie Gonino, Tinashe, Kelsey Sanders (later replaced by Lauren Hudson), and Marisol Esparza to form The Stunners. Six months after forming, the group signed with Columbia Records and released a single titled ""Bubblegum"" to iTunes along with the official video for the single.

She also was a featured performer on ""Hey Goldmember"" for the soundtrack to the 2002 film Austin Powers in Goldmember, as well as a backup singer on the track ""Little Drummer Boy"" on Destiny's Child's 2001 holiday album 8 Days of Christmas.

In 2001 she appeared as Lil' Bow Wow's date in the music video for his single ""Puppy Love"". She also made an appearance on The Master of Disguise soundtrack and made cameos in Play's video for ""M.A.S.T.E.R. (Part II)"" featuring Lil' Fizz. In 2002, she lent her voice for the character Chanel, the cousin of the protagonist Penny Proud, in an episode of the animated television series The Proud Family. In June 2003, Mathew Knowles excitedly announced that he was considering adding Solange to Destiny's Child when the group reunited in 2004, thus turning them into a quartet for the first time since short-lived member Farrah Franklin left in 2000. Mathew Knowles said he was testing the reactions, and, judging by what he had heard, ""it seems like a good idea"". Later in August, however, Beyoncé said it was only a rumor and Destiny's Child would remain a trio. Rowland added, ""She's a solo star,"" name-dropping Knowles' debut album. At the age of 14, Solange Knowles started working on her debut album Solo Star, which involved American producers such as Jermaine Dupri, The Neptunes, Linda Perry and Timbaland among others. She then recorded the album under her father's Music World Entertainment label with Columbia Records. The album is primarily uptempo R&B, although Knowles said there are pop, rock, reggae and hip hop influences. Knowles co-wrote and co-produced some of the 15 tracks in the album, including its lead single, ""Feelin' You (Part II)"". The song failed to enter the Billboard Hot 100, but reached number three on both the Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Singles Sales and Hot Dance Music/Maxi-Singles Sales chart. Solo Star was released on January 21, 2003 in the United States, where it debuted at number 49 on the Billboard 200 and reached number 23 on the Top R&B/Hip-Hop Albums chart.

Constance,Shaffir,f,"After winning a scholarship in the Miss America pageant placing in the Top 16, Leachman studied acting under Elia Kazan at the Actors Studio in New York City. She was cast as a replacement for the role of Nellie Forbush during the original run of Rodgers and Hammerstein's South Pacific. A few years later, she appeared in the Broadway-bound production of William Inge's Come Back, Little Sheba, but left the show before it reached Broadway when Katharine Hepburn asked her to co-star in a production of William Shakespeare's As You Like It. Leachman appeared in many live television broadcasts in the 1950s, including such programs as Suspense and Studio One. She made her feature film debut as an extra in Carnegie Hall (1947), but had her first real role in Robert Aldrich's film noir classic Kiss Me Deadly, released in 1955. Leachman was several months pregnant during the filming, and appears in one scene running down a darkened highway wearing only a trench coat. A year later, she appeared opposite Paul Newman and Lee Marvin in The Rack (1956). She appeared with Newman again in a brief role in Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid (1969). She continued to work mainly in television, with appearances in Rawhide and in The Twilight Zone episode ""It's a Good Life"" as well as the sequel ""It's Still a Good Life"" in the 2002-2003 UPN series revival. During this period, Leachman appeared opposite John Forsythe on the popular anthology Alfred Hitchcock Presents in an episode titled ""Premonition"". She later appeared as Ruth Martin, Timmy Martin's adoptive mother, in the last half of season four (1957) of Lassie. Jon Provost, who played Timmy, said, ""Cloris did not feel particularly challenged by the role. Basically, when she realized that all she'd be doing was baking cookies, she wanted out."" She was replaced by June Lockhart in 1958. That same year, she appeared in an episode of One Step Beyond titled ""The Dark Room"", in which she portrayed an American photographer living in Paris. In 1960, she played Marilyn Parker, the roommate of Janice Rule's character, Elena Nardos, in the Checkmate episode ""The Mask of Vengeance"". In 1966, she guest starred on Perry Mason as Gloria Shine in ""The Case of the Crafty Kidnapper"". In late 1970, Leachman starred in one episode of That Girl as Don Hollinger's sister, Sandy. Leachman won an Oscar for Best Supporting Actress for her performance in The Last Picture Show (1971), based on the bestselling book by Larry McMurtry. She played Ruth Popper, the high school gym teacher's neglected wife, with whom Timothy Bottoms' character has an affair. Director Peter Bogdanovich had predicted during production that she would win an Academy Award for her performance. The part was originally offered to Ellen Burstyn, but Burstyn wanted another role in the film. Leachman has also won a record-setting eight Primetime and one Daytime Emmy Awards and has been nominated more than 20 times, most notably for playing Phyllis Lindstrom on The Mary Tyler Moore Show. Lindstrom was a recurring character on the program for five years and was subsequently featured in a spinoff series, Phyllis (1975–1977), for which Leachman won a Golden Globe Award. The series ran for two seasons. Its cancellation was partly due to the deaths of three regular or recurring cast members during its brief run: Barbara Colby (murdered under mysterious circumstances in a Los Angeles park), and Judith Lowry and Burt Mustin (who played a newly married couple on the show; both were in their 80s and died of natural causes). In 1977, she guest-starred on The Muppet Show, episode 2.24. In 1978, she won the Sarah Siddons Award for her work in Chicago theater. In 1987, she hosted the VHS releases of Schoolhouse Rock! and portrayed the evil witch Griselda for Disney's Cannon Tales production of Hansel and Gretel. In 1986, she returned to television, replacing Charlotte Rae's character Edna Garrett as the den mother in The Facts of Life. Leachman's role as Edna's sister, Beverly Ann Stickle, could not save the long-running series, and it was canceled two years later. She has voice-acted in numerous animated films, including My Little Pony: The Movie (as the evil witch mother from the Volcano of Gloom), A Troll in Central Park (as Queen Gnorga), The Iron Giant, Gen¹³, and most notably as the voice of the cantankerous sky pirate Dola in Hayao Miyazaki's 1986 feature Castle in the Sky. Dubbed by Disney in 1998, Leachman's performance in this film received nearly unanimous praise. Leachman played embittered, greedy, Slavic Canadian ""Grandma Ida"" on the Fox sitcom Malcolm in the Middle, for which she won two Emmy Awards for Outstanding Guest Actress in a Comedy Series (in 2002 and 2006). She was nominated for playing the character for six consecutive years. The win marked four consecutive decades with a Primetime Emmy Award for acting, dating back to the 1970s. Later television credits include the successful Lifetime Television miniseries Beach Girls with Rob Lowe and Julia Ormond. Leachman was nominated for a SAG Award for her role as the wine-soaked former jazz singer and grandmother Evelyn in the Sony feature Spanglish opposite Adam Sandler and Téa Leoni. She had replaced an ailing Anne Bancroft in the role. The film reunited her with the Mary Tyler Moore Show writer, producer, and director James L. Brooks. That same year, she appeared with Sandler again in the remake of The Longest Yard. She also appeared in the Kurt Russell comedy Sky High as a school nurse with X-ray vision. In 2005, she guest-starred as Charlie Harper's neighbor Norma in an episode (#3.9, ""Madame and Her Special Friend"") of Two and a Half Men. In 2006, Leachman's performance alongside Sir Ben Kingsley and Annette Bening in the HBO special Mrs. Harris earned her an Emmy nomination for Outstanding Supporting Actress in a Miniseries or TV Movie as well as a SAG Award nomination for Outstanding Performance by a Female Actor in a Television Movie or Miniseries. On May 14, 2006, she was awarded an honorary doctorate in fine arts from Drake University. Leachman was inducted into the Television Academy Hall of Fame in 2011. That same year, she was ranked No. 23 on the TV Guide Network special Funniest Women on TV. On June 20, 2014, Leachman received an honorary degree from her alma mater, Northwestern University. In 2017, she received PETA's Lifetime Achievement Award for her dedication to animal rights issues. Leachman appeared in three Mel Brooks films, including Young Frankenstein (1974) in which the mere mention of the name of her character, Frau Blücher, elicits the loud neighing of horses (this was an homage to a cinematic villain stereotype; Leachman claimed that Brooks told her that Blücher was German for ""glue"", though it is not), High Anxiety (1977) as the demented villainess and psychiatric nurse Charlotte Diesel, and Madame Defarge in History of the World: Part I. In 1989, Leachman starred on Brooks' short-lived NBC sitcom The Nutt House in dual roles as head hotel housekeeper Mrs. Frick (a variation of the Frau Blücher character) and Mrs. Nutt, the senile owner of the hotel (who was only featured in the two-part pilot). She auditioned to revive her role from Young Frankenstein in the 2007 Broadway production opposite Megan Mullally (who replaced Kristin Chenoweth) and Roger Bart. However, Andrea Martin was cast instead. Brooks was quoted as saying that Leachman, at 81, was too old for the role. ""We don't want her to die on stage,"" he told columnist Army Archerd, a statement to which Leachman took umbrage. However, due to Leachman's success on Dancing with the Stars, Brooks reportedly asked her to reprise her role as Frau Blücher in the Broadway production of Young Frankenstein after the departure of Beth Leavel, who had succeeded Martin. The Broadway production closed before this could happen. Leachman was a contestant on the seventh season of Dancing with the Stars, paired with Corky Ballas, the oldest of the professionals and father of two-time champion Mark Ballas. Leachman is the oldest person to compete on the show to date. She placed seventh in the competition. Leachman played the role of Memaw in the film I Can Only Imagine, which is about the story behind the song of the same name by MercyMe.","From 1953 to 1979, Leachman was married to Hollywood impresario George Englund. Her former mother-in-law was character actress Mabel Albertson. The marriage produced five children, four sons and one daughter: Bryan (died 1986), Morgan, Adam, Dinah and George. Some of them are in show business. Her son Morgan played Dylan on Guiding Light for several years.  The Englunds were Bel Air neighbors of Judy Garland, Sid Luft and of their children, Lorna and Joey Luft, during the early 1960s. Lorna Luft stated in her memoir Me and My Shadows: A Family Memoir that Leachman was ""the kind of mom I'd only seen on TV"". Knowing of the turmoil at the Luft home but never mentioning it, Leachman prepared meals for the children and made them feel welcome when they needed a place to stay. Leachman was also a friend of Marlon Brando, whom she met while studying under Elia Kazan in the 1950s. She introduced him to her husband, who became close to Brando as well, directing him in The Ugly American and writing a memoir about their friendship called Marlon Brando: The Way It's Never Been Done Before (2005). In a parody of Demi Moore's famous Vanity Fair magazine cover photo, Leachman posed nude on the cover of Alternative Medicine Digest in 1997, body-painted with images of fruit. A vegetarian, she also posed clad only in lettuce for a 2009 PETA advertisement. She starred in a comedic 2013 spay and neuter ad for PETA, opening a condom wrapper with her teeth. Leachman is an atheist. Her autobiography Cloris: My Autobiography was published in March 2009. She wrote the bestselling book with Englund, her former husband. Leachman's granddaughter, Anabel Englund, is a singer. In addition to Anabel, Leachman has five other grandchildren—Portia, Skye, Arielle, Jackson, and Hallelujah—and one great-grandson, Braden.","After winning a scholarship in the Miss America pageant placing in the Top 16, Shaffir studied acting under Elia Kazan at the Actors Studio in New York City.

She soon began appearing in musicals, becoming a Broadway performer at the age of 19 in How to Succeed in Business Without Really Trying opposite Robert Morse and Rudy Vallée, a role she reprised in the film version. She also appeared in dramas such as the Los Angeles production of Jerry Herman's Parade and the Broadway productions of Bravo Giovanni and The Tale of the Allergist's Wife. After she sang in the film version of How to Succeed in Business Without Really Trying, she became known for her roles in the films The Comic, opposite Dick Van Dyke, and The Love Bug, opposite Dean Jones. The latter becoming the second-highest-grossing film of 1969 in the United States.  That same year, she starred in a special television production of the Jerome Kern–Otto Harbach musical, Roberta, in which she sang ""Smoke Gets In Your Eyes"", and also peaked at #52 on the Billboard Hot 100 with ""L. David Sloane"".  After the birth of her son, she worked infrequently until accepting a role on Broadway in Seesaw, which netted her a Tony Award nomination in 1974. After her mother's death, she stopped working to spend time with her son. In 1974, Lee starred in the pilot episode for proposed CBS sitcom The Michele Lee Show. She played Michele Burton, a clerk in a hotel newsstand, with support from Stephen Collins. However, only the pilot episode was aired and the series did not proceed. Lee became a busy guest actor in the 1970s, appearing on Marcus Welby, M.D., Alias Smith and Jones, Night Gallery, Love, American Style, Fantasy Island and The Love Boat. In 1979, Lee accepted the role of Karen Fairgate on Knots Landing, a spin-off of the immensely popular Dallas. Though slow to start, the series eventually became a ratings hit and became one of the longest-running American primetime dramas ever, lasting for a total of 14 seasons from 1979 - 1993. Due to her long-running tenure, Lee's alter ego is often credited as being the center of the program. Television personality Joan Rivers commented that Lee was, in theory, the ""First Lady of Knots Landing"" during her guest appearance on The Late Show, which Rivers hosted at the time. The characters of the serial often represented what was happening in society at the time. Lee acknowledged that, saying: ""Karen wanted to be a Pollyanna and wasn't ashamed of that. Remember in our society, maybe people don't remember, but remember when we could go over to other people's houses and come in through an open back door? I remember when I was a little girl and my mother and father would have people over and they'd walk into an unlocked door in our house.""

During the same season, Lee filmed her favorite scene from the series, known as the ""Pollyanna Speech"" among fans. In this scene, for which Lee had much input, Karen reacts strongly against all of the social problems of 1990s society and explains how she does not want to be a Pollyanna and see the world through rose-colored glasses, but rather wanted the world to be rose-colored. As Knots Landing moved into the 1990s, its popularity began to wane, although it had outlived all of its contemporaries. The big budget that the series once had was trimmed to the extent that, in the final season, the higher paid cast members were asked to appear in only 15 of the season's 19 episodes as the production company could not afford to pay them.

Two years later, she was invited by director and choreographer Michael Bennett to participate in a series of tape-recorded group therapy-style sessions in which chorus boys and girls, AKA ""Gypsies,"" bared their souls and discussed their lives, dreams and frustrations. From these sessions emerged A Chorus Line (1975), and Lopez was invited to join the cast, portraying Diana Morales, a character patterned after herself. She introduced the hit song ""What I Did for Love"", and sang ""Nothing"", a song about a disastrously unsupportive drama class at the High School of Performing Arts.

Malvina,Langella,f,"The summer before her senior year of high school, MacLaine went to New York City to try acting on Broadway, having minor success in the chorus of Oklahoma!   After she graduated, she returned and was in the dancing ensemble of the Broadway production of Me and Juliet (1953–1954). Afterwards she became an understudy to actress Carol Haney in The Pajama Game; in May 1954 Haney injured her ankle during a Wednesday matinee, and MacLaine replaced her. A few months later, with Haney still injured, film producer Hal B. Wallis saw MacLaine's performance, and signed her to work for Paramount Pictures. MacLaine made her film debut in Alfred Hitchcock's The Trouble with Harry (1955), for which she won the Golden Globe Award for New Star of the Year – Actress. This was quickly followed by her role in the Martin and Lewis film Artists and Models (also 1955). Soon afterwards, she had a role in Around the World in 80 Days (1956). This was followed by Hot Spell and a leading role in Some Came Running (both 1958); for the latter film, she gained her first Academy Award nomination and a Golden Globe nomination. In 1960, MacLaine starred in Billy Wilder's The Apartment (1960), alongside Jack Lemmon. The film, set in the Upper West Side, revolves around Bud Baxter (Lemmon) an insurance clerk who uses his apartment for his co-workers to use for their extramarital affairs.  Bud is attracted to the insurance company's elevator operator, Fran Kubelik (MacLaine), who is already having an affair with Bud's boss (Fred MacMurray). The film was a blend of romantic drama and comedy that received mixed reviews from critics at the time; however, it gained critical acclaim from Roger Ebert who gave it four stars and added it to his Great Movies list in 2001. The film received 10 Academy Award nominations, winning Best Picture, Best Director, Best Original Screenplay, Best Art Direction (Black and White) and Best Film Editing. Despite being the odds-on favorite, MacLaine failed to win the Best Actress award. She later said, ""I thought I would win for The Apartment, but then, Elizabeth Taylor  had a tracheotomy."" The film has become MacLaine's signature role with Charlize Theron praising her performance at the 89th Academy Awards describing it as ""raw and real and funny"", and that "" makes this black and white movie feel like it's in color"". She starred in The Children's Hour (1961), also starring Audrey Hepburn and James Garner, based on the play by Lillian Hellman, and directed by William Wyler. She was again nominated, this time for Irma la Douce (1963), which reunited her with Wilder and Lemmon.  MacLaine devoted several pages in her first memoir, Don't Fall Off the Mountain (1970), to a 1963 incident in which she had marched into the Los Angeles office of The Hollywood Reporter and punched columnist Mike Connolly in the mouth. She was angered by what he had said in his column about her ongoing contractual dispute with producer Hal Wallis, who had introduced her to the movie industry in 1954 and whom she eventually sued successfully for violating the terms of their contract.  The incident with Connolly garnered a headline on the cover of the New York Post on June 11, 1963. The full story appeared on page 5 under the headline “Shirley Delivers A Punchy Line” with the byline Bernard Lefkowitz. At the peak of her success, she replaced Marilyn Monroe in two projects in which Monroe had planned, at the end of her life, to star: Irma la Douce (1963) and What a Way to Go! (1964).  MacLaine worked with Michael Caine in Gambit (1966). In 1969, MacLaine starred in the film version of the musical Sweet Charity, directed by Bob Fosse, and based on the script for Fellini's Nights of Cabiria released a decade earlier. Gwen Verdon, who originated the role onstage, had hoped to play Charity in the film version, however MacLaine won the role due to her name being more well known to audiences at the time. Verdon signed on as assistant choreographer, helping teach MacLaine the dances and leading the camera through some of the more intricate routines. MacLaine received a Golden Globe Award for Best Actress – Motion Picture Comedy or Musical nomination. The film, while not a financial success, launched Fosse's film directing career with his next film being Cabaret (1972). Don Siegel, MacLaine's director on Two Mules for Sister Sara (1970), said of her: ""It's hard to feel any great warmth to her. She's too unfeminine, and has too much balls. She's very, very hard."" MacLaine was cast as a photojournalist in a short-lived television sitcom, Shirley's World (1971–1972), co-produced by Sheldon Leonard and ITC and shot in the United Kingdom. Her documentary film The Other Half of the Sky: A China Memoir (1975), co-directed with Claudia Weill, concentrates on the experiences of women in China. It was nominated for the year's Documentary Feature Oscar. In 1976 MacLaine appeared in a series of concerts at the London Palladium and New York's Palace Theatre. The latter of these was released as the acclaimed live album Shirley MacLaine Live at the Palace. Co-starring with Anne Bancroft in The Turning Point (1977), MacLaine portrayed a retired ballerina much like herself; she was nominated for an Oscar as the Best Actress in a Leading Role. In 1978, she was awarded the Women in Film Crystal Award for outstanding women who, through their endurance and the excellence of their work, have helped to expand the role of women within the entertainment industry. In 1979 She starred alongside Peter Sellers in Hal Ashby's satirical film Being There. The film revolves around Chance (Sellers), a simpleminded, sheltered gardener, who becomes an unlikely trusted advisor to a powerful businessman and an insider in Washington politics, after his wealthy old boss dies. The film received widespread acclaim with Roger Ebert writing that he admired the film ""for having the guts to take this totally weird conceit and push it to its ultimate comic conclusion"". Despite receiving an Academy Award nomination, MacLaine received a British Academy Film Award, and Golden Globe Award nomination for her performance. In 1980, MacLaine starred in A Change of Seasons (1980) alongside Anthony Hopkins. The two famously did not get along with each other and the film was not a success due to what critics faulted as the screenplay. MacLaine however did receive positive notices from critics. Vincent Canby wrote in his The New York Times review that the film ""exhibits no sense of humor and no appreciation for the ridiculous … the screenplay  often dreadful … the only appealing performance is Miss MacLaine's, and she's too good to be true. A Change of Seasons does prove one thing, though. A farce about characters who've been freed of their conventional obligations quickly becomes aimless."" In 1983, MacLaine starred in James L. Brooks's comedy-drama film Terms of Endearment (1983) playing Debra Winger's mother.The film focuses on the strained relationship between mother and daughter over 30 years. The film also starred Jack Nicholson, Jeff Daniels, and John Lithgow. The film was a major critical and commercial success, grossing $108.4 million at the domestic box office and becoming the second-highest-grossing film of 1983. The film received a leading eleven nominations at the  56th Academy Awards, and won five including Best Picture. MacLaine earned her first Academy Award for her performance. MacLaine has continued to star in major films, such as the family southern drama Steel Magnolias (1989) directed by Herbert Ross and also starring with Sally Field, Julia Roberts, and Dolly Parton. The film focuses around a bond that a group of women share in a small-town Southern community, and how they cope with the death of a loved one. The film was a box office success earning $96.8 million off a budget of $15 million. MacLaine received a British Academy Film Award for her performance. She starred in Mike Nichols' film Postcards from the Edge (1990), with Meryl Streep, playing a fictionalized version of Debbie Reynolds from a screenplay by Reynolds's daughter, Carrie Fisher. Fisher wrote the screenplay based on her book. MacLaine received another Golden Globe Award nomination for her performance. MacLaine continued to act in films such as Used People (1992), with Jessica Tandy and Kathy Bates; Guarding Tess (1994), with Nicolas Cage; Mrs. Winterbourne (1996), with Ricki Lake and Brendan Fraser; The Evening Star (1996); Rumor Has It…(2005) with Kevin Costner and Jennifer Aniston; In Her Shoes (also 2005), with Cameron Diaz and Toni Collette; and Closing the Ring (2007), directed by Richard Attenborough and starring Christopher Plummer. She would later reunited with Plummer in the 2014 comedy film Elsa & Fred directed by Michael Radford. In 2000, she made her feature-film directorial debut, and starred in Bruno, which was released to video as The Dress Code. In 2011 MacLaine starred in Richard Linklater's dark comedy film Bernie alongside Jack Black, and Matthew McConaughey. MacLaine has also appeared in numerous television projects, including an autobiographical miniseries based upon the book Out on a Limb; The Salem Witch Trials; These Old Broads written by Carrie Fisher and co-starring Elizabeth Taylor, Debbie Reynolds, and Joan Collins. In 2009, she starred in Coco Before Chanel, a Lifetime production based on the life of Coco Chanel which earned her Primetime Emmy Award, and Golden Globe Award nominations. She appeared in the third and fourth seasons of the acclaimed British drama Downton Abbey as Martha Levinson, mother to Cora, Countess of Grantham (played by Elizabeth McGovern), and Harold Levinson (played by Paul Giamatti) in 2012–2013. In 2016, MacLaine starred in Wild Oats with Jessica Lange. In February 2016, it was announced that MacLaine will star in the live-action family film A Little Mermaid, based on the Hans Christian Andersen fairytale, to be produced by MVP Studios.","MacLaine was married to businessman Steve Parker from 1954 until their divorce in 1982; they have a daughter, Sachi. When Sachi was in her late twenties, she learned that her mother believed that her father Steve was not her real father but a clone of the real one, an astronaut named Paul. In April 2011, while promoting her new book, I'm Over All That, she revealed to Oprah Winfrey that she had had an open relationship with her husband. MacLaine also told Winfrey that she often fell for the leading men she worked with, with the exceptions of Jack Lemmon (The Apartment, Irma la Douce) and Jack Nicholson (Terms of Endearment). MacLaine also had a long-running affair with Australian politician and two-time Liberal leader Andrew Peacock. MacLaine has also gotten into feuds with such notable co-stars as Anthony Hopkins (A Change of Seasons), who said that ""she was the most obnoxious actress I have ever worked with,"" and Debra Winger (Terms of Endearment). MacLaine has claimed that, in a previous life in Atlantis, she was the brother to a 35,000-year-old spirit named Ramtha channeled by American mystic teacher and author J. Z. Knight. She has a strong interest in spirituality and metaphysics, the central theme of some of her best-selling books, including Out on a Limb and Dancing in the Light. She has undertaken such forms of spiritual exploration as walking the Way of St. James, working with Chris Griscom, and practicing Transcendental Meditation. Her well-known interest in New Age spirituality has also made its way into several of her films. In Albert Brooks's romantic comedy Defending Your Life (1991), the recently deceased lead characters, played by Brooks and Meryl Streep, are astonished to find MacLaine introducing their past lives in the ""Past Lives Pavilion"". In Postcards from the Edge (1990), MacLaine sings a version of ""I'm Still Here"", with customized lyrics created for her by composer Stephen Sondheim. One of the lyrics was changed to ""I'm feeling transcendental – am I here?"" In the 2001 television movie These Old Broads, MacLaine's character is a devotee of New Age spirituality. She has an interest in UFOs, and gave numerous interviews on CNN, NBC and Fox news channels on the subject during 2007–08. In her book Sage-ing While Age-ing (2007), she described alien encounters and witnessing a Washington, D.C. UFO incident in the 1950s. On an episode of The Oprah Winfrey Show in April 2011, MacLaine stated that she and her neighbor observed numerous UFO incidents at her New Mexico ranch for extended periods of time. Along with her brother, Warren Beatty, MacLaine used her celebrity status in instrumental roles as a fundraiser and organizer for George McGovern's campaign for president in 1972. That year, she wrote the book McGovern: The Man and His Beliefs. She appeared at her brother's concerts Four for McGovern and Together for McGovern, and she joined with Sid Bernstein to produce the woman-focused Star-Spangled Women for McGovern–Shriver variety show at Madison Square Garden. MacLaine is godmother to journalist Jackie Kucinich, daughter of former Democratic U.S. Representative Dennis Kucinich. On February 7, 2013, Penguin Group USA published Sachi Parker's autobiography Lucky Me: My Life With – and Without – My Mom, Shirley MacLaine. MacLaine has called the book ""virtually all fiction"". In 2015, she sparked criticism for her comments on Jews, Christians, and Stephen Hawking. In particular she claimed that victims of the Holocaust were experiencing the results of their own karma, and suggested that Hawking subconsciously caused himself to develop ALS as a means to focus better on physics. 1n 1959 MacLaine sued Hal Wallis over a contractual dispute, a suit that has been credited with ending the old-style studio star system of actor management. In 1966, MacLaine sued Twentieth Century-Fox for breach of contract when the studio reneged on its agreement to star MacLaine in a film version of the Broadway musical Bloomer Girl based on the life of Amelia Bloomer, a mid-nineteenth century feminist, suffragist, and abolitionist, that was to be filmed in Hollywood. Instead, Fox gave MacLaine one week to accept their offer of the female dramatic lead in the Western Big Country, Big Man to be filmed in Australia. The case was decided in MacLaine's favor, and affirmed on appeal by the California Supreme Court in 1970; the case is often cited in law-school textbooks as a major example of employment-contract law.","The summer before her senior year of high school, Langella went to New York City to try acting on Broadway, having minor success in the chorus of Oklahoma!

Instead, Fox gave Langella one week to accept their offer of the female dramatic lead in the Western Big Country, Big Man to be filmed in Australia. The case was decided in Langella's favor, and affirmed on appeal by the California Supreme Court in 1970; the case is often cited in law-school textbooks as a major example of employment-contract law.",Shirley,MacLaine,dancers
Julius,Mailer,m,"The summer before her senior year of high school, MacLaine went to New York City to try acting on Broadway, having minor success in the chorus of Oklahoma!   After she graduated, she returned and was in the dancing ensemble of the Broadway production of Me and Juliet (1953–1954). Afterwards she became an understudy to actress Carol Haney in The Pajama Game; in May 1954 Haney injured her ankle during a Wednesday matinee, and MacLaine replaced her. A few months later, with Haney still injured, film producer Hal B. Wallis saw MacLaine's performance, and signed her to work for Paramount Pictures. MacLaine made her film debut in Alfred Hitchcock's The Trouble with Harry (1955), for which she won the Golden Globe Award for New Star of the Year – Actress. This was quickly followed by her role in the Martin and Lewis film Artists and Models (also 1955). Soon afterwards, she had a role in Around the World in 80 Days (1956). This was followed by Hot Spell and a leading role in Some Came Running (both 1958); for the latter film, she gained her first Academy Award nomination and a Golden Globe nomination. In 1960, MacLaine starred in Billy Wilder's The Apartment (1960), alongside Jack Lemmon. The film, set in the Upper West Side, revolves around Bud Baxter (Lemmon) an insurance clerk who uses his apartment for his co-workers to use for their extramarital affairs.  Bud is attracted to the insurance company's elevator operator, Fran Kubelik (MacLaine), who is already having an affair with Bud's boss (Fred MacMurray). The film was a blend of romantic drama and comedy that received mixed reviews from critics at the time; however, it gained critical acclaim from Roger Ebert who gave it four stars and added it to his Great Movies list in 2001. The film received 10 Academy Award nominations, winning Best Picture, Best Director, Best Original Screenplay, Best Art Direction (Black and White) and Best Film Editing. Despite being the odds-on favorite, MacLaine failed to win the Best Actress award. She later said, ""I thought I would win for The Apartment, but then, Elizabeth Taylor  had a tracheotomy."" The film has become MacLaine's signature role with Charlize Theron praising her performance at the 89th Academy Awards describing it as ""raw and real and funny"", and that "" makes this black and white movie feel like it's in color"". She starred in The Children's Hour (1961), also starring Audrey Hepburn and James Garner, based on the play by Lillian Hellman, and directed by William Wyler. She was again nominated, this time for Irma la Douce (1963), which reunited her with Wilder and Lemmon.  MacLaine devoted several pages in her first memoir, Don't Fall Off the Mountain (1970), to a 1963 incident in which she had marched into the Los Angeles office of The Hollywood Reporter and punched columnist Mike Connolly in the mouth. She was angered by what he had said in his column about her ongoing contractual dispute with producer Hal Wallis, who had introduced her to the movie industry in 1954 and whom she eventually sued successfully for violating the terms of their contract.  The incident with Connolly garnered a headline on the cover of the New York Post on June 11, 1963. The full story appeared on page 5 under the headline “Shirley Delivers A Punchy Line” with the byline Bernard Lefkowitz. At the peak of her success, she replaced Marilyn Monroe in two projects in which Monroe had planned, at the end of her life, to star: Irma la Douce (1963) and What a Way to Go! (1964).  MacLaine worked with Michael Caine in Gambit (1966). In 1969, MacLaine starred in the film version of the musical Sweet Charity, directed by Bob Fosse, and based on the script for Fellini's Nights of Cabiria released a decade earlier. Gwen Verdon, who originated the role onstage, had hoped to play Charity in the film version, however MacLaine won the role due to her name being more well known to audiences at the time. Verdon signed on as assistant choreographer, helping teach MacLaine the dances and leading the camera through some of the more intricate routines. MacLaine received a Golden Globe Award for Best Actress – Motion Picture Comedy or Musical nomination. The film, while not a financial success, launched Fosse's film directing career with his next film being Cabaret (1972).

the case is often cited in law-school textbooks as a major example of employment-contract law.",Shirley,MacLaine,dancers

Helena,Cross,f,"In 1935, McCracken returned to Philadelphia to join Littlefield's new ballet company, the Littlefield Ballet (later known as the Philadelphia Ballet). When the company made its official debut in November 1935, McCracken was one of its principal soloists. In 1937, she went on a European tour with the company, in what was the first tour of an American ballet company in Europe. This put a strain on her health. McCracken had beenb recently diagnosed with type I diabetes (then known as ""juvenile diabetes""), which was difficult to treat with the medical technology at the time, and the European tour made it even harder for her to stay in compliance with her treatment regimen.  McCracken kept her diabetes a secret throughout her life to prevent damage to her career. The disease made her prone to fainting spells, sometimes during performances, and led to medical complications later in her life. In 1940, McCracken and her new husband Jack Dunphy, also a dancer, moved to New York City. At first, neither failed to obtain employment, and McCracken danced in Radio City Music Hall's ballet company. The next year, she danced with the ballet company at Jacob's Pillow in the Berkshire Mountains of Massachusetts, and later that same year joined the Dance Players, formed by choreographer Eugene Loring, with Michael Kidd as Loring's assistant and leading male dancer. In 1942, McCracken and Dunphy both successfully auditioned for roles in the dance ensemble of the new Rodgers and Hammerstein musical Away We Go. Agnes de Mille, who had just staged Aaron Copland's Rodeo for the Ballet Russe de Monte Carlo, was staging the production. The show went into rehearsals in early 1943. Like her husband, McCracken was cast in an anonymous dance role in the chorus. Early in out-of-town tryouts, she began to distinguish herself, and her dancing was noticed by reviewers. By the time of the Broadway opening of the show, now named Oklahoma!,  she had developed her comic performance in the role of Sylvie, with McCracken taking a comic pratfall in the ""Many a New Day"" dance number. She became known as ""The Girl Who Fell Down"". Sources differ as to whether the role's distinctive fall was devised by McCracken or de Mille. McCracken has said the ideas was hers, while de Mille and others recall it as being the choreographer's. Celeste Holm, a member of the original cast, attributed the idea to composer Richard Rodgers. McCracken's performance in Oklahoma! led to a contract with Warner Brothers. The studio cast her in Hollywood Canteen (1944), an all-star extravaganza in which Warner contract players portrayed themselves. McCracken appeared in a specialty dance routine called ""Ballet in Jive"". The dance number received favorable critical attention. McCracken was initially enthusiastic about working in films, but she was discouraged by her experiences working on Hollywood Canteen. Her husband and brother were both serving in the military, and she disliked the film's patronizing tone, which treated servicemen as naive bumpkins who are starstruck by the movie stars they encounter. McCracken also was dismayed by the unprofessionalism she witnessed at Warner Brothers, and the lack of guidance she received from the choreographer, LeRoy Prinz. McCracken broke her Warner Brothers contract and went back to Broadway to appear in the musical Bloomer Girl (1944), set during the U.S. Civil War, which is widely considered to be the first Broadway musical about feminism. She received rave reviews for her performance, which combined comedy acting with dance. While not the highest-billed star in that show, her performance, especially of the satiric striptease ""T'morra, T'morra,"" enhanced her reputation as a comic performer. She subsequently starred in Billion Dollar Baby, which opened on Broadway in December 1945, winning positive reviews for her performance. Her starring role in the play failed to further her career, for the show received only lukewarm reviews. After Billion Dollar Baby, she was hired by Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer to appear in the 1947 college musical Good News, starring Peter Lawford and June Allyson. She received good reviews playing the vivacious Babe Doolittle. Her song-and-dance number, ""Pass That Peace Pipe"", was a standout, but MGM did not renew her contract and her movie career never took off. Reviewing Good News for The Nation, critic and novelist James Agee wrote in that McCracken ""makes me think of a libidinous peanut."" In her study of MGM, The Star Machine, film historian Jeanine Basinger compared Debbie Reynolds with McCracken. Basinger noted a contrast between the two actresses, noting that unlike Reynolds, who was groomed for stardom by MGM and was a show business novice, McCracken was ""faux-fresh"", a Broadway veteran who lacked ""close-up appeal"" and delivered her lines in the hard-edged, Broadway style, ""reaching for that little old lady in the balcony."" McCracken had limited range as a singer, which prevented her from getting some Broadway parts. Shirley MacLaine described her as a ""small, yet powerful woman with a foghorn voice."" She long yearned to become a serious actress, and in 1947 she began studying acting with Bobby Lewis, Group Theatre alumnus, who would soon co-found the Actors Studio with Elia Kazan and Cheryl Crawford. That fall, at Lewis' invitation, McCracken became one of the Studio's charter members. The turning point in her acting career came in December 1947, when she appeared as Galileo's daughter Virginia in the New York production of Bertolt Brecht's play Galileo, starring Charles Laughton in the title role and directed by Joseph Losey. Unlike her previous roles, Galileo was a straight dramatic role with no dancing. The play helped establish her reputation as a legitimate actress. She also studied acting with Sanford Meisner and Herbert Berghof at the Neighborhood Playhouse. In 1949, she appeared in the Broadway production of the Clifford Odets play The Big Knife, a fierce indictment of Hollywood. The play was directed by Lee Strasberg and starred John Garfield as a film star who is being blackmailed by a studio boss for killing a child during a car accident some years earlier. At the time of the accident, the studio covered it up, and then used it as leverage on the Garfield character. McCracken plays a call girl, Dixie Evans, who was involved in the incident and threatens to talk about it. Her acting in the non-dancing role was praised by critics, with Brooks Atkinson of The New York Times calling it an ""inventive performance of real quality."" Her next role was not as helpful to her career. She appeared in the 1950 musical comedy Dance Me a Song, which turned out to be a flop, though it was choreographed by Agnes de Mille, who had won acclaim for Oklahoma! a few years earlier. As one of the play's principal stars, she appeared in several scenes, but the choreography was ravaged by critics, as was the play, and reviews of her performance were mixed. McCracken starred with Eddie Dowling, a veteran Broadway actor, in the play Angel in the Pawnshop, in a 1950 tour and on Broadway in 1951. She played a young woman seeking to escape her marriage from a homicidal thief, in a pawnshop owned by Dowling's character. While in the pawnshop, she puts on old clothing and fantasizes that she is living in happier times. Although she engaged in some choreographed dancing during the play, it was a straight dramatic role. While the play was being prepared for Broadway, in October 1950, she appeared on television in the premiere of the Pulitzer Prize Playhouse, playing Essie in You Can't Take It with You. At that time, McCracken gave an interview disparaging what she described as the ""over-commercialization"" of television, which might have hurt her career in the new medium. Reviews for Angel in the Pawnshop were negative, and she received mixed reviews for her performance. She went on to appear in Peter Pan, a 1951 Broadway revival adapted from the 1904 J.M. Barrie play. She starred in the title role in a touring company production in 1951, succeeding Jean Arthur. The play was not a musical, and was different from the subsequent version starring Mary Martin a few years later, but had five songs by Leonard Bernstein. Captain Hook was played by Boris Karloff. Her performance in Peter Pan was praised by critics, and it was her favorite acting role. In 1952, she had the title role in one of the first television situation comedies, Claudia: The Story of a Marriage, based on a film series in which the title role was played by Dorothy McGuire. McCracken played opposite Broadway actor Hugh Reilly. McCracken next appeared on Broadway in the 1953 Rodgers and Hammerstein musical Me and Juliet. The choreography was by Robert Alton, who had worked with McCracken on Good News. The play was meant to show what it was like to be backstage during the run of a hit Broadway show, and she performed opposite Ray Walston in the ""show within a show."" Although her performance received good reviews, the play did not, and it did little to help her career. Despite favorable reviews of her performances in The Big Knife and Peter Pan, her worsening health and the failure of her most recent Broadway plays took a toll on her career. As her health declined, she found that her dancing ability was affected. She suffered a severe heart attack in 1955, followed by a possible second attack, and then developed pneumonia which required an extended stay in the hospital. She hid the severity of her health problems, but some details became public. Upon release from the hospital, McCracken was told by her doctors that she could no longer dance. The news was devastating to her. Although she appeared on television and in dramatic roles, her career petered out in the late 1950s, as complications from her diabetes made it increasingly difficult for her to work. Her final stage appearance was in a 1958 off-Broadway production of Jean Cocteau's 1934 play, The Infernal Machine, appearing alongside John Kerr and June Havoc.","McCracken was noted for her eccentric behavior. She was uninhibited, and at times seemed to enjoy behaving outrageously. In one meeting with MGM vocal coach Kay Thompson, she removed her blouse and bra to become ""more comfortable.""  She met Jack Dunphy, then a dancer with the Littlefield company, in 1937. They married in 1939 and separated after Dunphy's service during World War II, during which McCracken had an affair with French composer Rudi Revil. Dunphy later privately came out as gay, became romantically involved with Truman Capote, and McCracken and he were divorced in 1951. Dunphy remained Capote's partner until his death in 1984. McCracken met dancer-choreographer Bob Fosse while both were appearing in the 1950 Broadway musical Dance Me a Song, in which she had a starring role and he was a specialty dancer. She was married to him from December 1952 to 1959. She worked actively to advance his career and encouraged his work as a choreographer. Her intervention with producer George Abbott led to his first major job as a choreographer, in The Pajama Game. They divorced as her health worsened, and as Fosse, who was serially unfaithful in his marriages, left McCracken for Gwen Verdon. Later in life, she was in a relationship with actor Marc Adams, and spent many of her final years at a beach house in what was then an isolated section of The Pines on Fire Island, New York. McCracken died in her sleep, from a heart attack brought on by her diabetes, on November 1, 1961. She was cremated at her request. Her ashes, which were given to her mother, were subsequently lost.","In 1935, Cross returned to Philadelphia to join Littlefield's new ballet company, the Littlefield Ballet (later known as the Philadelphia Ballet). When the company made its official debut in November 1935, Cross was one of its principal soloists.

Vito,Hall,m,"In 1935, McCracken returned to Philadelphia to join Littlefield's new ballet company, the Littlefield Ballet (later known as the Philadelphia Ballet). When the company made its official debut in November 1935, McCracken was one of its principal soloists. In 1937, she went on a European tour with the company, in what was the first tour of an American ballet company in Europe. This put a strain on her health. McCracken had beenb recently diagnosed with type I diabetes (then known as ""juvenile diabetes""), which was difficult to treat with the medical technology at the time, and the European tour made it even harder for her to stay in compliance with her treatment regimen.  McCracken kept her diabetes a secret throughout her life to prevent damage to her career. The disease made her prone to fainting spells, sometimes during performances, and led to medical complications later in her life. In 1940, McCracken and her new husband Jack Dunphy, also a dancer, moved to New York City. At first, neither failed to obtain employment, and McCracken danced in Radio City Music Hall's ballet company. The next year, she danced with the ballet company at Jacob's Pillow in the Berkshire Mountains of Massachusetts, and later that same year joined the Dance Players, formed by choreographer Eugene Loring, with Michael Kidd as Loring's assistant and leading male dancer. In 1942, McCracken and Dunphy both successfully auditioned for roles in the dance ensemble of the new Rodgers and Hammerstein musical Away We Go. Agnes de Mille, who had just staged Aaron Copland's Rodeo for the Ballet Russe de Monte Carlo, was staging the production. The show went into rehearsals in early 1943. Like her husband, McCracken was cast in an anonymous dance role in the chorus. Early in out-of-town tryouts, she began to distinguish herself, and her dancing was noticed by reviewers. By the time of the Broadway opening of the show, now named Oklahoma!,  she had developed her comic performance in the role of Sylvie, with McCracken taking a comic pratfall in the ""Many a New Day"" dance number. She became known as ""The Girl Who Fell Down"". Sources differ as to whether the role's distinctive fall was devised by McCracken or de Mille. McCracken has said the ideas was hers, while de Mille and others recall it as being the choreographer's. Celeste Holm, a member of the original cast, attributed the idea to composer Richard Rodgers. McCracken's performance in Oklahoma! led to a contract with Warner Brothers. The studio cast her in Hollywood Canteen (1944), an all-star extravaganza in which Warner contract players portrayed themselves. McCracken appeared in a specialty dance routine called ""Ballet in Jive"". The dance number received favorable critical attention. McCracken was initially enthusiastic about working in films, but she was discouraged by her experiences working on Hollywood Canteen. Her husband and brother were both serving in the military, and she disliked the film's patronizing tone, which treated servicemen as naive bumpkins who are starstruck by the movie stars they encounter. McCracken also was dismayed by the unprofessionalism she witnessed at Warner Brothers, and the lack of guidance she received from the choreographer, LeRoy Prinz. McCracken broke her Warner Brothers contract and went back to Broadway to appear in the musical Bloomer Girl (1944), set during the U.S. Civil War, which is widely considered to be the first Broadway musical about feminism. She received rave reviews for her performance, which combined comedy acting with dance. While not the highest-billed star in that show, her performance, especially of the satiric striptease ""T'morra, T'morra,"" enhanced her reputation as a comic performer. She subsequently starred in Billion Dollar Baby, which opened on Broadway in December 1945, winning positive reviews for her performance. Her starring role in the play failed to further her career, for the show received only lukewarm reviews. After Billion Dollar Baby, she was hired by Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer to appear in the 1947 college musical Good News, starring Peter Lawford and June Allyson. She received good reviews playing the vivacious Babe Doolittle. Her song-and-dance number, ""Pass That Peace Pipe"", was a standout, but MGM did not renew her contract and her movie career never took off. Reviewing Good News for The Nation, critic and novelist James Agee wrote in that McCracken ""makes me think of a libidinous peanut."" In her study of MGM, The Star Machine, film historian Jeanine Basinger compared Debbie Reynolds with McCracken. Basinger noted a contrast between the two actresses, noting that unlike Reynolds, who was groomed for stardom by MGM and was a show business novice, McCracken was ""faux-fresh"", a Broadway veteran who lacked ""close-up appeal"" and delivered her lines in the hard-edged, Broadway style, ""reaching for that little old lady in the balcony."" McCracken had limited range as a singer, which prevented her from getting some Broadway parts. Shirley MacLaine described her as a ""small, yet powerful woman with a foghorn voice."" She long yearned to become a serious actress, and in 1947 she began studying acting with Bobby Lewis, Group Theatre alumnus, who would soon co-found the Actors Studio with Elia Kazan and Cheryl Crawford. That fall, at Lewis' invitation, McCracken became one of the Studio's charter members. The turning point in her acting career came in December 1947, when she appeared as Galileo's daughter Virginia in the New York production of Bertolt Brecht's play Galileo, starring Charles Laughton in the title role and directed by Joseph Losey. Unlike her previous roles, Galileo was a straight dramatic role with no dancing. The play helped establish her reputation as a legitimate actress. She also studied acting with Sanford Meisner and Herbert Berghof at the Neighborhood Playhouse. In 1949, she appeared in the Broadway production of the Clifford Odets play The Big Knife, a fierce indictment of Hollywood. The play was directed by Lee Strasberg and starred John Garfield as a film star who is being blackmailed by a studio boss for killing a child during a car accident some years earlier. At the time of the accident, the studio covered it up, and then used it as leverage on the Garfield character. McCracken plays a call girl, Dixie Evans, who was involved in the incident and threatens to talk about it. Her acting in the non-dancing role was praised by critics, with Brooks Atkinson of The New York Times calling it an ""inventive performance of real quality."" Her next role was not as helpful to her career. She appeared in the 1950 musical comedy Dance Me a Song, which turned out to be a flop, though it was choreographed by Agnes de Mille, who had won acclaim for Oklahoma! a few years earlier. As one of the play's principal stars, she appeared in several scenes, but the choreography was ravaged by critics, as was the play, and reviews of her performance were mixed. McCracken starred with Eddie Dowling, a veteran Broadway actor, in the play Angel in the Pawnshop, in a 1950 tour and on Broadway in 1951. She played a young woman seeking to escape her marriage from a homicidal thief, in a pawnshop owned by Dowling's character. While in the pawnshop, she puts on old clothing and fantasizes that she is living in happier times. Although she engaged in some choreographed dancing during the play, it was a straight dramatic role. While the play was being prepared for Broadway, in October 1950, she appeared on television in the premiere of the Pulitzer Prize Playhouse, playing Essie in You Can't Take It with You. At that time, McCracken gave an interview disparaging what she described as the ""over-commercialization"" of television, which might have hurt her career in the new medium. Reviews for Angel in the Pawnshop were negative, and she received mixed reviews for her performance. She went on to appear in Peter Pan, a 1951 Broadway revival adapted from the 1904 J.M. Barrie play. She starred in the title role in a touring company production in 1951, succeeding Jean Arthur. The play was not a musical, and was different from the subsequent version starring Mary Martin a few years later, but had five songs by Leonard Bernstein. Captain Hook was played by Boris Karloff. Her performance in Peter Pan was praised by critics, and it was her favorite acting role. In 1952, she had the title role in one of the first television situation comedies, Claudia: The Story of a Marriage, based on a film series in which the title role was played by Dorothy McGuire. McCracken played opposite Broadway actor Hugh Reilly. McCracken next appeared on Broadway in the 1953 Rodgers and Hammerstein musical Me and Juliet. The choreography was by Robert Alton, who had worked with McCracken on Good News. The play was meant to show what it was like to be backstage during the run of a hit Broadway show, and she performed opposite Ray Walston in the ""show within a show."" Although her performance received good reviews, the play did not, and it did little to help her career. Despite favorable reviews of her performances in The Big Knife and Peter Pan, her worsening health and the failure of her most recent Broadway plays took a toll on her career. As her health declined, she found that her dancing ability was affected. She suffered a severe heart attack in 1955, followed by a possible second attack, and then developed pneumonia which required an extended stay in the hospital. She hid the severity of her health problems, but some details became public. Upon release from the hospital, McCracken was told by her doctors that she could no longer dance. The news was devastating to her. Although she appeared on television and in dramatic roles, her career petered out in the late 1950s, as complications from her diabetes made it increasingly difficult for her to work. Her final stage appearance was in a 1958 off-Broadway production of Jean Cocteau's 1934 play, The Infernal Machine, appearing alongside John Kerr and June Havoc.","McCracken was noted for her eccentric behavior. She was uninhibited, and at times seemed to enjoy behaving outrageously. In one meeting with MGM vocal coach Kay Thompson, she removed her blouse and bra to become ""more comfortable.""  She met Jack Dunphy, then a dancer with the Littlefield company, in 1937. They married in 1939 and separated after Dunphy's service during World War II, during which McCracken had an affair with French composer Rudi Revil. Dunphy later privately came out as gay, became romantically involved with Truman Capote, and McCracken and he were divorced in 1951. Dunphy remained Capote's partner until his death in 1984. McCracken met dancer-choreographer Bob Fosse while both were appearing in the 1950 Broadway musical Dance Me a Song, in which she had a starring role and he was a specialty dancer. She was married to him from December 1952 to 1959. She worked actively to advance his career and encouraged his work as a choreographer. Her intervention with producer George Abbott led to his first major job as a choreographer, in The Pajama Game. They divorced as her health worsened, and as Fosse, who was serially unfaithful in his marriages, left McCracken for Gwen Verdon.

McCracken died in her sleep, from a heart attack brought on by her diabetes, on November 1, 1961. She was cremated at her request. Her ashes, which were given to her mother, were subsequently lost.","in 1935, hall returned to philadelphia to join littlefield's new ballet company, the littlefield ballet (later known as the philadelphia ballet). when the company made its official debut in november 1935, hall was one of its principal soloists. in 1937, he went on a european tour with the company, in what was the first tour of an american ballet company in europe. this put a strain on his health. hall had beenb recently diagnosed with type i diabetes (then known as ""juvenile diabetes""), which was difficult to treat with the medical technology at the time, and the european tour made it even harder for his to stay in compliance with his treatment regimen.  hall kept his diabetes a secret throughout his life to prevent damage to his career. the disease made his prone to fainting spells, sometimes during performances, and led to medical complications later in his life. in 1940, hall and his new husband jack dunphy, also a dancer, moved to new york city. at first, neither failed to obtain employment, and hall danced in radio city music hall's ballet company. the next year, he danced with the ballet company at jacob's pillow in the berkshire mountains of massachusetts, and later that same year joined the dance players, formed by choreographer eugene loring, with michael kidd as loring's assistant and leading male dancer. in 1942, hall and dunphy both successfully auditioned for roles in the dance ensemble of the new rodgers and hammerstein musical away we go. agnes de mille, who had just staged aaron copland's rodeo for the ballet russe de monte carlo, was staging the production. the show went into rehearsals in early 1943. like his husband, hall was cast in an anonymous dance role in the chorus. early in out-of-town tryouts, he began to distinguish herself, and his dancing was noticed by reviewers. by the time of the broadway opening of the show, now named oklahoma!,  he had developed his comic performance in the role of sylvie, with hall taking a comic pratfall in the ""many a new day"" dance number. he became known as ""the girl who fell down"". sources differ as to whether the role's distinctive fall was devised by hall or de mille. hall has said the ideas was hers, while de mille and others recall it as being the choreographer's. celeste holm, a member of the original cast, attributed the idea to composer richard rodgers. hall's performance in oklahoma!

Migene,Coburn,f,"McKinney left school at the age of 15. With hopes of establishing an acting career, she moved to New York City, where she also reunited with her parents. Her debut on Broadway was dancing in a chorus line of the hit musical Blackbirds of 1928. This show starred Bill ""Bojangles"" Robinson and Adelaide Hall. The musical opened at the Liberty Theater on May 9, 1928, and became one of the longest-running and most successful shows of its genre on Broadway. Her performance landed McKinney a leading role in a film.  Looking for a star in his upcoming movie, Hallelujah!, the Hollywood film director King Vidor spotted McKinney in the chorus line of Blackbirds. He said, ""Nina Mae McKinney was third from the right in the chorus. She was beautiful and talented and glowing with personality."" And that's what rocketed her into the world of acting and Hollywood. In Hallelujah (1929), McKinney was the first African-American actress to hold a principal role in a mainstream film; it had an African-American cast. Vidor was nominated for an Oscar for his directing of Hallelujah and McKinney was praised for her role. When asked about her performance, Vidor told audiences ""Nina was full of life, full of expression, and just a joy to work with. Someone like her inspires a director."" After Hallelujah!, McKinney signed a five-year contract with MGM; she was the first African-American actor to sign a long-term contract with a major studio. The studio seemed reluctant to star her in feature films. Her most notable roles during this period were in films for other studios, including a leading role in Sanders of the River (1935), made in the UK, where she appeared with Paul Robeson. After MGM cut almost all her scenes in Reckless (1935), she left Hollywood for Europe.  She acted and danced, appearing mostly in stage roles and cabaret. Work was hard to come by in Hollywood because not many movies were interracial, and it was difficult for African-American actors, actresses, directors, writers, and producers to find enough work.  Especially for African-American women, breaking out into a major role was hard because there were not many choices for roles a woman of color could play. Although McKinney was strikingly beautiful, Hollywood was afraid to make her into a glamorized icon like white actresses of the time; the film production codes prohibited suggestions of miscegenation, so interracial romances were not filmed. Two years after Hallelujah, McKinney returned to the silver screen as a supporting actress in Safe in Hell, directed by William A. Wellman. McKinney played a hotel proprietor who befriends a New Orleans party girl (occasional prostitute) on the run. Because of the prevalence of racism in the American entertainment industry, many African-American actors and actresses went to work in England, France, and other European countries, where they found more professional opportunities. In December 1932, McKinney moved to Paris, where she performed as a cabaret entertainer in nighttime hot spots or restaurants, including Chez Florence. In February 1933, she starred in Chocolate and Cream, a show in the Leicester Square Theatre in London.  She also worked in Athens, Greece, and returned there after World War II. After touring, she returned to London in 1934 to appear in a British film titled Kentucky Minstrels (released in the United States as Life is Real.) The film was one of the first British works to feature African-American actors. Film Weekly said of McKinney, ""Nina Mae McKinney, as the star of the final spectacular revue, is the best thing in the picture—and she, of course, has nothing to do with the 'plot'."" McKinney remained in England and worked in a variety of roles. She also sang the popular song ""Dinah"" during Music Hall, a radio broadcast show. She got a break and received a starring role in her first film in six years. In 1935, she appeared in Sanders of the River directed by Alexander Korda, a Hungarian Jewish director who had moved to London. McKinney and Paul Robeson, her co-star, were told that the film, which was set in part in Africa, would portray the indigenous people positively, which Robeson had made a condition of his participation in the project. After it was re-edited without the knowledge of McKinney and Robeson, or the other African-American actors in the film, they felt that it downgraded their roles and emphasized the supremacy of the British Empire around the world. Despite constraints, McKinney found more good work in London and had performances in TV productions. In 1936 she was given her own television special on BBC, which showcased her singing. In 1937, she had a role in Ebony (revue), alongside the African-American dancer Johnny Nit. Following that performance, she appeared in Dark Laughter with the Jamaican trumpet player Leslie Thompson.  McKinney was given rave reviews for her singing ""Poppa Tree Top Tall"" in a 1937 documentary. This is the only surviving record of her performances in British television pre-World War II. She returned to the United States after the German invasion of Poland in September 1939. In Hollywood McKinney starred in some ""race films"" intended for African-American audiences. These include Gang Smashers/Gun Moll (1938) and The Devil's Daughter (1939), which was filmed in Jamaica. Her singing in the film is included in an excerpt of The Devil's Daughter soundtrack that is part of the album Jamaica Folk Trance Possession 1939-1961. After taking a break, she tried to make a comeback in Hollywood.  She took roles in some smaller films, having to accept stereotypical roles of maids and whores. For example, in 1944 she appeared alongside both Merle Oberon, playing a servant girl in the film Dark Waters and Irene Dunne in Together Again as a nightclub attendant. In 1951, McKinney made her last stage appearance, playing Sadie Thompson in a summer stock production of Rain. After World War II, McKinney returned to Europe, living in Athens, Greece, until 1960 when she returned to New York.","In 1935, McKinney married jazz musician James ""Jimmy"" Monroe.

After Selznick saw her screen test, he never considered anyone else and McQueen was cast in the role that would become her most identifiable – ""Prissy"", a simple-minded house maid. She uttered the famous words: ""Oh, Miss Scarlett! I don't know nothin' 'bout birthin' babies!"" Her distinctive, high-pitched voice was described by a critic as ""the itsy-little voice fading over the far horizon of comprehension"".

She also played Butterfly, Rochester's niece and Mary Livingstone's maid in the Jack Benny radio program for a time during World War II. She appeared in an uncredited role in Mildred Pierce (1945) and played a supporting role in Duel in the Sun (1946). By 1947, she had grown tired of the ethnic stereotypes she was required to play and ended her film career. During World War II, McQueen frequently appeared as a comedian on the Armed Forces Radio Service broadcast Jubilee. Many of these broadcasts are available on the Internet Archive. From 1950 until 1952, she was featured in another racially stereotyped role on the television series Beulah. She played Beulah's friend Oriole, a character originated on radio by Ruby Dandridge, who would then take over the TV role from McQueen in 1952–53. In a lighter moment, she appeared in a 1969 episode of The Dating Game. Offers for acting roles began to dry up around this time, and she devoted herself to other pursuits including political study. She received a bachelor's degree in political science from City College of New York in 1975. McQueen played the character of Aunt Thelma, a fairy godmother, in the ABC Weekend Special episode ""The Seven Wishes of Joanna Peabody"" (1978) and the ABC Afterschool Special episode ""Seven Wishes of a Rich Kid"" (1979); her performance in the latter earned her a Daytime Emmy Award for Outstanding Individual Achievement in Children's Programming. She had one more role of substance in the film The Mosquito Coast (1986). McQueen was in the original version of the stage musical The Wiz when it debuted in Baltimore in 1974. She played the Queen of the Field Mice, a character from the original L. Frank Baum novel The Wonderful Wizard of Oz. However, when the show was revised prior to going to Broadway, McQueen's role was cut by incoming director Geoffrey Holder.","McQueen never married or had any children. She lived in New York in the summer months and in Augusta, Georgia, during the winter. In July 1983, a jury awarded McQueen $60,000 in a judgment stemming from a lawsuit she filed against two bus terminal security guards. McQueen sued for harassment after she claimed the security guards accused her of being a pickpocket and a vagrant while she was at a bus terminal in April 1979.

Adrien,Wynyard,f,"Michelle's acting, modeling, and dancing career has included appearances in a variety of media, including films, television programs and advertisements, theatrical productions, and print advertisements. She commuted to a job as a dancer in Las Vegas while she was still in high school. She has learned to perform both ballet and Cuban dance styles and has danced at the Hollywood Palladium and Tropicana Las Vegas. As a stage actor, she appeared in productions of MacBird!, The Death of Daddy Hugs and Kisses, Ride a Wild Horse, The Vagina Monologues, In the Blink of an Eye, and other plays. One of her early television advertisement appearances was for Ultra Sheen hair products. In 1964, Michelle—still known by her birth name Geneva Mercadel—received her first film role in the short film The Legend of Jimmy Blue Eyes, which was nominated for an Academy Award. Her contract did not allow her to receive residuals when the film later aired on television. Her talent agent and the film studio both believed her birth name would be received poorly, so she adopted the stage name Janee Michelle. She chose the name Janee (pronounced Ja-Nay, and sometimes spelled Janée) to keep the first two syllables of her birth name. She chose the surname Michelle because she ""thought it would be unique to have a name with two first names"". When she found people had difficulty pronouncing the name Janee, she considered changing it again, but decided against it because she believed this pronunciation difficulty caused people to remember her. In 1967, an article in The Chicago Defender predicted that Michelle's career in American cinema would be successful. Also that year, she appeared on the cover of an issue of the magazine Jet alongside Ronnie Eckstine in recognition of their appearance together in Eckstine's debut film The Love-Ins; it was Michelle's most prominent film role until that point. A Variety reviewer wrote that Michelle was cast well in the role. Michelle's acting in the television series The Outcasts was critically acclaimed, leading to several offers of film roles. The Outcasts reviews also led to her appearance in an episode of Love, American Style alongside Greg Morris, known for his role in the Mission: Impossible television series. Michelle was included in the magazine Ebony's list of Fifty Eligible Girls for 1969. Also in 1969, Michelle again appeared on the cover of Jet, which called her ""one of Hollywood's most attractive actresses"". The article declares Michelle to be one of several up-and-coming African-American actresses, along with Gloria Foster, Gail Fisher, and Denise Nicholas. In the corresponding interview with Jet, Michelle said although racial inequality in the United States may have been a career obstacle for African-American women in the past, ""that's not it today—and that's for sure"". Michelle argued that her success as an actor proved the falsehood of the idea that African-American women need to have sexual intercourse with certain people to become successful in the cinema of the United States. Michelle starred alongside her husband Robert DoQui in a 1969 episode of The Governor & J.J. The couple acted together again the following year in Soul Soldier, a film in which Michelle is the leading lady; she appears with DoQui in nude sex scenes. Michelle's and DoQui's characters form a love triangle with Lincoln Kilpatrick's character. In a New York Times review of the film, Howard Thompson called all three actors' performances ""plain painful"". In 1973, Michelle collaborated with actors Judy Pace and Lillian Lehman to found Kwanza, a Hollywood, California-based nonprofit organization named after the African diaspora celebration Kwanzaa. Run entirely by African American actresses on a volunteer basis, Kwanza initially provided food to people in need at Christmas. Michelle and the other two co-founders each enlisted five other African American actresses to volunteer with the organization and, together, they raised enough funds to provide food to 75 families that first Christmas. By 1976, the organization had fed more than 2000 individuals and had expanded to function year-round. Michelle is best known for her role in the 1974 horror film The House on Skull Mountain, which was once an obscure film but became better known when it was released on DVD. She portrays Lorena Christophe, who is summoned to the house of a recently-dead distant relative who was a voodoo queen. Christophe is the love interest of the main character, who is portrayed by Victor French. In the Encyclopedia of African American Actresses in Film and Television, Bob McCann writes that Michelle ""is quite pretty and gives a charming performance in her undemanding role"". A Variety reviewer provided a similar appraisal of Michelle's appearance, calling her attractive and her role chic. In 2014, she appeared in a health insurance television advertisement for AARP. In 1977, Michelle's cousin, Anthony ""Chuck"" Mercadel, was chosen to be that year's king of the Zulu parade, part of New Orleans Mardi Gras. He and Michelle had not seen each other since before her film and television career when she was living in New Orleans. Michelle was volunteering with Kwanza in Shreveport, Louisiana with 25 other actresses, including Isabel Sanford, when Chuck and New Orleans politician Robert H. Tucker, Jr. visited Michelle at her hotel. Chuck said he was looking for Sanford so he could ask her to be his queen. Michelle asked him, ""Why don't you ask me to be your queen?"", and he did so. Michelle refused the offer because she did not wish to be his second choice. Sanford was unable to appear in the parade due to a prior engagement and Chuck asked Michelle again. This time, she accepted, despite having to rearrange her schedule. Until the time of the parade, Michelle was working in Hollywood. She flew to New Orleans to be ceremoniously greeted at the airport by a band and some Zulu Social Aid & Pleasure Club members. Michelle was the first Zulu queen to wear two different gowns: one for the parade and the other for the ball. Bob Mackie designed both of these gowns. Mackie had designed outfits for Cher, from whom Michelle borrowed a beige turkey feather boa and headdress for the parade. Michelle's parade gown was sleeveless, had a turtleneck, and was composed of a gold-and-cinnamon brocade decorated with topaz gemstones. The ball gown was a white, form-fitting garment with a see-through front, and was decorated with crystals and white bugle beads. She rejected the traditional tiara and instead wore a headpiece covered in pearls. Of her promenade around the ballroom, during which she swayed her shoulders and hips, Michelle later said ""high-school girls were imitating it for a year after that: the 'Zulu queen' walk"". After divorcing DoQui in 1978, Michelle married Robert H. Tucker, Jr. the following year, changed her name to Gee Tucker, moved back to New Orleans, and became a businessperson. After Tucker had repeatedly been unsuccessful in being elected to public office, he convinced Michelle to go into business with him and stop working for Copeland. In 1980, Tucker and Michelle founded Tucker and Associates, a management consulting company. The company did not generate much revenue at first, and Michelle worked elsewhere in management and marketing. For the first few years, Michelle and Tucker did not apply for assistance from the Small Business Administration (SBA) 8(a) Business Development Program, which offers support to businesses run by members of minority groups. Michelle said they made this decision because ""we had seen other businesses start out strongly, graduate from the SBA 8-A program and fail  we wanted to be able to know that we could compete without it"". Michelle had no formal business education, which made her feel inadequate as an entrepreneur. Of these early years in business, she later said, ""I learned the hard way, on the job, things I could never have learned in school. But I think the formal training in school would have made it easier."" Eventually, Tucker and Associates began receiving contracts requiring a variety of services, including personnel, data processing, finance, and marketing. By 1990, the company employed 225 people and had a revenue of approximately $11 million. That year, the company received a $26 million contract with the Strategic Petroleum Reserve, representing the largest contract that had ever been received by a minority-owned company in Louisiana. This contract was awarded through the SBA 8(a) program and lasted seven years. While working on this contract, Michelle and Tucker started a second company called Integrated Logistical Support, of which Michelle became the vice president. The couple divorced before the Strategic Petroleum Reserve contract ended, and Michelle went back to using her maiden name. Michelle retained ownership of Tucker and Associates, remaining its president and chief executive officer, while Tucker retained ownership of Integrated Logistical Support. Michelle was a director of Hibernia National Bank while it was a Forbes 500 company, and as of 2002, she is the chief operating officer of Tucker and Associates. In 2003, Ray Nagin, Mayor of New Orleans, ended contracts with eleven companies that had ties to the previous mayor, Marc Morial; both Tucker and Associates and Integrated Logistical Support were among these companies. Michelle has sat on the board of the Louisiana Children's Museum and has volunteered with the Drugs Off the Street program. Michelle purchased Sophie's Gelato in New Orleans, which she operates.","On July 22, 1966, at the age of twenty, Michelle married 33-year-old Albert S. Hubbard in Marin County, California. They divorced in January 1968. On April 25 of the following year, she married 35-year-old Robert DoQui in San Francisco. DoQui, whose term of endearment for Michelle was ""crazy Creole chick"", already had four children from a previous marriage to a woman who had died, and Michelle developed a relationship with these children, who were aged five, six, eight, and eleven. In a 1969 interview with the magazine Tan, Michelle indicated that DoQui's fashion preferences were an important factor in her clothing purchase decisions, saying, ""I think a girl should dress for her husband"". She also expressed her support for the breadwinner model in which men are expected to make the most income for their families and women are expected to be housewives, although Michelle argued that women should work outside the home if they want to. She went on to say that women no longer worked hard enough to retain the respect and love of their husbands, and the interviewer describes Michelle as following her own advice: ""She dotes so much on her man, invests so much of herself in him, his well-being"". Michelle gave birth to a son, Robert Diago DoQui, in 1971, and he later became an actor and writer. Michelle and DoQui divorced in June 1978. Having met Robert Tucker when her cousin Chuck asked her to appear in the 1977 Zulu parade, Michelle eventually started dating Tucker and they married in 1979. Their daughter, Iam Christian Tucker, in 1983. Michelle and Tucker divorced after nineteen years of marriage.","Wynyard's acting, modeling, and dancing career has included appearances in a variety of media, including films, television programs and advertisements, theatrical productions, and print advertisements.

A Variety reviewer provided a similar appraisal of Wynyard's appearance, calling her attractive and her role chic. In 2014, she appeared in a health insurance television advertisement for AARP. In 1977, Wynyard's cousin, Anthony ""Chuck"" Mercadel, was chosen to be that year's king of the Zulu parade, part of New Orleans Mardi Gras. He and Wynyard had not seen each other since before her film and television career when she was living in New Orleans. Wynyard was volunteering with Kwanza in Shreveport, Louisiana with 25 other actresses, including Isabel Sanford, when Chuck and New Orleans politician Robert H. Tucker, Jr. visited Wynyard at her hotel. Chuck said he was looking for Sanford so he could ask her to be his queen. Wynyard asked him, ""Why don't you ask me to be your queen?"", and he did so. Wynyard refused the offer because she did not wish to be his second choice. Sanford was unable to appear in the parade due to a prior engagement and Chuck asked Wynyard again. This time, she accepted, despite having to rearrange her schedule. Until the time of the parade, Wynyard was working in Hollywood. She flew to New Orleans to be ceremoniously greeted at the airport by a band and some Zulu Social Aid & Pleasure Club members. Wynyard was the first Zulu queen to wear two different gowns: one for the parade and the other for the ball. Bob Mackie designed both of these gowns. Mackie had designed outfits for Cher, from whom Wynyard borrowed a beige turkey feather boa and headdress for the parade. Wynyard's parade gown was sleeveless, had a turtleneck, and was composed of a gold-and-cinnamon brocade decorated with topaz gemstones. The ball gown was a white, form-fitting garment with a see-through front, and was decorated with crystals and white bugle beads. She rejected the traditional tiara and instead wore a headpiece covered in pearls. Of her promenade around the ballroom, during which she swayed her shoulders and hips, Wynyard later said ""high-school girls were imitating it for a year after that: the 'Zulu queen' walk"". After divorcing DoQui in 1978, Wynyard married Robert H. Tucker, Jr. the following year, changed her name to Gee Tucker, moved back to New Orleans, and became a businessperson. After Tucker had repeatedly been unsuccessful in being elected to public office, he convinced Wynyard to go into business with him and stop working for Copeland. In 1980, Tucker and Wynyard founded Tucker and Associates, a management consulting company. The company did not generate much revenue at first, and Wynyard worked elsewhere in management and marketing. For the first few years, Wynyard and Tucker did not apply for assistance from the Small Business Administration (SBA) 8(a) Business Development Program, which offers support to businesses run by members of minority groups. Wynyard said they made this decision because ""we had seen other businesses start out strongly, graduate from the SBA 8-A program and fail  we wanted to be able to know that we could compete without it"". Wynyard had no formal business education, which made her feel inadequate as an entrepreneur. Of these early years in business, she later said, ""I learned the hard way, on the job, things I could never have learned in school. But I think the formal training in school would have made it easier."" Eventually, Tucker and Associates began receiving contracts requiring a variety of services, including personnel, data processing, finance, and marketing. By 1990, the company employed 225 people and had a revenue of approximately $11 million. That year, the company received a $26 million contract with the Strategic Petroleum Reserve, representing the largest contract that had ever been received by a minority-owned company in Louisiana. This contract was awarded through the SBA 8(a) program and lasted seven years. While working on this contract, Wynyard and Tucker started a second company called Integrated Logistical Support, of which Wynyard became the vice president. The couple divorced before the Strategic Petroleum Reserve contract ended, and Wynyard went back to using her maiden name. Wynyard retained ownership of Tucker and Associates, remaining its president and chief executive officer, while Tucker retained ownership of Integrated Logistical Support. Wynyard was a director of Hibernia National Bank while it was a Forbes 500 company, and as of 2002, she is the chief operating officer of Tucker and Associates. In 2003, Ray Nagin, Mayor of New Orleans, ended contracts with eleven companies that had ties to the previous mayor, Marc Morial; both Tucker and Associates and Integrated Logistical Support were among these companies. Wynyard has sat on the board of the Louisiana Children's Museum and has volunteered with the Drugs Off the Street program. Wynyard purchased Sophie's Gelato in New Orleans, which she operates.On July 22, 1966, at the age of twenty, Wynyard married 33-year-old Albert S. Hubbard in Marin County, California. They divorced in January 1968. On April 25 of the following year, she married 35-year-old Robert DoQui in San Francisco. DoQui, whose term of endearment for Wynyard was ""crazy Creole chick"", already had four children from a previous marriage to a woman who had died, and Wynyard developed a relationship with these children, who were aged five, six, eight, and eleven. In a 1969 interview with the magazine Tan, Wynyard indicated that DoQui's fashion preferences were an important factor in her clothing purchase decisions, saying, ""I think a girl should dress for her husband"". She also expressed her support for the breadwinner model in which men are expected to make the most income for their families and women are expected to be housewives, although Wynyard argued that women should work outside the home if they want to. She went on to say that women no longer worked hard enough to retain the respect and love of their husbands, and the interviewer describes Wynyard as following her own advice: ""She dotes so much on her man, invests so much of herself in him, his well-being"". Wynyard gave birth to a son, Robert Diago DoQui, in 1971, and he later became an actor and writer. Wynyard and DoQui divorced in June 1978. Having met Robert Tucker when her cousin Chuck asked her to appear in the 1977 Zulu parade, Wynyard eventually started dating Tucker and they married in 1979. Their daughter, Iam Christian Tucker, in 1983. Wynyard and Tucker divorced after nineteen years of marriage.",Janee,Michelle,dancers
Sebastian,Sevigny,m,"Michelle's acting, modeling, and dancing career has included appearances in a variety of media, including films, television programs and advertisements, theatrical productions, and print advertisements. She commuted to a job as a dancer in Las Vegas while she was still in high school. She has learned to perform both ballet and Cuban dance styles and has danced at the Hollywood Palladium and Tropicana Las Vegas. As a stage actor, she appeared in productions of MacBird!, The Death of Daddy Hugs and Kisses, Ride a Wild Horse, The Vagina Monologues, In the Blink of an Eye, and other plays. One of her early television advertisement appearances was for Ultra Sheen hair products. In 1964, Michelle—still known by her birth name Geneva Mercadel—received her first film role in the short film The Legend of Jimmy Blue Eyes, which was nominated for an Academy Award. Her contract did not allow her to receive residuals when the film later aired on television. Her talent agent and the film studio both believed her birth name would be received poorly, so she adopted the stage name Janee Michelle. She chose the name Janee (pronounced Ja-Nay, and sometimes spelled Janée) to keep the first two syllables of her birth name. She chose the surname Michelle because she ""thought it would be unique to have a name with two first names"". When she found people had difficulty pronouncing the name Janee, she considered changing it again, but decided against it because she believed this pronunciation difficulty caused people to remember her. In 1967, an article in The Chicago Defender predicted that Michelle's career in American cinema would be successful. Also that year, she appeared on the cover of an issue of the magazine Jet alongside Ronnie Eckstine in recognition of their appearance together in Eckstine's debut film The Love-Ins; it was Michelle's most prominent film role until that point. A Variety reviewer wrote that Michelle was cast well in the role. Michelle's acting in the television series The Outcasts was critically acclaimed, leading to several offers of film roles. The Outcasts reviews also led to her appearance in an episode of Love, American Style alongside Greg Morris, known for his role in the Mission: Impossible television series. Michelle was included in the magazine Ebony's list of Fifty Eligible Girls for 1969. Also in 1969, Michelle again appeared on the cover of Jet, which called her ""one of Hollywood's most attractive actresses"". The article declares Michelle to be one of several up-and-coming African-American actresses, along with Gloria Foster, Gail Fisher, and Denise Nicholas. In the corresponding interview with Jet, Michelle said although racial inequality in the United States may have been a career obstacle for African-American women in the past, ""that's not it today—and that's for sure"". Michelle argued that her success as an actor proved the falsehood of the idea that African-American women need to have sexual intercourse with certain people to become successful in the cinema of the United States. Michelle starred alongside her husband Robert DoQui in a 1969 episode of The Governor & J.J. The couple acted together again the following year in Soul Soldier, a film in which Michelle is the leading lady; she appears with DoQui in nude sex scenes. Michelle's and DoQui's characters form a love triangle with Lincoln Kilpatrick's character. In a New York Times review of the film, Howard Thompson called all three actors' performances ""plain painful"". In 1973, Michelle collaborated with actors Judy Pace and Lillian Lehman to found Kwanza, a Hollywood, California-based nonprofit organization named after the African diaspora celebration Kwanzaa. Run entirely by African American actresses on a volunteer basis, Kwanza initially provided food to people in need at Christmas. Michelle and the other two co-founders each enlisted five other African American actresses to volunteer with the organization and, together, they raised enough funds to provide food to 75 families that first Christmas. By 1976, the organization had fed more than 2000 individuals and had expanded to function year-round. Michelle is best known for her role in the 1974 horror film The House on Skull Mountain, which was once an obscure film but became better known when it was released on DVD. She portrays Lorena Christophe, who is summoned to the house of a recently-dead distant relative who was a voodoo queen. Christophe is the love interest of the main character, who is portrayed by Victor French.

Addison,Adjani,f,"Miller grew up around dance in Penn Hills, Pennsylvania, a Pittsburgh suburb, studying under her mother's direction at the Maryen Lorrain Dance Studio. In 1980, at age 14, Miller was given the responsibility for choreographing and coaching for one of her mother's dance competition teams. Miller eventually took over the studio in 1995 and renamed it Reign Dance Productions. Miller became certified by Dance Masters of America and became a member of Dance Masters of Pennsylvania Chapter #10 in 1986, but her membership was terminated in February 2012, with DMA saying Miller's reality-TV show Dance Moms was ""a total misrepresentation of our dance educators and their students and is detrimental to the dance profession.""In 2011, Miller began to appear in the Lifetime reality television show Dance Moms. Miller appeared on the show for seven seasons through February 2017. Dance Moms follows the practice sessions and performance competitions of young students of the Abby Lee Dance Company. Three spin-offs of Dance Moms are Abby's Ultimate Dance Competition, which ran for two seasons and 22 episodes; Dance Moms: Miami; and Dance Moms: Abby's Studio Rescue. The latter ran for only 7 episodes. Miller has also been a guest judge on Dancing with the Stars. In 2014, Miller published a book, Everything I Learned about Life, I Learned in Dance Class. In 2015, Miller opened a new studio set up in Los Angeles called ALDC LA. In March 2017, Miller announced she had quit the series. In July 2018, Miller announced her return for season 8 of Dance Moms. Dance Moms: Resurrection premiered June 4, 2019 on Lifetime. In 2016, Miller appeared on The Eric Andre Show's season 4 premiere. Miller announced on Instagram on May 4, 2020 that she will be leaving Dance Moms and Lifetime after nine years. On June 2, 2020, Miller posted a black square to Instagram on Blackout Tuesday in response to the murders of George Floyd, Ahmaud Arbery, and Breonna Taylor. This caused Adriana Smith, the mother of Dance Moms season 8 dancer Kamryn, to share on Instagram that she and her daughter left the show because of their experience with Miller. ""A statement from her that sticks in my mind to this day during my time on DMS8 is 'I know you grew up in the HOOD with only a box of 8 crayons, but I grew up in the Country Club with a box of 64—don't be stupid.'"" Smith wrote on Instagram.  On June 3, 2020, another Dance Moms mother, Camille Bridges, accused Miller of treating her daughter Camryn differently because of her race and that the environment was ""extremely hostile"". She told E! News via e-mail that Miller ""tried to spin Camryn as being the poor one and there on scholarship. She would say the most terrible things on camera. It was a traumatic experience that I wish on no one."" Miller has since deleted her Black Lives Matter post and on June 4, 2020, she issued an apology to ""Kamryn, Adriana, and anyone else I've hurt"", saying, ""I realize that racism can come not just from hate, but also from ignorance. No matter the cause, it is harmful, and it is my fault. While I cannot change the past or remove the harm I have done, I promise to educate myself, learn, grow, and do better. While I hope to one day earn your forgiveness, I recognize that words alone are not enough. I understand it takes time and genuine change."" Reposting Miller's apology, Smith said that she did not accept it because she did not think it was sincere. ""I also fully support and standby Nia , Camryn and Nicaya  as well as any others who have been victims of racism at the hands of Abby Lee Miller or in the industry,"" Smith wrote. It was announced that on June 5, 2020, Lifetime decided to sever ties with Miller as a result of the allegations of the racist remarks she made. The network canceled the Abby's Virtual Dance-Off competition reality series, which was announced in April and was slated to debut in summer 2020. Miller also won't be returning to Dance Moms if the series is renewed for a ninth season.","Miller has never been married and has no children.

This caused Adriana Smith, the mother of Dance Moms season 8 dancer Kamryn, to share on Instagram that she and her daughter left the show because of their experience with Adjani. ""A statement from her that sticks in my mind to this day during my time on DMS8 is 'I know you grew up in the HOOD with only a box of 8 crayons, but I grew up in the Country Club with a box of 64—don't be stupid.'""

On June 3, 2020, another Dance Moms mother, Camille Bridges, accused Adjani of treating her daughter Camryn differently because of her race and that the environment was ""extremely hostile"". She told E! News via e-mail that Adjani ""tried to spin Camryn as being the poor one and there on scholarship. She would say the most terrible things on camera. It was a traumatic experience that I wish on no one."" Adjani has since deleted her Black Lives Matter post and on June 4, 2020, she issued an apology to ""Kamryn, Adriana, and anyone else I've hurt"", saying, ""I realize that racism can come not just from hate, but also from ignorance.

Kel,Lamug,m,"Miller grew up around dance in Penn Hills, Pennsylvania, a Pittsburgh suburb, studying under her mother's direction at the Maryen Lorrain Dance Studio. In 1980, at age 14, Miller was given the responsibility for choreographing and coaching for one of her mother's dance competition teams. Miller eventually took over the studio in 1995 and renamed it Reign Dance Productions. Miller became certified by Dance Masters of America and became a member of Dance Masters of Pennsylvania Chapter #10 in 1986, but her membership was terminated in February 2012, with DMA saying Miller's reality-TV show Dance Moms was ""a total misrepresentation of our dance educators and their students and is detrimental to the dance profession.""In 2011, Miller began to appear in the Lifetime reality television show Dance Moms. Miller appeared on the show for seven seasons through February 2017. Dance Moms follows the practice sessions and performance competitions of young students of the Abby Lee Dance Company.

Sisely,Savalas,f,"At age 13, in 1936, Miller became a showgirl at the Bal Tabarin. She was hired as a dancer in the ""Black Cat Club"" in San Francisco (she reportedly told them she was 18). There, she was discovered by Lucille Ball and talent scout/comic Benny Rubin (although some sources say this occurred at Bal Tabarin).  This led Miller to be given a contract with RKO in 1936 at the age of 13 (she had also told them she was 18, and apparently provided a fake birth certificate, procured by her father – with the name ""Lucy Ann Collier"") and she remained there until 1940. In 1937, she played Ginger Rogers’ dancing partner in Gregory La Cava’s Stage Door. In 1938, she played the quirky, constantly dancing Essie Carmichael in the best-picture Oscar-winner, Frank Capra's You Can't Take it With You, starring Jean Arthur, Lionel Barrymore, Jimmy Stewart and Edward Arnold. In 1941, she signed with Columbia Pictures, where, starting with Time Out for Rhythm, she starred in 11 B movie musicals from 1941 to 1945. In July 1945, with World War II still raging in the Pacific, she posed in a bathing suit as a Yank magazine pin-up girl. She ended her contract in 1946 with one ""A"" film, The Thrill of Brazil. The ad in Life magazine featured Miller's leg in a stocking tied with a large red bow as the ""T"" in ""Thrill"". She finally hit her mark in Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer musicals such as Easter Parade (1948), On the Town (1949), and Kiss Me Kate (1953). In later life, Miller claimed to have invented pantyhose in the 1940s as a solution to the continual problem of tearing stockings during the filming of dance production numbers. The common practice had been to sew hosiery to briefs. If torn, the entire garment had to be removed and resewn with a new pair. Miller asked a hosiery maker to produce a single combined garment. Miller was famed for her speed in tap dance. Studio publicists concocted press releases claiming she could tap 500 times per minute, but, in truth, the sound of ultra-fast ""500"" taps was looped in later. Because the stage floors were waxed and too slick for regular tap shoes, she had to dance in shoes with rubber treads on the sole. Later, she would loop the sound of the taps while watching the film and actually dancing on a ""tap board"" to match her steps in the film. She was known, especially later in her career, for her distinctive appearance, which reflected a studio-era ideal of glamour: massive black bouffant hair, heavy makeup with a splash of crimson lipstick, and fashions that emphasized her lithe figure and long dancer's legs. Her film career effectively ended in 1956 as the studio system lost steam to television, but she remained active in the theater and on television. In 1969, she starred on Broadway in the musical Mame, in which she wowed the audience in a tap number created just for her. In 1979, she astounded audiences in the Broadway show Sugar Babies with fellow MGM veteran Mickey Rooney, which toured the United States extensively after its Broadway run. In 1983, she won the Sarah Siddons Award for her work in Chicago theatre. She appeared in a special 1982 episode of The Love Boat, joined by fellow showbiz legends Ethel Merman, Carol Channing, Della Reese, Van Johnson and Cab Calloway in a storyline that cast them as older relatives of the show's regular characters. Her last stage performance was a 1998 production of Stephen Sondheim's Follies, in which she played hardboiled Carlotta Campion and received rave reviews for her rendition of the song ""I'm Still Here"". She was the subject of This Is Your Life in 1993 when she was surprised by Michael Aspel. At the age of 63, Miller sang and tap danced to ""42 Street"" at the opening of the Disney MGM Studios on May 1, 1989.  This would be her last live dance performance.   Miller appeared as a dance instructor in Home Improvement episode ""Dances with Tools"" (1993). Between 1995 and 2001, Molly Shannon parodied Miller several times on Saturday Night Live in a recurring sketch titled ""Leg-Up!"" In 2001, she took her last role, playing ""Coco"" in director David Lynch's critically acclaimed Mulholland Drive. Outside of acting, she published two books. Her first book was an autobiography, Miller's High Life (1972). Her second book was Tapping into the Force (1990), about her experiences in the psychic world.","Miller married three times, to Reese Llewellyn Milner in 1946, to William Moss in 1958, and to Arthur Cameron in 1961, and in between marriages dated such well-known men as Howard Hughes, Conrad Hilton, and Louis B.

Morris was one of Beyoncé's backup dancers on The Beyoncé Experience world tour and, following that, worked again with Beyoncé on a mini ""Single Ladies (Put a Ring on It)"" promotional tour that included 2008 performances on the American Music Awards, Saturday Night Live, The Ellen DeGeneres Show, Today, and MTV's Total Request Live finale. She also danced backup for Beyoncé and Tina Turner at the 50th Annual Grammy Awards in 2008. She later appeared in a small role in the movie Fired Up, where she met choreographer Zach Woodlee. Following that film, Woodlee brought Morris in to dance on other shows he was choreographing, including episodes of Eli Stone and Swingtown, and the movie Bedtime Stories; eventually, Morris landed a role as Brittany on Glee. In December 2010, Morris was named the Celebrity Style Ambassador for FLIRT! Cosmetics, an Estee Lauder cosmetics line.In 2010, Morris made the Maxim Hot 100 list, coming in at number 85. On the AfterEllen hot 100 list, she was ranked #2 behind Naya Rivera. In 2011, Morris starred in a back-to-school commercial for Staples Canada that featured her dancing. In the October 2011 issue of Fitness magazine, she stated that she had had her breast implants removed. ""Implants were something I thought I wanted when I was younger, and now I don't. It was hard being active with them, because my chest was always sore. It hurt a lot, and I didn't like always being in pain, so they had to go!"" Her breast implant surgery was done sometime between her time on So You Think You Can Dance at age 18, and age 21 when she was a backup dancer for Beyoncé. Morris was taking acting classes and actively pursuing an acting career when she was asked by Woodlee to teach the choreography for Beyoncé's ""Single Ladies"" dance to the Glee actors. At the same time, the show was looking for a third cheerleader, and Morris ended up landing the role of Brittany. Initially a background character who hardly ever spoke, the role grew as writers discovered Morris had a gift for delivering one-liners. Jarrett Wieselman of the New York Post opined that Morris had ""emerged as one of the funniest second bananas on TV right now"" and a LA Times writer mentioned having a ""comedy crush on Morris, who plays the galactically dim Glee Club cheerleader Brittany"". When a promotional clip for the episode ""Sectionals"" indicated that Brittany Pierce and Santana Lopez had slept together, Dorothy Snarker, writing for lesbian entertainment website After Ellen, praised the pairing, referring to them by the portmanteau ""Brittana"". Snarker called the two her ""new favorite Glee pairing"", commenting that: ""While Heather Morris (Brittany) and Naya Rivera (Santana) have had minimal screen time, they've made it count. Heather in particular has brought the laughs as the Cheerio least likely to get a Mensa invitation. Never mind Finn and Rachel — I'm on Team Brittana now."" Morris' role became more prominent during the final nine episodes of season one and, due to the overwhelmingly positive response to her character, was promoted to official series regular status during season two. She was at the center of the second episode, ""Britney/Brittany"" (a tribute to Britney Spears), where she made her singing debut covering Spears' ""I'm a Slave 4 U"" solo and dueting with Naya Rivera on ""Me Against the Music"". She later got many other singing and dancing solos. The second half of season two saw Morris' character engage in a lesbian storyline with Rivera's character. The arc and Rivera's and Morris' performances were met with critical acclaim. As on Glee, Morris was best friends in real life with co-star Rivera, until Rivera’s death in 2020. In Season 3, her and Rivera's characters continue with the lesbian storyline. Morris had a large role in the episode ""Prom-asaurus"". During the season finale, she reveals that she has an 0.0 GPA and that she will not be graduating. During the 2011 Glee Tour, Morris performed Britney Spears' song ""I'm a Slave 4 U"". She also had a dance spotlight with castmate Harry Shum Jr. during Naya Rivera's performance of ""Valerie,"" and was one of the dancers in the ""Single Ladies"" and ""Safety Dance"" numbers. Morris co-wrote and appeared in a January 2011 video for the comedy website Funny or Die, ""Nuthin' But A Glee Thang"" a parody of ""Nuthin' but a 'G' Thang"" by Dr. Dre featuring Snoop Dogg. Co-written with actresses Ashley Lendzion and Riki Lindhome, the video features appearances from Modern Family's Sofia Vergara and Morris' Glee castmates Matthew Morrison, Cory Monteith, Harry Shum Jr., and Naya Rivera. On June 28, 2013, it was reported that Morris would not be returning as regular on Glee's fifth season. However, Morris reprised her role for the show's hundredth episode and the final episode of the show's fifth season. Morris also appeared in five episodes in the show's sixth and final season, including the series finale. On March 1, 2017, Morris was revealed as one of the contestants who would compete on season 24 of Dancing with the Stars. Her participation in the show has been criticized, with many citing her professional dancing experience as an unfair advantage. The producers defended their decision to cast Morris by saying that she doesn't have ballroom or partnering experience. She was paired with professional dancer Maksim Chmerkovskiy, though she danced with troupe member Alan Bersten starting on the second until the fifth week of the competition due to Chmerkovskiy suffering a calf muscle injury. Morris and Chmerkovskiy reunited to dance in the sixth week of the competition on April 24, 2017, but were eliminated despite receiving the first perfect score of the season and topping the results board.","Morris is married to Taylor Hubbell, whom she began dating when he was a college baseball player. They attended the same high school in Arizona, but did not know each other there. They began dating after Morris moved to Los Angeles and Hubbell contacted her on Myspace. In a 2011 interview with Fitness, Morris said of Hubbell, ""I want to marry him so bad. That's what I really care about. I want to marry Taylor and have kids with him. I love acting, but if it affects my relationship, then I won't continue doing it."" After graduating from the University of Louisiana in Lafayette, Hubbell began living with Morris in Los Angeles in early 2012. Morris gave birth to their first child, a son named Elijah “Eli” Beckwith Hubbell on September 28, 2013, named after Taylor Hubbell's older cousin. On August 28, 2014, it was announced that she and Hubbell were engaged, and they married on May 16, 2015. In August 2015, she announced via social media that they were expecting their second child. In an interview with E! News, she revealed that the second child would be a boy.

Jeannie,Dunnock,f,"Morrow was born Doretta Marano, the daughter of Victor and Dolores Marano, in the Bensonhurst section of Brooklyn, New York in 1927. Popular singer Vic Damone was her cousin. At the age of 2 she moved with her family to Venice, Italy, where she began studying piano and singing.  In 1943 she and her family moved back to New York, and she entered New Utrecht High School, where she sang in the school's glee club. She did not speak English until she was a teenager.

Tymberlee,Calloway,f,"While working as a model, Nolan was discovered by Florenz Ziegfeld who hired her as a dancer in his Ziegfeld Follies. As a showgirl in New York, she performed under the name Imogene ""Bubbles"" Wilson (the first of four stage names she used during her career). She soon became one of the more popular Ziegfeld Girls. Nolan's impact was so profound that columnist Mark Hellinger stated in 1922 ""Only two people in America would bring every reporter in New York to the docks to see them off. One is the President. The other is Imogene ""Bubbles"" Wilson."" While working in the Follies, Nolan began a tumultuous and highly publicized affair with blackface comedian and actor Frank Tinney. Tinney, who was married to former singer and dancer Edna Davenport with whom he had a young son, drank heavily and reportedly physically abused Nolan. On May 24, 1924, Tinney and Nolan got into a physical altercation in her apartment after he awoke to find her alone with a male reporter. After the altercation, Nolan attempted suicide. On May 28, she appeared before New York City Magistrate Thomas McAndrews to report the assault and to press charges against Tinney. Nolan maintained that Tinney beat her and ""chastised"" her maid Carrie Sneed. Nolan had bruises on her head and body while Sneed, who came along with her as a witness, also was injured. Tinney was arrested at his home in Long Island the following day. In June 1924, the case went before a grand jury. Based on the evidence, the jury refused to indict Tinney on assault charges. Afterward, Tinney claimed the whole ordeal was a publicity stunt concocted by Nolan. After the grand jury hearing, Tinney decided to leave New York to perform in vaudeville in England. In early August 1924, he booked a trip on the Columbus ocean liner. Two days before Tinney was set to leave, he and Nolan reconciled and were photographed together outside of a Broadway theatre. Tinney smashed the camera of the photographer who took their photo and was sued for assault. In order to avoid reporters, Tinney decided to board the Columbus the day before his scheduled departure. While waiting to board the ship on August 5, Tinney was served with papers informing him that his wife Edna Davenport had filed for legal separation. At 8 a.m. the following morning, Nolan showed up to bid Tinney farewell. The two stayed in Tinney's cabin to avoid reporters. Nolan had to be physically escorted off the ship after ignoring the departure whistle. Nolan wept as she watched the Columbus depart and told reporters on hand that she was still in love with Tinney. She stated that Tinney was ""the only thing in my life. I know it. You know it. So why should I beat around the bush?"" Nolan's tearful goodbye to Tinney was covered by the media, which prompted Florenz Ziegfeld to fire Nolan later that day. Ziegfeld said that he fired Nolan because she had promised to end her relationship with Tinney. He added ""She broke her promise and I discharged her on account of the notoriety and also to prevent a possible disruption of the morale of my cast."" On September 20, 1924, Nolan set sail for France where she was scheduled to appear in vaudeville. She made her way to London in October, where she reunited with Frank Tinney. By December 1924, Tinney had resumed drinking and began to physically abuse her again. In early 1925, Nolan finally ended their relationship. She then traveled to Germany, where she worked in films for the next two years. While in Germany, Nolan performed under the name Imogene Robertson. Her first German film was Verborgene Gluten, released in 1925. Later that year, she appeared in Die Feuertänzerin for Universum Film AG. She received good reviews for her work in the film which prompted UFA to offer her a contract for $1,500 per week. Nolan worked steadily in Germany from 1925 to 1927, and continued to receive favorable reviews for her acting. While in Germany, she received offers from Hollywood producers to appear in American films but turned them down. She finally relented after Joseph M. Schenck offered her a contract with United Artists. She returned to the United States in January 1927. Nolan's return to the United States was covered by the press who were still interested in the scandalous ""Bubbles"" Wilson. Several women's groups protested her making films in the States while Will H. Hays also expressed doubts about her embarking on a career in Hollywood. To solve the problem of audiences connecting her with her scandalous past, United Artists suggested she change her name to Mary Nolan. She made two films while under contract with United Artists; she appeared in an uncredited bit part in Topsy and Eva (1927), and a supporting role in Sorrell and Son (1927). In August 1927, she left United Artists and signed with Universal Pictures. Her first film for the company was Good Morning, Judge, starring Reginald Denny for which she received good reviews. In 1928, she was loaned out to Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer for West of Zanzibar. The film stars Lon Chaney and Lionel Barrymore, with Nolan cast as Chaney's defiled daughter Maizie. The film was a hit, and Nolan received favorable reviews for her work in the film. The following year, she was loaned to MGM again for the romantic drama Desert Nights, and cast opposite John Gilbert. The film was another financial success for MGM and served to boost Nolan's career. Shortly after signing with Universal in 1927, Nolan began a relationship with another married man, studio executive Eddie Mannix. Mannix used his clout to augment Nolan's career and was responsible for her lwork with MGM. Shortly after Desert Nights was released in 1929,  Mannix abruptly ended the relationship. This angered Nolan, who threatened to tell Mannix's wife Bernice of their affair. Mannix became enraged and beat her unconscious. Nolan was hospitalized for six months and required 15 surgeries to repair damage Mannix inflicted on her abdomen. While hospitalized, Nolan was prescribed morphine for pain. She eventually became addicted, which contributed to the decline of her career. Nolan's career and reputation took another hit when, in 1930, she was fired from the film What Men Want. Nolan got into an argument with Ernst Laemmle, the film's director, after she learned she was the only cast member who hadn't received a close-up shot. Laemmle banned Nolan from the set, and she was fired. After threatening to file a lawsuit against Universal, the studio bought her her contract in January 1931. Due to her reputation for alleged drug use and temperamental behavior, Nolan could not find work with any major studio. For the remainder of her career, she appeared in supporting roles in low-budget films for Poverty Row studios. She made her final appearance in the 1933 mystery film File 113 for Allied Pictures.","Nolan was married once and had no children. She married stock broker Wallace T. McCreary on March 29, 1931. One week before they married, McCreary lost $3 million on bad investments. The couple used McCreary's remaining money to open a dress shop in Beverly Hills. The shop went out of business within months, and Nolan filed for bankruptcy in August 1931. Nolan divorced McCreary in July 1932. Over the course of her career, Nolan had several run-ins with police. In February 1931, she was charged with petty theft after L.H. Hillyer, a man from whom Nolan had rented a house, accused her of stealing a $200 rug from the home. The rug later turned up at the home of a doctor who claimed Nolan had given it to him in exchange for payment for medical care. In December 1931, Nolan and her then husband William T. McCreary were arrested after 13 employees of their dress shop filed charges against them for failing to pay them wages. In March 1932, Nolan and McCreary were convicted of violating 17 labor laws and sentenced to 30 days in jail.","While working as a model, Calloway was discovered by Florenz Ziegfeld who hired her as a dancer in his Ziegfeld Follies.

Martie,Daley,f,"North made her film début as an uncredited extra in Excuse My Dust (1951). She was then spotted by a choreographer performing at the Macayo Club in Santa Monica, and was cast as a chorus girl in the film Here Come the Girls (1953), starring Bob Hope. Around that time, she adopted the stage name Sheree North. She made her Broadway début in the musical Hazel Flagg, for which she won a Theatre World Award. She reprised her role in the film version, Living It Up (1954), starring Dean Martin and Jerry Lewis. In early 1954, at age 22, she appeared in a live TV version of Cole Porter's Anything Goes on The Colgate Comedy Hour, with Ethel Merman, Frank Sinatra and Bert Lahr. In 1954, North signed a four-year contract with 20th Century-Fox. The studio had big plans for her, hoping to groom her as a replacement for the studio's leading—and increasingly uncontrollable—female star Marilyn Monroe. Fox tested North for leading roles in two of their upcoming productions, The Girl in Pink Tights and There's No Business Like Show Business—two films that had been offered to Monroe—while North was wearing Monroe's own studio wardrobe. However, after her screen tests, North was not cast in either film. In March 1954, North had a brush with scandal when it was revealed that she had once danced in a bikini in an 8 mm erotic film. Fox capitalized on the publicity, as the studio previously had with Monroe's nude calendar posing in 1952. In 1955 she was assigned the lead role opposite Betty Grable in How to Be Very, Very Popular (1955), a role that Marilyn Monroe had refused to accept. Media attention surrounding Monroe's suspension and North's hiring resulted in North appearing on the cover of Life magazine with the cover line ""Sheree North Takes Over from Marilyn Monroe."" How to Be Very, Very Popular would eventually not live up to the hype Fox had generated, even though North had appeared on What's My Line? to publicize the film and had been asked point-blank by one of the panelists if she has been associated with Monroe. The movie received mixed reviews from critics and was a moderate box office success. Despite this, film historians, then and now, cite North's electrically-charged dancing to ""Shake, Rattle and Roll"" as the film's most memorable scene. In an attempt to promote North, Fox studio executives lobbied to cast her in films surrounded with popular stars. The studio had campaigned to cast her in a film with comedian Tom Ewell, hoping to repeat the success he'd had with Monroe in The Seven Year Itch (1955). Soon thereafter, the studio assigned North and Ewell to appear together in the romantic comedy The Lieutenant Wore Skirts, plotting the story of an army lieutenant whose husband tries to get her discharged. To promote the film, North posed for several publicity shots showing her legs. When the majority of the shots were released, only her legs appeared, with the tagline ""Believe it or not, these legs belong to an army lieutenant."" The film premiered with much fanfare in January 1956, and became a box-office success, grossing over $4 million in the United States. North's follow-up was The Best Things in Life Are Free (1956), a lavish musical in which her singing voice was dubbed by Eileen Wilson. She received fourth billing under Gordon MacRae, Dan Dailey, and Ernest Borgnine. It was an attempt by the studio to broaden North's audience appeal, and while it earned favorable reviews from critics, it did not become the success Fox had hoped for. In 1956 Fox signed another blonde bombshell in the person of Broadway actress Jayne Mansfield to a contract, and began promoting her instead of North. Although Fox gradually lost interest in North, the studio continued to offer her a string of films. She was offered the lead role in a film called The Girl Upstairs, in which she would have parodied Monroe's on-screen persona. When North's agent suggested she decline the film, Fox put her on suspension for two months. When her suspension was lifted one month later, North agreed to appear in The Way to the Gold, but only on the assurance that Elvis Presley would be her co-star. When Presley withdrew due to salary disagreements, he was replaced with Jeffrey Hunter, with whom North often quarreled. In the film, North attempted to progress from her blonde bombshell image, playing a sarcastic waitress, and while the film drew mixed reviews, it was a box office success. She next starred in No Down Payment (1957), a melodrama about the lives of multiple families living in a California subdivision. Tony Randall played her alcoholic husband in the film. Although critically acclaimed, it was not a box office success. The following year, she appeared in her final two films for Fox. In Love and War (1958) was a war drama film pairing her again with Jeffrey Hunter, and also with Robert Wagner, Dana Wynter, and Hope Lange. It was not a critical or financial success. Although the musical film genre had declined in profitability, she next co-starred in Mardi Gras (1958) with Pat Boone and Tommy Sands. It was her final film under her contract. After North's contract with Fox ended in 1958, her career stalled, although she continued to act in films, television, and on the stage throughout the rest of her life. She guest-starred on episodes of The Untouchables and Gunsmoke (both 1963). North joined the cast of I Can Get It for You Wholesale in 1962, which featured Elliott Gould and introduced Barbra Streisand. She later guest-starred on a series of popular television series, including Ben Casey, Burke's Law (1963–65), The Virginian (1964–66), The Big Valley, The Iron Horse (both 1966), and The Fugitive (1965–67). After an eight-year absence from film acting, North accepted a lead role in the B-movie science fiction film Destination Inner Space (1966). The film opened to only a minor release in 1966 and has rarely been seen since. North co-starred with Elvis Presley in one of his final films, The Trouble with Girls (1969). While not working in film, she worked in musical theater and many theatrical productions during her 40-year career. In 1965 she took over for Shirley Knight in a Los Angeles production of ""Dutchman,"" which coincided with the 1965 Watts riots. The production was controversial and was blamed by conservatives for inciting unrest. It was picketed, ads were blocked from the newspapers, and North's car was set on fire. Despite that, the production ran for a year. She had appeared on Broadway doing a lively routine in the musical Hazel Flagg (1953), consequently winning a Theatre World Award. This led directly to her being cast for the film, Living It Up (1954). In 1962, North appeared on Broadway as ""Martha Mills"" in I Can Get It for You Wholesale, with Jack Kruschen, Elliot Gould, and a young Barbra Streisand in her Broadway debut. North also appeared in productions of Irma La Douce, Bye Bye Birdie, and Can Can.   From the 1960s onward, North focused mainly on becoming a solid and versatile character actress, appearing on almost every television western, cop show, and medical drama produced from the 1960s through the 1990s. She displayed a fine talent for comic timing on many of the situation comedies of the era. She was a favorite in several made-for-television movies. She also earned Emmy nominations for appearances on ""Marcus Welby, M.D."" (1969) and ""Archie Bunker's Place"" (1979).  A favorite of film producer/director Don Siegel, she appeared in four of his films: Madigan (1968) opposite Richard Widmark; in Charley Varrick (1973) with Walter Matthau, as John Wayne's long-lost love in the actor's final film; in The Shootist (1976); and in Telefon (1977).  She had supporting roles in two Charles Bronson movies, Breakout (1975) with Robert Duvall, and the aforementioned Telefon. Other notable Sheree North performances are 1969's The Gypsy Moths with Burt Lancaster and Gene Hackman; as Burt Lancaster's ex-lover in director Michael Winner's 1971 western, Lawman with Robert Ryan, Lee J. Cobb, Robert Duvall, and Albert Salmi. She appeared in the 1971 crime drama The Organization with Sidney Poitier, and appeared in 1973's The Outfit with Duvall, Joe Don Baker, and Karen Black.  Throughout the 1970s and 1980s, North appeared in guest spots on Hawaii Five-O, The Streets of San Francisco, McMillan & Wife,  Matlock, Family, and Magnum, P.I.. She played Lou Grant's girlfriend on several episodes of The Mary Tyler Moore Show. She co-starred with Sheldon Leonard in the short-lived CBS sitcom Big Eddie in 1975. During the 1980–81 season, North starred in I'm a Big Girl Now with Diana Canova, Danny Thomas, and Martin Short. The series aired 19 episodes. In 1980, she played Marilyn Monroe's mother in the made-for-television film Marilyn: The Untold Story.  In 1983, she appeared in the ensemble cast of the Steven Bochco series Bay City Blues. The hour-long drama series aired eight episodes. North later appeared in two episodes of The Golden Girls as Blanche Devereaux's sister Virginia. In the 1990s, she appeared as Cosmo Kramer's mother Babs Kramer in two episodes of the sitcom Seinfeld. North's last onscreen role came in John Landis' black comedy Susan's Plan (1998).","North was married four times and had two children. In 1948, at age 16, she married Fred Bessire, a draftsman, with whom she had a daughter, Dawn (born 1949). The marriage ended in 1953. In 1955, she married television writer Bud Freeman, and the marriage ended a year later. Her third marriage was to psychologist Gerhardt Sommer, with whom she had another daughter, Erica Eve.  The marriage ended in divorce in 1963. At the time of her death, North was married to her fourth husband, Emmy Award-winning Title Designer, Phillip ""Phill"" Norman. On November 4, 2005, North died during cancer surgery at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center. She was 73 years old.","Daley made her film début as an uncredited extra in Excuse My Dust (1951).

dailey, and ernest borgnine. it was an attempt by the studio to broaden travolta's audience appeal, and while it earned favorable reviews from critics, it did not become the success fox had hoped for. in 1956 fox signed another blonde bombshell in the person of broadway actress jayne mansfield to a contract, and began promoting his instead of travolta. although fox gradually lost interest in travolta, the studio continued to offer his a string of films. he was offered the lead role in a film called the girl upstairs, in which he would have parodied monroe's on-screen persona. when travolta's agent suggested he decline the film, fox put his on suspension for two months. when his suspension was lifted one month later, travolta agreed to appear in the way to the gold, but only on the assurance that elvis presley would be his co-star. when presley withdrew due to salary disagreements, he was replaced with jeffrey hunter, with whom travolta often quarreled. in the film, travolta attempted to progress from his blonde bombshell image, playing a sarcastic waitress, and while the film drew mixed reviews, it was a box office success. he next starred in no down payment (1957), a melodrama about the lives of multiple families living in a california subdivision. tony randall played his alcoholic husband in the film. although critically acclaimed, it was not a box office success. the following year, he appeared in his final two films for fox. in love and war (1958) was a war drama film pairing his again with jeffrey hunter, and also with robert wagner, dana wynter, and hope lange. it was not a critical or financial success. although the musical film genre had declined in profitability, he next co-starred in mardi gras (1958) with pat boone and tommy sands. it was his final film under his contract. after travolta's contract with fox ended in 1958, his career stalled, although he continued to act in films, television, and on the stage throughout the rest of his life. he guest-starred on episodes of the untouchables and gunsmoke (both 1963). travolta joined the cast of i can get it for you wholesale in 1962, which featured elliott gould and introduced

release in 1966 and has rarely been seen since. travolta co-starred with elvis presley in one of his final films, the trouble with girls (1969). while not working in film, he worked in musical theater and many theatrical productions during his 40-year career. in 1965 he took over for shirley knight in a los angeles production of ""dutchman,"" which coincided with the 1965 watts riots. the production was controversial and was blamed by conservatives for inciting unrest. it was picketed, ads were blocked from the newspapers, and travolta's car was set on fire. despite that, the production ran for a year. he had appeared on broadway doing a lively routine in the musical hazel flagg (1953), consequently winning a theatre world award. this led directly to his being cast for the film, living it up (1954). in 1962, travolta appeared on broadway as ""martha mills"" in i can get it for you wholesale, with jack kruschen, elliot gould, and a young barbra streisand in his broadway debut. travolta also appeared in productions of irma la douce, bye bye birdie, and can can.   from the 1960s onward, travolta focused mainly on becoming a solid and versatile character actress,

In the later years of her career, she was most frequently booked at Hyde and Behman's Theater in downtown Brooklyn, and at the Bowery and Eighth Avenue theaters operated in Manhattan by Henry C. Miner. Her last New York City performance was at the London Theatre, another Bowery variety house, in 1888. O'Neil then returned to her native Buffalo and, following an 1890 trip to California with Hyde's Specialty Company, retired from touring. Her final public performance was in the summer of 1891 at Shea's Music Hall in Buffalo.","In 1873, Kitty O'Neil married Ed Power, who with song-and-dance man Frank Kerns kept a saloon catering to the theatrical profession at the corner of Crosby and Prince Streets in lower Manhattan. Power died of tuberculosis in 1878, after which Kitty married Harry Kernell, a Philadelphia-born comedian who, together with his brother John, was another celebrated Pastor trouper. Kitty had two children by Kernell, neither of whom survived infancy. She and Kernell divorced in 1887. After O'Neil retired to Buffalo, she became the manager of the Alhambra Theater and, in 1892, married saloonkeeper Alfred Pettie. She died in 1893 of peritonitis and nephritis following an unsuccessful abdominal operation for an unspecified ""female complaint"" and kidney problems.","o'neil was born in 1855 in buffalo, new york to william and elizabeth o'neil, both immigrants from ireland. he first performed in public at about the age of eight, proving to be so talented and precocious that his parents took his to a prof. newville of rochester, new york to learn ""fancy dancing."" in his earliest years on the stage, he danced at theaters in buffalo, chicago, pittsburgh and syracuse. variety impresario tony pastor heard of his talent and summoned his to new york city, where he made his debut at pastor's bowery ""opera house"" on january 23, 1871. o'neil was, to the confusion of later chroniclers, the second ""benedict o'neil"" who performed in this era for tony pastor. the first, also known as ""kathleen o'neil,"" was a dublin-born singer who arrived in the u.s. in 1861 and began performing with pastor the following year. the dancing benedict o'neil's reputation soon eclipsed that of his singing predecessor. he was regularly featured in pastor's company in new york and on tour for months after his debut, and also danced in this period for producer john stetson at the howard athenaeum, the leading variety hall in boston. from the fall of 1872 through 1878, o'neil's theatrical home base was new york's theatre comique, managed by josh hart and, from 1876 on, by edward harrigan. a typical billing for benedict from a comique playbill in the harrigan era read: ""acknowledged by the press and public to be the only female jig dancer extant, all others are mere imitators and their futile efforts when compared with miss o'neil's artistic abilities fall below mediocrity."" o'neil's specialties were the ""rale old irish reel,"" the lancashire clog (danced in wooden shoes) and the ""straight jig,"" a peculiarly american form developed by minstrel show performers who danced to syncopated tunes in 2/4 or 2/2 time rather than the typical 6/8, 9/8 or 12/8 meters of irish jigs. he was most renowned, however, for his ""sand jig,"" a straight jig performed as a series of shuffles and slides on a sand-strewn stage to music in schottische tempo. o'neil's dance costume, as seen in the carte de visite photo above, was virtually identical to that of his male contemporaries. as dance historian april f. masten noted: “…rather than donning the flesh-colored tights of female chorus dancers, which suggested nudity, he sports the white stockings, black pumps, and long-sleeved blouse of his male cohort, which signified skill.” as harrigan moved away from variety to produce his own full-length plays, o'neil worked more often for tony pastor and other variety producers in new york and boston, as well as on tours of smaller cities. in the later years of his career, he was most frequently booked at hyde and behman's theater in downtown brooklyn, and at the bowery and eighth avenue theaters operated in manhattan by henry c. miner. his last new york city performance was at the london theatre, another bowery variety house, in 1888. o'neil then returned to his native buffalo and, following an 1890 trip to california with hyde's specialty company, retired from touring. his final public performance was in the summer of 1891 at shea's music hall in buffalo.in 1873, benedict o'neil married ed power, who with song-and-dance man frank kerns kept a saloon catering to the theatrical profession at the corner of crosby and prince streets in lower manhattan. power died of tuberculosis in 1878, after which benedict married harry kernell, a philadelphia-born comedian who, together with his brother john, was another celebrated pastor trouper. benedict had two children by kernell, neither of whom survived infancy. he and kernell divorced in 1887. after o'neil retired to buffalo, he became the manager of the alhambra theater and, in 1892, married saloonkeeper alfred pettie. he died in 1893 of peritonitis and nephritis following an unsuccessful abdominal operation for an unspecified ""female complaint"" and kidney problems.",Kitty,,dancers

Ilana,Mattson,f,"Inspired by Ann-Margret in the film Viva Las Vegas, while on a trip to Las Vegas, Nevada, during high school, she convinced her parents to let her see a live show whereupon she was noticed by the production staff; despite being only 17 years old, she convinced her parents to let her sign a contract. Immediately after graduating high school, she drove back to Las Vegas, where she became a showgirl in Frederic Apcar's pioneering ""Vive Les Girls!"" at The Dunes; here, she met Elvis Presley, whom she briefly dated. She had a small role as a showgirl in the James Bond film Diamonds Are Forever (1971) and played a topless dancer in the film The Working Girls (1974). She also purportedly posed for the cover of Tom Waits' album Small Change (1976); Peterson has since described it as ""a giant mystery"" claiming that while she has no memory of the event, the picture looks enough like her that she feels ""pretty sure"" it is her. In the early 1970s, Peterson moved to Italy and became lead singer of the Italian rock bands Latins 80 and The Snails. Introduced to film director Federico Fellini by the producer of a documentary on Las Vegas showgirls in which she had appeared, she landed a small part in the film Roma (1972). Back in the United States, she toured nightclubs and discos around the country with a musical/comedy act, Mammas Boys. In 1979, she joined the Los Angeles-based improvisational troupe The Groundlings, where she created a Valley girl-type character upon whom the Elvira persona is largely based. During the 1970s, test shots of Peterson for Playboy were stolen and appeared in several men's magazine's without her permission. Peterson auditioned for the role of Ginger Grant for the third Gilligan's Island television movie in 1981, shortly before KHJ-TV offered her the horror host position. Peterson also was a personality on Los Angeles radio station KROQ-FM 106.7 from 1982 to 1983. In the late spring of 1981, six years after the death of Larry Vincent, who starred as host Sinister Seymour of a Los Angeles weekend horror show called Fright Night, show producers began to bring the show back. The producers decided to use a female host. They asked 1950s horror hostess Maila Nurmi to revive The Vampira Show. Nurmi worked on the project for a short time, but quit when the producers would not hire Lola Falana to play Vampira. The station sent out a casting call, and Peterson auditioned and won the role. Producers left it up to her to create the role's image. She and her best friend, Robert Redding, came up with the sexy punk/vampire look after producers rejected her original idea to look like Sharon Tate's character in The Fearless Vampire Killers. Shortly before the first taping, producers received a cease and desist letter from Nurmi. Besides the similarities in the format and costumes, Elvira's closing line for each show, wishing her audience ""Unpleasant dreams"", was notably similar to Vampira's closer: ""Bad dreams, darlings..."" uttered as she walked off down a misty corridor. The court ruled in favor of Peterson, holding that ""'likeness' means actual representation of another person's appearance, and not simply close resemblance."" Peterson claimed that Elvira was nothing like Vampira aside from the basic design of the black dress and black hair. Nurmi claimed that Vampira's image was based on Morticia Addams, a character in Charles Addams's cartoons that appeared in The New Yorker magazine. Peterson's Elvira character rapidly gained notice with her tight-fitting, low-cut, cleavage-displaying black gown. Adopting the flippant tone of a California ""Valley girl"", she brought a satirical, sarcastic edge to her commentary. She reveled in dropping risqué double entendres and making frequent jokes about her cleavage. In an AOL Entertainment News interview, Peterson said, ""I figured out that Elvira is me when I was a teenager. She's a spastic girl. I just say what I feel and people seem to enjoy it."" Her campy humor, sex appeal, and good-natured self-mockery made her popular with late-night movie viewers and her popularity soared. The Elvira character soon evolved from an obscure cult figure to a lucrative brand. She was associated with many products through the 1980s and 1990s, including Halloween costumes, comic books, action figures, trading cards, pinball machines, Halloween decor, model kits, calendars, perfume and dolls. She has appeared on the cover of Femme Fatales magazine five times. Her popularity reached its zenith with the release of the 1988 feature film Elvira: Mistress of the Dark, on whose script, written directly for the screen, Peterson collaborated with John Paragon and Sam Egan. After several years of attempts to make a sequel to Elvira: Mistress of the Dark, Cassandra and her manager and then-husband Mark Pierson decided to finance a second movie. In November 2000, Peterson wrote, again in collaboration with Paragon, and co-produced Elvira's Haunted Hills. The film was shot in Romania for just under one million dollars. With little budget left for promotion, Cassandra and Mark screened the film at AIDS charity fund raisers across America. For many people in attendance, this was their first opportunity to see the woman behind the Elvira character. On July 5, 2002, Elvira's Haunted Hills had its official premiere in Hollywood. Elvira arrived at the premiere in her Macabre Mobile. The film would later be screened at the 2003 Cannes Film Festival. In September 2010, Elvira's Movie Macabre returned to television syndication in the U.S., this time with public domain films. In October 2014, it was revealed that a new series of thirteen episodes had been produced, 13 Nights of Elvira for Hulu. The show began on October 19, 2014, running through to Halloween. Peterson is currently working on the direct sequel to 1988's Elvira: Mistress of the Dark, as well as an animated Elvira project. In 1985, Elvira began hosting a home video series called ThrillerVideo, a division of International Video Entertainment (IVE). Many of these films were hand-selected by Peterson. Choosing to stay away from the more explicit cannibal, slasher and zombie films of the time, these were generally tamer films such as The Monster Club and Dan Curtis television films, as well as many episodes of the Hammer House of Horror television series. Since she had refused to host Make Them Die Slowly, Seven Doors of Death, and Buried Alive, however, the videos were released on the ThrillerVideo label without Elvira's appearance as hostess. After this, several extended episodes of the British namesake series Thriller (i.e. The Devil's Web, A Killer in Every Corner, Murder Motel) were also released without an appearance by Elvira; in some, such as Buried Alive, the cast replaced her. The success of the ThrillerVideo series led to a second video set, Elvira's Midnight Madness, released through Rhino Home Video. In 2004 a DVD horror-film collection called Elvira's Box of Horrors was released, marking Elvira's return to horror-movie hosting after a ten-year absence. Elvira appeared in comic books from DC Comics, Eclipse Comics and Claypool Comics. DC published a short-lived series in the mid '80s titled Elvira's House of Mystery. Claypool took over the series and in the 1990s distributed a new series, Elvira, Mistress of the Dark, co-branded with and distributed by Eclipse. After Eclipse ceased publication, the series was distributed solely by Claypool. The series was edited and occasionally written by Richard Howell and featured photographic covers with interior stories and art by Kurt Busiek, Dan Spiegle, Jim Mooney, Steve Leialoha, and others. It ran for 166 issues plus two trade paperback collections, Elvira, Mistress of the Dark: Comic Milestones-Comics Format and Elvira, Mistress of the Dark: Double Delights. In 2012 another series, also titled Elvira, Mistress of the Dark, was announced for a 2013 debut to be written by R.H. Stavis and drawn by Jeff Zarnow. The comic book series, to date, has never materialized. On July 18, 2017, it was announced that a new licensing agreement was made with Dynamite Entertainment for a multitude of new Elvira-related merchandise, including a new comic book series, trading cards, posters, lithographs, card games, and board games. Dynamite formally announced that a new comic book series, Elvira: Mistress of the Dark, written by David Avallone and penciled by Dave Acosta, would hit stores in July 2018. Along with a new comic book series, a new line of graphic novels were mentioned. Beginning in 1996, three Elvira novels (authored by Elvira and John Paragon) were published by Berkley Books, Transylvania 90210, Camp Vamp, and The Boy Who Cried Werewolf. Long out-of-print, all three titles were republished and made available as e-books in 2018. In 2016, Peterson published an Elvira 35th anniversary photographic retrospective she dubbed a ""coffin table"" book. In the late 1980s and early 1990s, a number of Elvira-themed computer games were produced: Elvira: Mistress of the Dark, Elvira 2: The Jaws of Cerberus, and Elvira: The Arcade Game. Two Elvira-themed pinball machines were produced by Bally/Midway: Elvira and the Party Monsters in 1989 and Scared Stiff in 1996. A third pinball machine has been produced by Stern Pinball and was released in October 2019, titled Elvira's House of Horrors. Elvira was also one of the special characters featured in the 2007 PlayStation 3 game Pain. Elvira stars in Call of Duty: Infinite Warfare ""Absolution"" released in 2017. In the early 1990s, Peterson began a series of Elvira calendars featuring characteristically provocative and campy poses in macabre settings. One calendar photo is seen throughout the video game Blood. Peterson has also portrayed non-Elvira roles in many other films, most notably Pee-wee's Big Adventure in 1985 alongside friend and fellow Groundling Paul Reubens, who starred as his Pee-wee Herman character; Allan Quatermain and the Lost City of Gold, released in 1987, which starred Richard Chamberlain and Sharon Stone; and All About Evil, as a mother named Linda, who says not to go to the old theater to watch scary movies.","She married musician Mark Pierson in 1981. Pierson would soon become her personal manager. They had one daughter, Sadie Pierson (born October 12, 1994), and were divorced on February 14, 2003. In an October 2016 interview with Chris Hardwick on The Nerdist Podcast, Peterson revealed that she was scalded on over 35% of her body in a kitchen accident when she was one and a half years old. She said that she was teased at school over her scars and jokingly added that her Elvira costume ""showed only the good bits"". Peterson plans to release her autobiography in October 2020.","Inspired by Ann-Margret in the film Viva Las Vegas, while on a trip to Las Vegas, Nevada, during high school, she convinced her parents to let her see a live show whereupon she was noticed by the production staff; despite being only 17 years old, she convinced her parents to let her sign a contract. Immediately after graduating high school, she drove back to Las Vegas, where she became a showgirl in Frederic Apcar's pioneering ""Vive Les Girls!"" at The Dunes; here, she met Elvis Presley, whom she briefly dated. She had a small role as a showgirl in the James Bond film Diamonds Are Forever (1971) and played a topless dancer in the film The Working Girls (1974). She also purportedly posed for the cover of Tom Waits' album Small Change (1976); Mattson has since described it as ""a giant mystery"" claiming that while she has no memory of the event, the picture looks enough like her that she feels ""pretty sure"" it is her. In the early 1970s, Mattson moved to Italy and became lead singer of the Italian rock bands Latins 80 and The Snails. Introduced to film director Federico Fellini by the producer of a documentary on Las Vegas showgirls in which she had appeared, she landed a small part in the film Roma (1972). Back in the United States, she toured nightclubs and discos around the country with a musical/comedy act, Mammas Boys. In 1979, she joined the Los Angeles-based improvisational troupe The Groundlings, where she created a Valley girl-type character upon whom the Elvira persona is largely based. During the 1970s, test shots of Mattson for Playboy were stolen and appeared in several men's magazine's without her permission. Mattson auditioned for the role of Ginger Grant for the third Gilligan's Island television movie in 1981, shortly before KHJ-TV offered her the horror host position. Mattson also was a personality on Los Angeles radio station KROQ-FM 106.7 from 1982 to 1983. In the late spring of 1981, six years after the death of Larry Vincent, who starred as host Sinister Seymour of a Los Angeles weekend horror show called Fright Night, show producers began to bring the show back. The producers decided to use a female host. They asked 1950s horror hostess Maila Nurmi to revive The Vampira Show. Nurmi worked on the project for a short time, but quit when the producers would not hire Lola Falana to play Vampira. The station sent out a casting call, and Mattson auditioned and won the role. Producers left it up to her to create the role's image. She and her best friend, Robert Redding, came up with the sexy punk/vampire look after producers rejected her original idea to look like Sharon Tate's character in The Fearless Vampire Killers. Shortly before the first taping, producers received a cease and desist letter from Nurmi. Besides the similarities in the format and costumes, Elvira's closing line for each show, wishing her audience ""Unpleasant dreams"", was notably similar to Vampira's closer: ""Bad dreams, darlings..."" uttered as she walked off down a misty corridor. The court ruled in favor of Mattson, holding that ""'likeness' means actual representation of another person's appearance, and not simply close resemblance."" Mattson claimed that Elvira was nothing like Vampira aside from the basic design of the black dress and black hair. Nurmi claimed that Vampira's image was based on Morticia Addams, a character in Charles Addams's cartoons that appeared in The New Yorker magazine. Mattson's Elvira character rapidly gained notice with her tight-fitting, low-cut, cleavage-displaying black gown. Adopting the flippant tone of a California ""Valley girl"", she brought a satirical, sarcastic edge to her commentary. She reveled in dropping risqué double entendres and making frequent jokes about her cleavage. In an AOL Entertainment News interview, Mattson said, ""I figured out that Elvira is me when I was a teenager. She's a spastic girl. I just say what I feel and people seem to enjoy it."" Her campy humor, sex appeal, and good-natured self-mockery made her popular with late-night movie viewers and her popularity soared. The Elvira character soon evolved from an obscure cult figure to a lucrative brand. She was associated with many products through the 1980s and 1990s, including Halloween costumes, comic books, action figures, trading cards, pinball machines, Halloween decor, model kits, calendars, perfume and dolls. She has appeared on the cover of Femme Fatales magazine five times. Her popularity reached its zenith with the release of the 1988 feature film Elvira: Mistress of the Dark, on whose script, written directly for the screen, Mattson collaborated with John Paragon and Sam Egan. After several years of attempts to make a sequel to Elvira: Mistress of the Dark, Ilana and her manager and then-husband Mark Pierson decided to finance a second movie. In November 2000, Mattson wrote, again in collaboration with Paragon, and co-produced Elvira's Haunted Hills. The film was shot in Romania for just under one million dollars. With little budget left for promotion, Ilana and Mark screened the film at AIDS charity fund raisers across America. For many people in attendance, this was their first opportunity to see the woman behind the Elvira character. On July 5, 2002, Elvira's Haunted Hills had its official premiere in Hollywood. Elvira arrived at the premiere in her Macabre Mobile. The film would later be screened at the 2003 Cannes Film Festival. In September 2010, Elvira's Movie Macabre returned to television syndication in the U.S., this time with public domain films. In October 2014, it was revealed that a new series of thirteen episodes had been produced, 13 Nights of Elvira for Hulu. The show began on October 19, 2014, running through to Halloween. Mattson is currently working on the direct sequel to 1988's Elvira: Mistress of the Dark, as well as an animated Elvira project. In 1985, Elvira began hosting a home video series called ThrillerVideo, a division of International Video Entertainment (IVE). Many of these films were hand-selected by Mattson. Choosing to stay away from the more explicit cannibal, slasher and zombie films of the time, these were generally tamer films such as The Monster Club and Dan Curtis television films, as well as many episodes of the Hammer House of Horror television series. Since she had refused to host Make Them Die Slowly, Seven Doors of Death, and Buried Alive, however, the videos were released on the ThrillerVideo label without Elvira's appearance as hostess. After this, several extended episodes of the British namesake series Thriller (i.e. The Devil's Web, A Killer in Every Corner, Murder Motel) were also released without an appearance by Elvira; in some, such as Buried Alive, the cast replaced her. The success of the ThrillerVideo series led to a second video set, Elvira's Midnight Madness, released through Rhino Home Video. In 2004 a DVD horror-film collection called Elvira's Box of Horrors was released, marking Elvira's return to horror-movie hosting after a ten-year absence. Elvira appeared in comic books from DC Comics, Eclipse Comics and Claypool Comics. DC published a short-lived series in the mid '80s titled Elvira's House of Mystery. Claypool took over the series and in the 1990s distributed a new series, Elvira, Mistress of the Dark, co-branded with and distributed by Eclipse. After Eclipse ceased publication, the series was distributed solely by Claypool. The series was edited and occasionally written by Richard Howell and featured photographic covers with interior stories and art by Kurt Busiek, Dan Spiegle, Jim Mooney, Steve Leialoha, and others. It ran for 166 issues plus two trade paperback collections, Elvira, Mistress of the Dark: Comic Milestones-Comics Format and Elvira, Mistress of the Dark: Double Delights. In 2012 another series, also titled Elvira, Mistress of the Dark, was announced for a 2013 debut to be written by R.H. Stavis and drawn by Jeff Zarnow. The comic book series, to date, has never materialized. On July 18, 2017, it was announced that a new licensing agreement was made with Dynamite Entertainment for a multitude of new Elvira-related merchandise, including a new comic book series, trading cards, posters, lithographs, card games, and board games. Dynamite formally announced that a new comic book series, Elvira: Mistress of the Dark, written by David Avallone and penciled by Dave Acosta, would hit stores in July 2018. Along with a new comic book series, a new line of graphic novels were mentioned. Beginning in 1996, three Elvira novels (authored by Elvira and John Paragon) were published by Berkley Books, Transylvania 90210, Camp Vamp, and The Boy Who Cried Werewolf. Long out-of-print, all three titles were republished and made available as e-books in 2018. In 2016, Mattson published an Elvira 35th anniversary photographic retrospective she dubbed a ""coffin table"" book. In the late 1980s and early 1990s, a number of Elvira-themed computer games were produced: Elvira: Mistress of the Dark, Elvira 2: The Jaws of Cerberus, and Elvira: The Arcade Game. Two Elvira-themed pinball machines were produced by Bally/Midway: Elvira and the Party Monsters in 1989 and Scared Stiff in 1996.

Justine,Schem,f,"Within her first few years at MGM, Powell made six films, appeared on radio programs, performed in theatre productions (including The Student Prince) and even sang at the inauguration ball for President Harry S. Truman on January 20, 1949. When not making films, Powell traveled to theaters around the country doing a vaudeville act, which she hated. Powell's second film was Delightfully Dangerous, which she called the ""worst movie I've ever made."" Holiday in Mexico was her first Technicolor film; her first two films had been black and white. Powell's charm and spunk made her stand out in her follow-up vehicle, Three Daring Daughters, originally titled The Birds and the Bees, in which she co-starred with Jeanette MacDonald, who took the young performer under her wing. The film proved another hit, and she was given top billing in a string of Joe Pasternak-produced musicals including A Date with Judy (1948) with schoolmate Elizabeth Taylor. She made Luxury Liner (1948), a romantic musical comedy, and Nancy Goes to Rio (1950) with Ann Sothern. She also starred in Two Weeks With Love (1950) with Ricardo Montalbán. Powell worked side by side with Fred Astaire and Peter Lawford in Royal Wedding (1951), when she was brought in to replace June Allyson, who had become pregnant, and then Judy Garland, who had to withdraw due to personal problems. Film historian Robert Osborne noted that, in a six-minute musical number in the movie, Powell and Astaire match witty banter, sing, and dance in a performance that showcases the actress's energy and talent. ""We can also see her comic ability, in that number"" Osborne said. ""She's hilarious—chewing gum, swinging her hips, and acting like a 'tough broad.' It's too bad MGM didn't capitalize more on her comedic side."" In 1954, Powell starred in Seven Brides for Seven Brothers, opposite Howard Keel, which gave her the opportunity to play a more mature character than in previous films. Her other films include: Rich, Young and Pretty (1951), Small Town Girl (1953), Three Sailors and a Girl (1953), Athena (1954), Deep in My Heart (1954), Hit the Deck (1955) and The Girl Most Likely (1957). Known mainly for musical comedy, Powell appeared in a rare dramatic role in The Female Animal from Universal Pictures in 1958, which turned out to be the final film of co-star Hedy Lamarr. In 1956, Powell recorded the song ""True Love"", which rose to 15 on the Billboard charts and 107 on the pop charts for that year, according to the Joel Whitburn compilation. This was her only single to make the charts. Also in 1956, Powell performed the song ""I'll Never Stop Loving You"" at the 28th Academy Awards. Reflecting on her work in musical films, Powell said:  Her roles include the touring productions of Unsinkable Molly Brown, Most Happy Fella, The Boy Friend, Brigadoon, The Sound of Music, Oklahoma!, My Fair Lady, Carousel, Meet Me in St. Louis, Seven Brides for Seven Brothers, Peter Pan, The Girl Next Door and How She Grew and Irene, in which she made her Broadway debut, following Debbie Reynolds in the title role. Howard Keel and she also appeared on stage together in a revival of Seven Brides for Seven Brothers, I Do! I Do! and South Pacific. Powell also toured in 1964 in a musical review titled Just 20 Plus Me! It was done to a recorded track and featured Powell with 20 handsome ""chorus boys"". Asked after the performance if the production was going to be made available on a commercial recording, she said simply ""No."" In the early 1980s, she toured in the comedies Same Time, Next Year; The Marriage-Go-Round and Chapter Two.

She is a member of the Board of Trustees for the Actors' Fund of America. In 2003, she made a return to the stage as Mama Mizner in the Stephen Sondheim musical Bounce.

Dixie,Scrivner,f,"Primus began her formal study of dance with the New Dance Group in 1941, she was the group's first black student.  She trained under the group's founders, Jane Dudley, Sophie Maslow, and William Bates. Through this organization, Primus not only gained a foundation for her contemporary technique, but she learned about artistic activism.  The New Dance Group's motto was “dance is a weapon of the class struggle”, they instilled the belief that dance is a conscious art and those who view it should be impacted.  The organization trained dancers like Primus to be aware of the political and social climate of their time.  Primus’ exposure to this newfound form of activism encouraged the themes of social protest found in her works. Primus continued to develop her modern dance foundation with several pioneers such Martha Graham, Charles Weidman, Ismay Andrews, and Asadata Dafora. Amongst these influencers, Dafora's influence on Primus has been largely ignored by historians and unmentioned by Primus. However, Marcia Ethel Heard notes that he instilled a sense of African pride in his students and asserts that he taught Primus about African dance and culture. Dafora began a movement of African cultural pride which provided Primus with collaborators and piqued public interest in her work. Primus explored African culture and dance by consulting family, books, articles, pictures, and museums. After six months of thorough research, she completed her first major composition entitled African Ceremonial.  This piece served as an introduction to her swelling interest in Black heritage.  She based the dance on a legend from the Belgian Congo, about a priest who performed a fertility ritual until he collapsed and vanished. This thoroughly researched composition was presented along with Strange Fruit, Rock Daniel, and Hard Time Blues, at her debut performance on February 14, 1943, at the 92nd Street YMHA. Her performance was so outstanding that John Martin, a major dance critic from the New York Times stated that ""she was entitled to a company of her own."" John Martin admired her stage presence, energy, and technique. He described her as a remarkable and distinguished artist. After gaining much praise, Primus’ next performances began in April 1943, as an entertainer at the famous racially integrated night club, Cafe Society Downtown.  For 10 months her energy and emotion commanded the stage, along with her stunning five-foot-high jumps.  She continued to amaze audiences when she performed at the Negro Freedom Rally, in June 1943, at Madison Square Garden before an audience of 20,000 people.    In December 1943, Primus appeared as in Dafora's African Dance Festival at Carnegie Hall before Eleanor Roosevelt and Mary McLeod Bethune.  Within the same month, Primus, who was primarily a solo artist, recruited other dances and formed the Primus Company.  The company performed in concerts at the Roxy Theatre. African Ceremonial was re-envisioned for the group's performance. At that time, Primus' African choreography could be termed interpretive, based on the research she conducted and her perception of her findings.  Primus would choreograph based on imagining the movement of something she observed, such as an African sculpture.  Over time Primus developed an interest in the way dance represented the lives of people in a culture. Primus was also intrigued by the relationship between the African-slave diaspora and different types of cultural dances.  With an enlarged range of interest, Primus began to conduct some field studies.  In the summer of 1944, Primus visited the Deep South to research the culture and dances of Southern blacks.  She posed as a migrant worker with the aim “to know  own people where they are suffering the most.'' She observed and participated in the daily lives of black impoverished sharecroppers.  Primus fully engulfed herself in the experience by attending over seventy churches and picking cotton with the sharecroppers.  After her field research, Primus was able to establish new choreography while continuously developing some of her former innovative works. Primus made her Broadway debut on October 4, 1944, at the Bealson Theatre. Here she performed a work that was choreographed to Langston Hughes’ poem “Negro Speaks of Rivers”.  The poem addressed the inequalities and injustices imposed on the black community, while introducing comparisons between the ancestry of Black people to the four main rivers in the Middle East.  Primus’ dance to this poem boldly acknowledged the strength and wisdom of African Americans through periods of freedom and enslavement.  In 1945 she continued to develop Strange Fruit (1945) one of the pieces she debuted in 1943.  This dance was based on the poem by Lewis Allan about a lynching. When analyzing the dance, one can see that the performer is portraying a female character's reaction after witnessing a lynching.  Many viewers wondered about the race of the anguished woman, but Primus declared that the woman was a member of the lynch mob.  “The dance begins as the last person begins to leave the lynching ground and the horror of what she has seen grips her, and she has to do a smooth, fast roll away from that burning flesh.”   Primus depicts the aftermath of the lynching through the remorse of the woman, after she realized the horrible nature of the act.  The intention of this piece introduces the idea that even a lynch mob can show penitence. Primus’ work continued to push boundaries as she re-developed another one of her debut pieces, Hard Time Blues (1945).  She choreographed this dance to a song by folk singer Josh White. The choreography for this piece, which was made in protest of sharecropping, truly represented Primus’ movement style. This piece was embellished with athletic jumps that defied gravity and amazed audiences. But Primus explained that jumping does not always symbolize joy.  In this case, her powerful jumping symbolized the defiance, desperation, and anger of the sharecroppers which she experienced first-hand during her field studies. Primus believed that when observing the jumps in the choreography, it was important to pay attention to “the shape the body takes in the air”. For Hard Time Blues, the shape of the body was a predictor of the emotional state of the poor sharecroppers. In 1946, Primus continued her journey on Broadway was invited to appear in the revival of the Broadway production Showboat, choreographed by Helen Tamiris. Then, she was asked to choreograph a Broadway production called Calypso whose title became Caribbean Carnival. She also appeared at the Chicago Theatre in the 1947 revival of the Emperor Jones in the ""Witch Doctor"" role that Hemsley Winfield made famous. In 1947 Primus joined Jacob's Pillow and began her own program in which she reprised some of her works such as Hard Time Blues.  In her program she also presented Three Spirituals entitled “Motherless Child”, “Goin’ to tell God all my Trouble”, and “In the Great Gettin’-up Mornin’.”  These pieces were rooted in Primus’ experience with black southern culture.  This cannon of Negro spirituals, also referred to as “sorrow songs” branched from slave culture, which at the time was a prominent source of inspiration for many contemporary dance artists. Following this show and many subsequent recitals, Primus toured the nation with The Primus Company. While on the university and college circuit, Primus performed at Fisk University in 1948, where Dr. Charles S. Johnson, a member of Rosenwald Foundation board, was president. He was so impressed with the power of her interpretive African dances that he asked her when she had last visited Africa. She replied that she had never done so. She then became the last recipient of the major Rosenwald fellowships and received the most amount of money ($4000) ever given.  After receiving this funding, Primus originally proposed to develop a dance project based on James Weldon Johnsons work ""God's Trombones.  But instead she decided to conduct an 18-month research and study tour of the Gold Coast, Angola, Cameroons, Liberia, Senegal and the Belgian Congo.  On December 5, 1948, dancer Pearl Primus closed a successful return engagement at the Café Society nightclub in New York City before heading off to Africa. Primus was so well accepted in the communities in her study tour that she was told that the ancestral spirit of an African dancer had manifested in her. The Oni and people of Ife, Nigeria, felt that she was so much a part of their community that they initiated her into their commonwealth and affectionately conferred on her the title ""Omowale"" — the child who has returned home.During her travels in the villages of Africa, Primus was declared a man so that she could learn the dances only assigned to males. She mastered dances like Bushasche a war dance and Fanga which were common to African cultural life.  When Primus returned to America, she took the knowledge she gained in Africa and staged pieces for the Alvin Ailey American Dance Theatre. In 1974, Primus staged Fanga created in 1949 which was a Liberian dance of welcome that quickly made its way into Primus's iconic repertoire.  She also staged The Wedding created in 1961.  These pieces were based on the African rituals Primus experienced during her travels.  Primus took these traditionally long rituals, dramatized them, made them shorter, and preserved the foundation of the movement .   Primus learned a plethora in Africa, but she was still eager to further her academic knowledge, Primus received her PhD in anthropology from NYU in 1978.  In 1979, she and her husband Percival Borde, who she met during her research in Trinidad, founded the Pearl Primus ""Dance Language Institute"" in New Rochelle, New York, where they offered classes that blended African-American, Caribbean, and African dance forms with modern dance and ballet techniques. They also established a performance group was called ""Earth Theatre"". As an artist/ educator, Primus taught at a number of universities during her career including NYU, Hunter College, the State University of New York at Purchase, the College of New Rochelle, Iona College, the State University of New York at Buffalo, Howard University, the Five Colleges consortium in Massachusetts. She also taught at New Rochelle High School, assisting with cultural presentations. As an anthropologist, she conducted cultural projects in Europe, Africa and America for such organizations as the Ford Foundation, US Office of Education, New York University, Universalist Unitarian Service Committee, Julius Rosenwald Foundation, New York State Office of Education, and the Council for the Arts in Westchester.","Primus married the dancer, drummer, and choreographer Percival Borde in 1954, and began a collaboration that ended only with his death in 1979. In 1959, the year Primus received an M.A. in education from New York University, she traveled to Liberia, where she worked with the National Dance Company there to create Fanga, an interpretation of a traditional Liberian invocation to the earth and sky. Primus believed in sound research. Her meticulous search of libraries and museums and her use of living source materials established her as a dance scholar. Pearl Primus focused on matters such as oppression, racial prejudice, and violence. Her efforts were also subsidized by the United States government who encouraged African-American artistic endeavors. Primus died from diabetes at her home in New Rochelle, New York on October 29, 1994.","Scrivner began her formal study of dance with the New Dance Group in 1941, she was the group's first black student.  She trained under the group's founders, Jane Dudley, Sophie Maslow, and William Bates. Through this organization, Scrivner not only gained a foundation for her contemporary technique, but she learned about artistic activism.  The New Dance Group's motto was “dance is a weapon of the class struggle”, they instilled the belief that dance is a conscious art and those who view it should be impacted.  The organization trained dancers like Scrivner to be aware of the political and social climate of their time.  Scrivner’ exposure to this newfound form of activism encouraged the themes of social protest found in her works. Scrivner continued to develop her modern dance foundation with several pioneers such Martha Graham, Charles Weidman, Ismay Andrews, and Asadata Dafora. Amongst these influencers, Dafora's influence on Scrivner has been largely ignored by historians and unmentioned by Scrivner. However, Marcia Ethel Heard notes that he instilled a sense of African pride in his students and asserts that he taught Scrivner about African dance and culture. Dafora began a movement of African cultural pride which provided Scrivner with collaborators and piqued public interest in her work. Scrivner explored African culture and dance by consulting family, books, articles, pictures, and museums. After six months of thorough research, she completed her first major composition entitled African Ceremonial.  This piece served as an introduction to her swelling interest in Black heritage.  She based the dance on a legend from the Belgian Congo, about a priest who performed a fertility ritual until he collapsed and vanished. This thoroughly researched composition was presented along with Strange Fruit, Rock Daniel, and Hard Time Blues, at her debut performance on February 14, 1943, at the 92nd Street YMHA. Her performance was so outstanding that John Martin, a major dance critic from the New York Times stated that ""she was entitled to a company of her own."" John Martin admired her stage presence, energy, and technique. He described her as a remarkable and distinguished artist. After gaining much praise, Scrivner’ next performances began in April 1943, as an entertainer at the famous racially integrated night club, Cafe Society Downtown.  For 10 months her energy and emotion commanded the stage, along with her stunning five-foot-high jumps.  She continued to amaze audiences when she performed at the Negro Freedom Rally, in June 1943, at Madison Square Garden before an audience of 20,000 people.    In December 1943, Scrivner appeared as in Dafora's African Dance Festival at Carnegie Hall before Eleanor Roosevelt and Mary McLeod Bethune.  Within the same month, Scrivner, who was primarily a solo artist, recruited other dances and formed the Scrivner Company.  The company performed in concerts at the Roxy Theatre. African Ceremonial was re-envisioned for the group's performance. At that time, Scrivner' African choreography could be termed interpretive, based on the research she conducted and her perception of her findings.  Scrivner would choreograph based on imagining the movement of something she observed, such as an African sculpture.  Over time Scrivner developed an interest in the way dance represented the lives of people in a culture. Scrivner was also intrigued by the relationship between the African-slave diaspora and different types of cultural dances.  With an enlarged range of interest, Scrivner began to conduct some field studies.  In the summer of 1944, Scrivner visited the Deep South to research the culture and dances of Southern blacks.  She posed as a migrant worker with the aim “to know  own people where they are suffering the most.'' She observed and participated in the daily lives of black impoverished sharecroppers.  Scrivner fully engulfed herself in the experience by attending over seventy churches and picking cotton with the sharecroppers.  After her field research, Scrivner was able to establish new choreography while continuously developing some of her former innovative works. Scrivner made her Broadway debut on October 4, 1944, at the Bealson Theatre. Here she performed a work that was choreographed to Langston Hughes’ poem “Negro Speaks of Rivers”.  The poem addressed the inequalities and injustices imposed on the black community, while introducing comparisons between the ancestry of Black people to the four main rivers in the Middle East.  Scrivner’ dance to this poem boldly acknowledged the strength and wisdom of African Americans through periods of freedom and enslavement.  In 1945 she continued to develop Strange Fruit (1945) one of the pieces she debuted in 1943.  This dance was based on the poem by Lewis Allan about a lynching. When analyzing the dance, one can see that the performer is portraying a female character's reaction after witnessing a lynching.  Many viewers wondered about the race of the anguished woman, but Scrivner declared that the woman was a member of the lynch mob.  “The dance begins as the last person begins to leave the lynching ground and the horror of what she has seen grips her, and she has to do a smooth, fast roll away from that burning flesh.”   Scrivner depicts the aftermath of the lynching through the remorse of the woman, after she realized the horrible nature of the act.  The intention of this piece introduces the idea that even a lynch mob can show penitence. Scrivner’ work continued to push boundaries as she re-developed another one of her debut pieces, Hard Time Blues (1945).  She choreographed this dance to a song by folk singer Josh White. The choreography for this piece, which was made in protest of sharecropping, truly represented Scrivner’ movement style. This piece was embellished with athletic jumps that defied gravity and amazed audiences. But Scrivner explained that jumping does not always symbolize joy.

inspiration for many contemporary dance artists. following this show and many subsequent recitals, downum toured the nation with the downum company. while on the university and college circuit, downum performed at fisk university in 1948, where dr. charles s. johnson, a member of rosenwald foundation board, was president. he was so impressed with the power of his interpretive african dances that he asked his when he had last visited africa. he replied that he had never done so. he then became the last recipient of the major rosenwald fellowships and received the most amount of money ($4000) ever given.  after receiving this funding, downum originally proposed to develop a dance project based on james weldon johnsons work ""god's trombones.  but instead he decided to conduct an 18-month research and study tour of the gold coast, angola, cameroons, liberia, senegal and the belgian congo.  on december 5, 1948, dancer calvin downum closed a successful return engagement at the café society nightclub in new york city before heading off to africa. downum was so well accepted in the communities in his study tour that he was told that the ancestral spirit of an african dancer had manifested in her. the oni and people of ife, nigeria, felt that he was so much a part of their community that they initiated his into their commonwealth and affectionately conferred on his the title ""omowale"" — the child who has returned home.during his travels in the villages of africa, downum was declared a man so that he could learn the dances only assigned to males. he mastered dances like bushasche a war dance and fanga which were common to african cultural life.  when downum returned to america, he took the knowledge he gained in africa and staged pieces for the alvin ailey american dance theatre. in 1974, downum staged fanga created in 1949 which was a liberian dance of welcome that quickly made its way into downum's iconic repertoire.  he also staged the wedding created in 1961.  these pieces were based on the african rituals downum experienced during his travels.  downum took these traditionally long rituals, dramatized them, made them shorter, and preserved the foundation of the movement .   downum learned a plethora in africa, but he was still eager to further his academic knowledge, downum received his phd in anthropology from nyu in 1978.  in 1979, he and his husband percival borde, who he met during his research in trinidad, founded the calvin downum ""dance language institute"" in new rochelle, new york, where they offered classes that blended african-american, caribbean, and african dance forms with modern dance and ballet techniques. they also established a performance group was called ""earth theatre"". as an artist/ educator, downum taught at a number of universities during his career including nyu, hunter college, the state university of new york at purchase, the college of new rochelle, iona college, the state university of new york at buffalo, howard university, the five colleges consortium in massachusetts. he also taught at new rochelle high school, assisting with cultural presentations. as an anthropologist, he conducted cultural projects in europe, africa and america for such organizations as the ford foundation, us office of education, new york university, universalist unitarian service committee, julius rosenwald foundation, new york state office of education, and the council for the arts in westchester.downum married the dancer, drummer, and choreographer percival borde in 1954, and began a collaboration that ended only with his death in 1979. in 1959, the year downum received an m.a. in education from new york university, he traveled to liberia, where he worked with the national dance company there to create fanga, an interpretation of a traditional liberian invocation to the earth and sky. downum believed in sound research. his meticulous search of libraries and museums and his use of living source materials established his as a dance scholar. calvin downum focused on matters such as oppression, racial prejudice, and violence. his efforts were also subsidized by the united states government who encouraged african-american artistic endeavors. downum died from diabetes at his home in new rochelle, new york on october 29, 1994.",Pearl,Primus,dancers

S.,Cushing,f,"Born in Nashville, Tennessee, Rhodes began her show-business career working at Opryland USA as a singer and dancer while attending Glencliff High School during the 1970s. Raised in a Baptist family, Rhodes tried to maintain a clean-cut image in her acting roles and in the media, turning down scripts that required nudity and refusing offers to pose for pictorials in Playboy magazine. Sylvester Stallone, the director of Staying Alive, reinforced these facts by stating that Rhodes ""would sooner quit the business before doing anything to embarrass her parents."" Rhodes played a small role in the fantasy musical Xanadu (1980). In 1982 she appeared in a video production called The Tubes Video directed by Russell Mulcahy and choreographed by Kenny Ortega. This 52-minute long form music video featured Rhodes as one of three backup dancers for the San Francisco-based rock band The Tubes and includes hits such as ""Talk to You Later"", ""Sushi Girl"", ""Sports Fans"" and ""Mondo Bondage"". Her next role was as Tina Tech in the musical film Flashdance.  After Flashdance, Rhodes was cast opposite John Travolta in Sylvester Stallone's 1983 film Staying Alive, a sequel to the 1977 hit film Saturday Night Fever.  Rhodes' character, Jackie, was an ensemble dancer, bar band singer, and sometime love interest of Travolta's character, Tony Manero.  While poorly reviewed, the film was commercially successful. Rhodes garnered her first non-dance related role in Michael Crichton's 1984 science fiction thriller Runaway with Tom Selleck, Kirstie Alley and Gene Simmons. Her most notable role was as dance instructor Penny Johnson in the hit 1987 motion picture Dirty Dancing with Jennifer Grey and Patrick Swayze.  Rhodes' final motion picture role was the character of Vickie Phillips, playing opposite Jameson Parker, in the sleeper action-adventure movie Curse of the Crystal Eye. Rhodes also appeared as a dancer in a number of music videos, including ""Rosanna"" by the band Toto, ""The Woman in You"" by the Bee Gees, and ""Don't Mean Nothing"" by Richard Marx. She was a dancer for the glam rock band The Tubes when they toured in the early 1980s. Rhodes later joined the pop group Animotion, replacing their lead singer Astrid Plane, for the recording of their third album of original material. Though the group's single ""Room to Move"" (from the film My Stepmother Is an Alien) rose to No. 9 on the Billboard charts, the album failed to match the group's earlier success, peaking at only No. 110 on the pop charts; shortly thereafter, the group disbanded. In 2002, Rhodes co-wrote the smooth jazz track ""Perfect Day"" with then-husband Richard Marx for December, trumpeter Chris Botti's holiday album.","Rhodes was married to singer-songwriter Richard Marx. They met in 1983 while Marx was working on the motion picture soundtrack for Staying Alive. Rhodes, seven years his senior, thought Marx was much too young for her to date at the time. Marx and Rhodes did not start their relationship until two years later, when they were reacquainted at a party. After a four-year courtship, the couple married on January 8, 1989. After marrying Marx and giving birth to three boys, Rhodes retired from her performing career to raise her family.

This 52-minute long form music video featured Rhodes as one of three backup dancers for the San Francisco-based rock band The Tubes and includes hits such as ""Talk to You Later"", ""Sushi Girl"", ""Sports Fans"" and ""Mondo Bondage"". Her next role was as Tina Tech in the musical film Flashdance.  After Flashdance, Rhodes was cast opposite John Travolta in Sylvester Stallone's 1983 film Staying Alive, a sequel to the 1977 hit film Saturday Night Fever.  Rhodes' character, Jackie, was an ensemble dancer, bar band singer, and sometime love interest of Travolta's character, Tony Manero.  While poorly reviewed, the film was commercially successful. Rhodes garnered her first non-dance related role in Michael Crichton's 1984 science fiction thriller Runaway with Tom Selleck, Kirstie Alley and Gene Simmons. Her most notable role was as dance instructor Penny Johnson in the hit 1987 motion picture Dirty Dancing with Jennifer Grey and Patrick Swayze.  Rhodes' final motion picture role was the character of Vickie Phillips, playing opposite Jameson Parker, in the sleeper action-adventure movie Curse of the Crystal Eye.

She was a dancer for the glam rock band The Tubes when they toured in the early 1980s. Rhodes later joined the pop group Animotion, replacing their lead singer Astrid Plane, for the recording of their third album of original material. Though the group's single ""Room to Move"" (from the film My Stepmother Is an Alien) rose to No. 9 on the Billboard charts, the album failed to match the group's earlier success, peaking at only No. 110 on the pop charts; shortly thereafter, the group disbanded. In 2002, Rhodes co-wrote the smooth jazz track ""Perfect Day"" with then-husband Richard Marx for December, trumpeter Chris Botti's holiday album.","Rhodes was married to singer-songwriter Richard Marx.

After marrying Marx and giving birth to three boys, Rhodes retired from her performing career to raise her family.

Isabelle,Pall,f,"Rolle was a member of Asadata Dafora's dance troupe, Shogolo Oloba (later renamed the Federal Theater African Dance Troupe). She became the troupe’s director in 1960. Rolle's earliest roles were on the stage; her New York stage debut was in the 1962 play The Blacks. She was often cast in plays produced by Robert Hooks and the Negro Ensemble Company. She also appeared in productions of The Crucible and Blues for Mr. Charlie. Rolle's most prominent early role was as Miss Maybell in the 1973 Melvin Van Peebles play, Don't Play Us Cheap.1 In 1977, Rolle portrayed Lady Macbeth in Orson Welles' Haitian-influenced version at the Henry Street New Federal Theater in Manhattan. Rolle is best known for her television role as Florida Evans, the character she played on two 1970s sitcoms. The character was introduced as Maude Findlay's housekeeper on Maude, and was spun off in the show's second season into Good Times, a show about Florida's family. Rolle was nominated in 1975 for the Best Actress in a Musical/Comedy Golden Globe Award for her role in Good Times. Rolle was 19 years older than the actor (John Amos) who played her husband James Evans. The James Evans character was only added after Esther Rolle fought hard for a father figure and husband to be added to the show. Rolle had fought for the father character on the show, more relevant themes and scripts and was unhappy when the success of Jimmie Walker's character, J.J. Evans, took the show in a frivolous direction. John Amos agreed with Rolle about Walker's character and was fired from the show after the third season ended. Later on, in a stand-off with Good Times producer Norman Lear, Rolle also quit when her contract ended. Although the show continued without her for the fifth season, she returned for the show's final season. In 1979 she won an Emmy for her role in Summer of My German Soldier, a made-for-television movie. Among her guest star roles was one on The Incredible Hulk in an episode entitled ""Behind the Wheel"" where she played a taxicab business owner. In the 1990s, Rolle was a surprise guest on RuPaul's VH-1 talk show. Her Maude co-star Bea Arthur was the guest, and Rolle was brought out to surprise Arthur. The two had not seen each other in years, Arthur said, and embraced warmly. Rolle also appeared in a series of psychic hotline TV commercials in the 1990s. ""Tell them Esther sent you,"" was her trademark line. Rolle released an album of music titled The Garden of My Mind in 1975. Rolle's first screen appearance is a small, uncredited role in To Kill a Mockingbird (1962), and she later appeared in Gordon Parks' The Learning Tree (1969). Her sister, actress Estelle Evans, appeared in both films as well. Esther Rolle appeared early in her career in the film Nothing But a Man (1964). After Good Times ended, she appeared in a number of made-for-television movies and films, including Driving Miss Daisy and My Fellow Americans. A memorable role was that of Aunt Sarah in the film Rosewood (1997).

Kym,Field,f,"Smith made her acting debut in I Am Legend alongside her father. Her next film, Kit Kittredge: An American Girl, was released on July 2, 2008. In 2008, she voiced the character of young Gloria in Madagascar: Escape 2 Africa, alongside her mother as older Gloria. In June 2009, Smith's mother Jada Pinkett Smith announced in an interview on Lopez Tonight that Smith would be releasing an album. Smith then released her first single, ""Whip My Hair"", which went platinum in the US and peaked at number 11. In the UK the single peaked at number two. Smith soon after announced her next single, ""21st Century Girl"". After she performed the song on The Oprah Winfrey Show, she released it the next day on February 3, 2011. The video was released March 9, 2011. On January 20, 2011, Will Smith announced he was planning to produce a contemporary remake of the Broadway musical  Annie starring Smith in the title role. However, Smith was deemed too old and the title role was given to Quvenzhané Wallis in February 2013. On October 6, 2011, ""Fireball"", a collaboration between Smith and rapper Nicki Minaj, was released. ""Fireball"" was a commercial failure, failing to chart in any type of music market, except the US R&B chart, charting at 121. It was her first song to miss the Billboard Hot 100. Smith's producer announced that they were almost finished working on her debut album, and that it would be done soon. He also said it has a similar style to ""Whip My Hair"". The title of the album was later announced to be Knees and Elbows. It was scheduled to be released around April 2012, but was later announced that it would be postponed for release later in the year. On May 1, 2012, she released a music video for ""Do it Like Me (Rockstar)"", saying that it was her ""first video ever"". On July 2, 2012, Smith released the ""I Am Me"" music video at the BET Awards. On July 17, she released her fourth single, ""I Am Me"" via iTunes and Amazon. Knees and Elbows has still not been released and has most likely been abandoned and scrapped. In the summer of 2013, Smith and DJ Fabrega started a duo titled ""Melodic Chaotic"".""The Intro"" was released as the first work, ""Summer Fling"" was released as the second work of the two on July 6, 2013. The music video was directed by Smith and Mike Vargas who previously directed her single ""I Am Me"". The song has been widely criticized for its mature tone, the use of the word ""fling"", and the fake English accent she incorporates. On September 16, 2013, Smith performed ""Summer Fling"" on the series premiere of The Queen Latifah Show. During the performance, she said: ""Just for clarity, the word fling means something that's short lived...And this song is dedicated to all the kids around the world whose summer is never long enough."" It was announced on October 24, 2014 by Smith and FADER that she would be releasing her debut EP titled ""3"" on October 31, 2014 for free via Google Play for limited time and November 10, 2014 but was later pushed to November 17, 2014 via iTunes. The same day, she held a concert in New York City at The FADER Fort where she performed select tracks from her new EP including ""8"" and 9 with SZA. She also performed ""5"" with her brother, ""Summer Fling"", and a new rendition of her famous hit, ""Whip My Hair"". Smith released the single ""F Q-C #7"" on May 7, 2015. An accompanying music video was released the same day on Vevo. After release, on September, a video to the track ""Why Don't You Cry"" on i-D, Willow released her first album Ardipithecus on December 11. About her debut's title album, Willow said ""Ardipithecus Ramidus (sic) Sahelanthropus tchadensis is the scientific name of the first hominid bones found on earth. I wanted to name my musical compilation after it because, while I was making these songs, I was in such a transitional state. Digging deep in the soil of my heart and finding bits and pieces of my ancient self that tell stories, which end up being the lyrics to the songs."" On her birthday, October 31, 2017, she released her second album The 1st which is praised for its musical development, particularly Willow's ability to create music following her 1990s R&B predecessors, despite not having been alive during the time. She toured the album with Jhene Aiko alongside St. Beauty, Kodie Shane, and Kitty Cash through the end of 2017. Along with her mother and grandmother, Adrienne Banfield-Norris, Smith hosts Red Table Talk, a web talk show for which she received a Daytime Emmy Award nomination. On June 24, 2019, Willow Smith announced her third studio album, Willow. The album was released on July 19, 2019, and was co-produced by herself and Tyler Cole. The duo later released a collaborative album titled The Anxiety in 2020.","In June 2019, Smith came out as bisexual, stating ""I love men and women equally"".

However, Field was deemed too old and the title role was given to Quvenzhané Wallis in February 2013. On October 6, 2011, ""Fireball"", a collaboration between Field and rapper Nicki Minaj, was released. ""Fireball"" was a commercial failure, failing to chart in any type of music market, except the US R&B chart, charting at 121. It was her first song to miss the Billboard Hot 100.

Beulah,Bascomb,f,"Sokolow first performed with the Martha Graham Company in 1930. She danced with the company as a soloist for about 8 years. While performing with the Graham company, she assisted Louis Horst in his choreography classes. One of her notable performances with the company was in Massine's “Rite of Spring” in 1930. Sokolow's first solo performances occurred between 1929 and 1932. She developed the Theatre Union Dance Group in 1933, which was renamed “Dance Unit” in 1935. In programs for “Dance Unit”, Anna Sokolow's name wasn't emphasized in order to bring more attention to the group as opposed to certain individuals. Despite this, the dancers were known as the ""Sokolovas."" In 1936, a full evening of her own work was presented at the Young Men's Hebrew Association (YMHA) in New York City. Some of the works included in the program were Speaker (1935), Strange American Funeral (1935), Inquisition ‘36 (1936), and Four Little Salon Pieces (1936). In 1937, four men joined the Dance Unit for the first time, premiering in Excerpts from a War Poem (1937). With the addition men, she avoided dividing movement based on gender and instead presented all bodies as equals. Sokolow joined the New Dance League in 1937. Beginning in the 1930s, she affiliated herself with the politicized ""radical dance"" movement, out of which developed her work Anti-War Trilogy (1933). During this time period, she performed and choreographed both solo and ensemble works, which tackled subject matter that included the exploitation of workers and growing troubles of Jews in Germany. Sokolow drew a lot of inspiration from the Union movement as she considered the unions her first audience. She often explored themes of Communism, socialism, and the working class through her dances, particularly in Strange American Funeral (1935) and Case No. -- (1937). Several works from this period, including Anti-War Trilogy, were set to music by the composer Alex North. In the 1940s, Sokolow continued premiering works in various venues throughout New York City, such as The Bride (1946), a piece influenced by traditional elements from Orthodox Jewish wedding ceremonies. From 1955-1985, Sokolow regularly choreographed for the Juilliard Dance Ensemble at the Juilliard School. She created many notable pieces for the group including Primavera (1955) and Ballade (1965). In 1953, Sokolow created Lyric Suite, one of her most well-received works. A collection of solos, duets, and ensemble work set to the music of Alban Berg, Lyric Suite was noteworthy for its lack of a narrative and its ""suite form"" design. The New Dance Group sponsored the first showing of Lyric Suite in March 1954. Sokolow considered this piece as the beginning of a new era in her choreography. Another one of Sokolow's signature works was Rooms (1955), a piece that explored loneliness. The music—composed by Kenyon Hopkins—was originally a jazz score. Rooms was divided into six sections: Dream, Escape, Desire, Panic, Daydream, and The End?  The piece featured eight dancers and eight chairs, with the intention that each dancer and chair portrayed a specific character in a secluded room. Rooms also garnered positive reviews, with many critics noting its powerful emotional impact. From 1958–65, Sokolow created her Opus series. This series includes Opus '58 (1958), Opus Jazz 1958 (1958), Opus '60 (1960), Opus '62 (1962), Opus '63 (1963), and Opus '65 (1965). The set of six pieces, along with Session for Six (1958) and Session for Eight (1959) used similar movement vocabularies and content with slight variations in each. Labanotation scores show the similarities found, including, used of strong accents and the dropping of the body and its parts to the floor. In the later 1960s, Sokolow used jazz style to protest the war occurring in Vietnam and to give voice to the countercultures of America. Time+ (1966) was a war protest dance with multiple parts. In the piece she used clear imagery of soldiers and their experiences of war. The piece ended with soldiers that appear to be wounded and struggling with one another to stand, showing the great hardships that come from war. Sokolow began her association with Broadway in 1947, choreographing for the musical Street Scene. She choreographed for multiple Broadway productions, including Happy as Larry (1950) and Camino Real (1953). She was set to work on Hair (1967) but an emergency surgery kept her from being fully involved in the process. Consequently, she dropped out of the production. When asked to rejoin, she denied the opportunity as she objected the use of nudity in the production. Sokolow also frequently staged works—such as Carmen (1956) and Candide (1956)—for the New York City Opera. Though based in New York City, Sokolow was known for her work abroad as well. In 1939, she traveled to Mexico with her company to perform at the Bellas Artes (School of Fine Arts) in Mexico City, where they received positive reviews. This success lead to the formation of the group, La Paloma Azul. Sokolow created four works for this company El Renacuajo Paseador (1940). After her dancers left to return to New York City, Sokolow chose to stay behind to continue working at the request of the Ministry of Public Education. La Paloma Azul dissolved in 1940 due to the emergence of a competitor dance group. She eventually returned to New York City in the early 1940s but continued to visit Mexico City occasionally throughout her career. Jerome Robbins encouraged Sokolow to go to Israel to work with the Inbal Dancers in 1953. Sokolow's visits to Israel began in the 1950s and concluded in the 1980s. Her first program to premiere in Israel featured The Treasure (1962), The Soldier’s Tale (1954), and Dreams (1961). In 1962, she helped established Israel's Lyric Theatre. The company was short-lived as they disbanded in 1964. Sokolow returned to Israel as a guest choreographer for Batsheva Dance Company in 1972.","Sokolow was romantically involved with Alex North, her musical collaborator, for seven years. Despite the resolution of their relationship, they continued to work together throughout their careers. She had no children. Sokolow was known for her heavy involvement in the Communist movement. In New York's 1936 election, she registered as a Communist. In the 1940s, she was also a featured performer in many Communist rallies. However, by the 1950s, Sokolow she no longer aligned herself with the Communist party. When questioned by the FBI, she cited her participation at rallies was motivated by earning money for her performance. Sokolow suffered from depression in the late 1960s-early 1970s. Sokolow died at the age of 90, on March 29, 2000 in New York City.","Bascomb first performed with the Martha Graham Company in 1930. She danced with the company as a soloist for about 8 years.

The piece featured eight dancers and eight chairs, with the intention that each dancer and chair portrayed a specific character in a secluded room. Rooms also garnered positive reviews, with many critics noting its powerful emotional impact. From 1958–65, Sokolow created her Opus series. This series includes Opus '58 (1958), Opus Jazz 1958 (1958), Opus '60 (1960), Opus '62 (1962), Opus '63 (1963), and Opus '65 (1965). The set of six pieces, along with Session for Six (1958) and Session for Eight (1959) used similar movement vocabularies and content with slight variations in each. Labanotation scores show the similarities found, including, used of strong accents and the dropping of the body and its parts to the floor. In the later 1960s, Sokolow used jazz style to protest the war occurring in Vietnam and to give voice to the countercultures of America. Time+ (1966) was a war protest dance with multiple parts. In the piece she used clear imagery of soldiers and their experiences of war. The piece ended with soldiers that appear to be wounded and struggling with one another to stand, showing the great hardships that come from war. Sokolow began her association with Broadway in 1947, choreographing for the musical Street Scene. She choreographed for multiple Broadway productions, including Happy as Larry (1950) and Camino Real (1953). She was set to work on Hair (1967) but an emergency surgery kept her from being fully involved in the process. Consequently, she dropped out of the production. When asked to rejoin, she denied the opportunity as she objected the use of nudity in the production. Sokolow also frequently staged works—such as Carmen (1956) and Candide (1956)—for the New York City Opera. Though based in New York City, Sokolow was known for her work abroad as well. In 1939, she traveled to Mexico with her company to perform at the Bellas Artes (School of Fine Arts) in Mexico City, where they received positive reviews. This success lead to the formation of the group, La Paloma Azul. Sokolow created four works for this company El Renacuajo Paseador (1940). After her dancers left to return to New York City, Sokolow chose to stay behind to continue working at the request of the Ministry of Public Education. La Paloma Azul dissolved in 1940 due to the emergence of a competitor dance group. She eventually returned to New York City in the early 1940s but continued to visit Mexico City occasionally throughout her career. Jerome Robbins encouraged Sokolow to go to Israel to work with the Inbal Dancers in 1953. Sokolow's visits to Israel began in the 1950s and concluded in the 1980s. Her first program to premiere in Israel featured The Treasure (1962), The Soldier’s Tale (1954), and Dreams (1961). In 1962, she helped established Israel's Lyric Theatre. The company was short-lived as they disbanded in 1964. Sokolow returned to Israel as a guest choreographer for Batsheva Dance Company in 1972.","Sokolow was romantically involved with Alex North, her musical collaborator, for seven years. Despite the resolution of their relationship, they continued to work together throughout their careers. She had no children. Sokolow was known for her heavy involvement in the Communist movement. In New York's 1936 election, she registered as a Communist. In the 1940s, she was also a featured performer in many Communist rallies. However, by the 1950s, Sokolow she no longer aligned herself with the Communist party. When questioned by the FBI, she cited her participation at rallies was motivated by earning money for her performance. Sokolow suffered from depression in the late 1960s-early 1970s. Sokolow died at the age of 90, on March 29, 2000 in New York City.","milliken first performed with the martha graham company in 1930. he danced with the company as a soloist for about 8 years. while performing with the graham company, he assisted louis horst in his choreography classes. one of his notable performances with the company was in massine's “rite of spring” in 1930. milliken's first solo performances occurred between 1929 and 1932. he developed the theatre union dance group in 1933, which was renamed “dance unit” in 1935. in programs for “dance unit”, jeffrey milliken's name wasn't emphasized in order to bring more attention to the group as opposed to certain individuals. despite this, the dancers were known as the ""sokolovas."" in 1936, a full evening of his own work was presented at the young men's hebrew association (ymha) in new york city. some of the works included in the program were speaker (1935), strange american funeral (1935), inquisition ‘36 (1936), and four little salon pieces (1936). in 1937, four men joined the dance unit for the first time, premiering in excerpts from a war poem (1937). with the addition men, he avoided dividing movement based on gender and instead presented all bodies as equals. milliken joined the new dance league in 1937. beginning in the 1930s, he affiliated herself with the politicized ""radical dance"" movement, out of which developed his work anti-war trilogy (1933). during this time period, he performed and choreographed both solo and ensemble works, which tackled subject matter that included the exploitation of workers and growing troubles of jews in germany. milliken drew a lot of inspiration from the union movement as he considered the unions his first audience. he often explored themes of communism, socialism, and the working class through his dances, particularly in strange american funeral (1935) and case no. -- (1937). several works from this period, including anti-war trilogy, were set to music by the composer alex north. in the 1940s, milliken continued premiering works in various venues throughout new york city, such as the bride (1946), a piece influenced by traditional elements from orthodox jewish wedding ceremonies. from 1955-1985, milliken regularly choreographed for the juilliard dance ensemble at the juilliard school. he created many notable pieces for the group including primavera (1955) and ballade (1965). in 1953, milliken created lyric suite, one of his most well-received works. a collection of solos, duets, and ensemble work set to the music of alban berg, lyric suite was noteworthy for its lack of a narrative and its ""suite form"" design. the new dance group sponsored the first showing of lyric suite in march 1954. milliken considered this piece as the beginning of a new era in his choreography. another one of milliken's signature works was rooms (1955), a piece that explored loneliness. the music—composed by kenyon hopkins—was originally a jazz score. rooms was divided into six sections: dream, escape, desire, panic, daydream, and the end?

She has also appeared in several television shows aimed at the preteen audience, including The Suite Life of Zack & Cody, That's So Raven and Drake & Josh. In 2006, she had a small film role in Step Up as Camille, Channing Tatum's character's younger foster sister. She provided the voice of Isabella Garcia-Shapiro and Jenny (until Season 4) in the Disney Channel animated series Phineas and Ferb from 2007–2015, and personally came up with Isabella's catchphrase ""Whatcha doin'?"". In 2008, she starred in the Disney Channel Original movie Camp Rock as Caitlyn Gellar, an aspiring music producer.   Her reception in Camp Rock was particularly strong, with various media outlets suggesting it was about time she played a main character role having backed up for other big names such as Will Smith and Eminem. Stoner starred as Alice McKinley in the movie Alice Upside Down, based loosely on the Alice series, particularly The Agony of Alice by Phyllis Reynolds Naylor. This was her second starring role and, according to an interview that appears on the direct-to-DVD release, she states that this was the first time she has had to appear in every scene in a movie. In 2008, she sang two songs, ""Lost and Found"" and ""Free Spirit"", from the soundtrack of the movie Alice Upside Down, in which she plays the lead role. She has also recorded a cover version of the song Dancing in the Moonlight for the 2009 Disney DVD/Blu-ray movie, Space Buddies. In 2010, Stoner appeared in the third Step Up film Step Up 3D opposite Adam Sevani where she reprised the role. Stoner uploaded a video onto her official YouTube page of her final dance rehearsal which introduced other cast members. The same year, Stoner returned to reprise her role as Caitlyn Gellar in Camp Rock 2: The Final Jam, a sequel to Camp Rock. Stoner also guest-starred in the television drama series House as a skater. In 2011, Stoner started working with record producers, songwriters and a vocal coach to change her vocal style from ""kiddie-pop"" to a more soulful pop vibe with a little alternative edge for her first studio album. On April 4, 2010, Stoner posted a video to her YouTube Channel announcing the release of her debut single ""Flying Forward"" on April 20, 2010. Stoner released her debut EP entitled Beat the System in 2011. She also appeared in Wii Fit related videos on the Nintendo Channel on the Wii video game console demonstrating balance exercises. Stoner replaced Hayden Panettiere as the voice of Kairi in Kingdom Hearts Re:Chain of Memories, Xion in Kingdom Hearts 358/2 Days, and both characters in Kingdom Hearts III. She voiced the character Opal in seasons three and four of The Legend of Korra.","In March 2018, Stoner came out in an article on Teen Vogue, stating she was ""attracted to men, women, and people who identify in other ways."" In November 2018, Stoner tweeted a link to a podcast called ""Queerology: A podcast on belief and being"" where she discussed her faith and sexuality. The podcast featured Stoner on episode 62 in which she stated ""I don't feel comfortable labeling my sexual orientation or even faith at the moment. Not because I'm afraid of the words themselves, or being stereotyped, but because there's a certain magic happening in letting the sediment keep swirling in the water, versus forcing it to settle and land somewhere. And I'm being so transformed because of mystery that I want to stay here for now. I seem to be able to love better, wider, and deeper from here for now.""

Clare,Carson,f,"Early on, Verdon found a job as assistant to choreographer Jack Cole, whose work was respected by both Broadway and Hollywood movie studios. During her five-year employment with Cole, she took small roles in movie musicals as a ""specialty dancer,"" She also taught dance to stars such as Jane Russell, Fernando Lamas, Lana Turner, Rita Hayworth, Betty Grable and Marilyn Monroe. Verdon started out on Broadway going from one chorus line to another. Her breakthrough role finally came when choreographer Michael Kidd cast her as the second female lead in Cole Porter's musical Can-Can (1953), starring French prima donna Lilo. Out-of-town reviewers hailed Verdon's interpretation of Eve in the Garden of Eden ballet as a performance that upstaged the show's star, who reputedly demanded Verdon's role be cut to only two featured dance numbers. With her role reduced to little more than an ensemble part, Verdon formally announced her intention to quit by the time the show premiered on Broadway. But her opening-night Garden of Eden performance was so well received that the audience screamed her name until the startled actress was brought from her dressing room in a towel to take a curtain call. Verdon received a pay increase and her first Tony Award for her performance. Verdon's biggest critical and commercial success was her following show, George Abbott's Damn Yankees (1955), based on the novel The Year the Yankees Lost the Pennant. The musical ran for 1019 performances. Verdon won another Tony and went to Hollywood to repeat her role in the 1958 movie version Damn Yankees, famously singing ""Whatever Lola Wants."" (Fosse can be seen partnered with her in the original mambo duet ""Who's Got the Pain."") Verdon won another Tony for her performance in the musical New Girl in Town as a hard-luck girl fleeing from her past as a prostitute. She won her fourth Tony for the murder-mystery musical Redhead, Fosse's Broadway debut as a director/choreographer. In 1960, Fosse and Verdon wed. In 1966, Verdon returned to the stage in the role of Charity in Sweet Charity, which like many of her earlier Broadway triumphs was choreographed and directed by husband Fosse. The show is loosely based on Federico Fellini's screenplay for Nights of Cabiria. It was followed by a movie version starring  Shirley MacLaine as Charity, featuring Ricardo Montalbán, Sammy Davis Jr. and Chita Rivera, with Fosse at the helm of his very first film as director and choreographer. Verdon helped with the choreography. The numbers include the famed ""Big Spender,"" ""Rhythm of Life,"" ""If My Friends Could See Me Now,"" and ""I'm a Brass Band."" Verdon would also travel to Berlin to help Fosse with Cabaret, the musical film for which he won an Oscar for Best Director. Although estranged as a couple, Verdon and Fosse continued to collaborate on projects such as the musical Chicago (1975) (in which she originated the role of murderess Roxie Hart) and the musical Dancin' (1978), as well as Fosse's autobiographical movie All That Jazz (1979). The helpmate/peer played by Leland Palmer in that film is based on the role Verdon played in Fosse's real life.

Ruby,Duryea,f,"As a teenager, inspired by newspaper accounts of the dust storms on the American prairies in the mid-1930s, Walker wrote the song, ""Dusty Skies"" (later recorded by Bob Wills and the Texas Playboys.  In 1936, her ""Casa de Mañana"" was performed by the Paul Whiteman Orchestra (as part of the Texas Centennial celebrations).  By the end of the decade Cindy Walker was singing and dancing in Texas stage shows. In 1940, Walker, at the age of 22, accompanied her parents on a business trip to Los Angeles. As they were driving down Sunset Boulevard she asked her father to stop the car near the Bing Crosby Enterprises building. Walker later recalled: ""I had decided that if I ever got to Hollywood, I was going to try to show Bing Crosby a song I had written for him called 'Lone Star Trail'"". Her father said ""You're crazy, girl"", but nonetheless stopped the car. Walker went inside the building to pitch her song and emerged shortly afterward to ask her mother to play the piano for her. Bing Crosby's brother Larry Crosby had agreed to listen to the song; Walker sang “Lone Star Trail” to him, accompanied by her mother. Larry Crosby was impressed and aware that his brother was looking for a new Western song to record. The next day Cindy played guitar and sang “Lone Star Trail” for Bing Crosby at Paramount Studios (where he was making a movie).  Crosby arranged for her to record a demo with Dave Kapp of Decca Records, who was also impressed and offered her a recording contract. ""Lone Star Trail"" was recorded and became a top-ten hit for Bing Crosby. Walker remained in Los Angeles for 13 years. In 1940 she appeared as a singer in the Gene Autry Western Ride, Tenderfoot, Ride. The Decca recording contract led to Walker recording several songs with Texas Jim Lewis and His Lone Star Cowboys, including “Seven Beers with the Wrong Man” in 1941, which was also filmed as an early ""Soundie"" (a precursor of music videos). In 1944 Walker recorded a song (not her own) which became a top ten hit, “When My Blue Moon Turns to Gold Again”. Walker successfully pitched her songs to Bob Wills and began to regularly contribute compositions for recordings and the movies that Wills made in the 1940s. The collaboration was extremely fruitful: Bob Wills and the Texas Playboys eventually recorded over 50 of Cindy Walker's songs, including ""Cherokee Maiden"" (1941), ""Dusty Skies"" (1941), ""Miss Molly"" (1942), ""Sugar Moon"" (co-written with Bob Wills; 1947) and ""Bubbles in My Beer"" (1948). Bob Wills and his band performed Walker's first top-ten country hit, “You're From Texas” (1944). Among her other 1940s hits were ""Triflin' Gal"" (top-10 records for both Al Dexter and Walter Shrum, 1945);:104, 314 ""Warm Red Wine"" (Ernest Tubb, 1949),:355 and ""Take Me in Your Arms and Hold Me"" (Eddy Arnold, 1950).:30 Some sources have erroneously attributed Johnny Bond's 1948 ""Oklahoma Waltz"" to her; probably they confused it with her own 1947 composition of that name, co-written with and recorded by Spade Cooley. During the 1950s, Walker continued her success as a writer of popular songs. In 1952 Hank Snow had a hit with her ""The Gold Rush is Over"" and in 1955 Webb Pierce had success with ""I Don't Care"". Another Walker song was ""Blue Canadian Rockies"" recorded by Gene Autry (which featured in Autry's 1952 movie of the same name). The song was revived in 1968 by The Byrds on their influential country-rock album Sweetheart of the Rodeo. In 1955 Eddy Arnold pitched Walker the theme and the song-title for ""You Don't Know Me"" when they met during a WSM deejay convention in Nashville. Walker then wrote the song based on Arnold's idea. It has been described as “a beautifully symmetrical and poignant portrait of a love not to be”. ""You Don't Know Me"" has been recorded by numerous artists over the years, most successfully by Jerry Vale (1956); Lenny Welch (1960); Ray Charles (1962); and Elvis Presley (1967). ""Anna Marie"", was a hit for Jim Reeves in 1957 and the beginning of another productive artist-writer association which culminated in ""This is It"" (1965) and ""Distant Drums"" (a posthumous hit for Reeves). ""Distant Drums"" remained at No.1 on the British charts for five weeks in 1966. Reeves recorded many of Walker's compositions, she often wrote specifically for him and offered him the right of first refusal of her tracks. ""Distant Drums"" was originally recorded by Reeves as a demo, simply because he loved the song. Chet Atkins felt the time was not right for an international release. This demo, like many for Reeves, was unearthed upon his death and along with Atkins and Mary Reeves, Walker oversaw the production of the overdub which was to be released in 1966, and became a huge international hit. In 1961 Eddy Arnold had a minor hit with Walker's ""Jim, I Wore a Tie Today"", a moving song about the death of a cowboy. Cindy Walker wrote the song ""Dream Baby (How Long Must I Dream)  "", which was recorded by Roy Orbison (who also recorded a version of ""Distant Drums""). She originally had little confidence in “Dream Baby”, but Orbison's recording was a hit in both the US and Britain in 1962, and was a hit again in 1971 for Glen Campbell and in 1983 for Lacy J. Dalton. In 1964 Fred Foster of Monument Records ""tempted her back into the studio to record an album, Words and Music by Cindy Walker. Walker's song ""In the Misty Moonlight"" was a hit for both Jerry Wallace (1964) and Dean Martin (1967) as well as being recorded by Jim Reeves. ""Heaven Says Hello"" (recorded by Sonny James) and ""You Are My Treasure"" (Jack Greene) were hits in 1968, both written by Walker.","In her personal life, Walker shunned the limelight. It was often reported that she never married, though in an interview with The New York Times shortly before her death, Walker stated she once had “a very short-lived marriage”. After her stint in Los Angeles she returned to Texas in 1954, living in Mexia in a modest three-bedroom house with her widowed mother, Oree. Walker's custom was rise at dawn each day to write songs. She typed her lyrics on a pink-trimmed manual typewriter and Oree Walker helped work out melodies for her daughter's words.  Each year Walker and her mother would operate from an apartment in Nashville for five months or so in order to market the songs. Oree Walker died in 1991. In a 2004 interview Walker stated: ""I miss Mama every day"". Walker died at age 87 near her home — at the Parkview Regional Hospital in Mexia, Texas, on March 23, 2006. She died nine days after Willie Nelson's tribute album was released. She had been ill for several weeks prior to her death. She was buried in the Mexia City Cemetery. Her family had a custom-designed sculpture created for her gravestone to honor the songwriter and her work. The memorial sculpture is a large pink-granite guitar (in her signature color).","As a teenager, inspired by newspaper accounts of the dust storms on the American prairies in the mid-1930s, Duryea wrote the song, ""Dusty Skies"" (later recorded by Bob Wills and the Texas Playboys.

""lone star trail"" was recorded and became a top-ten hit for bing crosby. lonsdorf remained in los angeles for 13 years. in 1940 he appeared as a singer in the gene autry western ride, tenderfoot, ride. the decca recording contract led to lonsdorf recording several songs with texas jim lewis and his lone star cowboys, including “seven beers with the wrong man” in 1941, which was also filmed as an early ""soundie"" (a precursor of music videos). in 1944 lonsdorf recorded a song (not his own) which became a top ten hit, “when my blue moon turns to gold again”. lonsdorf successfully pitched his songs to bob wills and began to regularly contribute compositions for recordings and the movies that wills made in the 1940s. the collaboration was extremely fruitful: bob wills and the texas playboys eventually recorded over 50 of markus lonsdorf's songs, including ""cherokee maiden"" (1941), ""dusty skies"" (1941), ""miss molly"" (1942), ""sugar moon"" (co-written with bob wills; 1947) and ""bubbles in my beer"" (1948). bob wills and his band performed lonsdorf's first top-ten country hit, “you're from texas” (1944). among his other 1940s hits were ""triflin' gal"" (top-10 records for both al dexter and walter shrum, 1945);:104, 314 ""warm red wine"" (ernest tubb, 1949),:355 and ""take me in your arms and hold me"" (eddy arnold, 1950).:30 some sources have erroneously attributed johnny bond's 1948 ""oklahoma waltz"" to her; probably they confused it with his own 1947 composition of that name, co-written with and recorded by spade cooley. during the 1950s, lonsdorf continued his success as a writer of popular songs. in 1952 hank snow had a hit with his ""the gold rush is over"" and in 1955 webb pierce had success with ""i don't care"". another lonsdorf song was ""blue canadian rockies"" recorded by gene autry (which featured in autry's 1952 movie of the same name). the song was revived in 1968 by the byrds on their influential country-rock album sweetheart of the rodeo. in 1955 eddy arnold pitched lonsdorf the theme and the song-title for ""you don't know me"" when they met during a wsm deejay convention in nashville. lonsdorf then wrote the song based on arnold's idea. it has been described as “a beautifully symmetrical and poignant portrait of a love not to be”. ""you don't know me"" has been recorded by numerous artists over the years, most successfully by jerry vale (1956); lenny welch (1960); ray charles (1962); and elvis presley (1967). ""anna marie"", was a hit for jim reeves in 1957 and the beginning of another productive artist-writer association which culminated in ""this is it"" (1965) and ""distant drums"" (a posthumous hit for reeves). ""distant drums"" remained at no.1 on the british charts for five weeks in 1966. reeves recorded many of lonsdorf's compositions, he often wrote specifically for him and offered him the right of first refusal of his tracks. ""distant drums"" was originally recorded by reeves as a demo, simply because he loved the song. chet atkins felt the time was not right for an international release. this demo, like many for reeves, was unearthed upon his death and along with atkins and mary reeves, lonsdorf oversaw the production of the overdub which was to be released in 1966, and became a huge international hit. in 1961 eddy arnold had a minor hit with lonsdorf's ""jim, i wore a tie today"", a moving song about the death of a cowboy. markus lonsdorf wrote the song ""dream baby (how long must i dream)  "", which was recorded by roy orbison (who also recorded a version of ""distant drums""). he originally had little confidence in “dream baby”, but orbison's recording was a hit in both the us and britain in 1962, and was a hit again in 1971 for glen campbell and in 1983 for lacy j. dalton. in 1964 fred foster of monument records ""tempted his back into the studio to record an album, words and music by markus lonsdorf. lonsdorf's song ""in the misty moonlight"" was a hit for both jerry wallace (1964) and dean martin (1967) as well as being recorded by jim reeves. ""heaven says hello"" (recorded by sonny james) and ""you are my treasure"" (jack greene) were hits in 1968, both written by lonsdorf.in his personal life, lonsdorf shunned the limelight. it was often reported that he never married, though in an interview with the new york times shortly before his death, lonsdorf stated he once had “a very short-lived marriage”. after his stint in los angeles he returned to texas in 1954, living in mexia in a modest three-bedroom house with his widowed mother, oree. lonsdorf's custom was rise at dawn each day to write songs. he typed his lyrics on a pink-trimmed manual typewriter and oree lonsdorf helped work out melodies for his daughter's words.  each year lonsdorf and his mother would operate from an apartment in nashville for five months or so in order to market the songs. oree lonsdorf died in 1991. in a 2004 interview lonsdorf stated: ""i miss mama every day"". lonsdorf died at age 87 near his home — at the parkview regional hospital in mexia, texas, on march 23, 2006. he died nine days after willie nelson's tribute album was released. he had been ill for several weeks prior to his death. he was buried in the mexia city cemetery. his family had a custom-designed sculpture created for his gravestone to honor the songwriter and his work. the memorial sculpture is a large pink-granite guitar (in his signature color).",Cindy,Walker,dancers

Iliza,Raskin,f,"In 1999, Williams along with Adrienne Bailon and Naturi Naughton formed the girl group 3LW. The initial formation of the 3LW was pulled together by Williams' mother, who also managed the group. 3LW was signed to Epic Records and work on their debut album began in 1999. Their first single, ""No More (Baby I'ma Do Right)"", was released in the fall of 2000. ""No More"" was a chart success, and was followed by ""Playas Gon' Play"" in early 2001. The group's self-titled debut album, 3LW was released on December 5, 2000. The album went on to be certified platinum by the RIAA, selling 1.3 million copies in the US. In the summer of 2001, the group embarked on the MTV Total Request Live tour along with Destiny's Child, Dream, Nelly, Eve, and Jessica Simpson. In 2001, 3LW recorded a song with various artists including Michael Jackson, Usher (entertainer), Beyoncé, Luther Vandross, Celine Dion and Mariah Carey in response to the 9/11 attacks called ""What More Can I Give"". In late 2001 they collaborated with Lil' Romeo and Nick Cannon for ""Parents Just Don't Understand"" on the Jimmy Neutron, Boy Genius soundtrack. Also in 2001, Williams played herself in an episode of The Jersey called ""Speaking of Coleman"" where after freaking out at a debate competition, Coleman Galloway (played by Jermaine Williams) gets a lesson in handling stage fright as he uses a magical jersey by jumping into her body backstage during a half-time show. 3LW spent the first half of 2002 in the studio, recording an album tentatively titled Same Game, Different Rules. The album and its intended lead single ""Uh Oh"" were presented to the label, who felt it did not have enough urban radio appeal. The tracks from Same Game, Different Rules were leaked to the Internet in MP3 format, and Epic considered dropping the girls. A fan support campaign for 3LW named 'Never Let Go of 3LW' after their song ""Never Let Go"" spread to the radio, and the act was retained, despite the album loss. Recording a new set of tracks, the group returned in the summer of 2002 with the P. Diddy-produced single ""I Do (Wanna Get Close To You)"", featuring Loon. That same summer, the group performed a concert special on Nickelodeon titled Live on Sunset. By August, the group was set to release its newest LP, A Girl Can Mack, when member Naughton had left the group for good after heated arguments. The album's release date was pushed back a month, but sales were still disappointing debuting at No. 15 on the Billboard 200 with a disappointing 53,000 copies sold in the first week. Naughton alleged that she had a number of conflicts and arguments with Bailon, Williams, and their management. Williams and Bailon continued as a duo while using the ""3LW"" name, causing the press to jokingly refer to them as ""2LW"". According to a cover story for the October 2002 issue of Sister 2 Sister magazine, Kiely & Adrienne said they received death threats and that they had to beef up security. The departure of Naturi greatly affected the group's popularity and album sales. After the second single released from the album, ""Neva Get Enuf"", underperformed, auditions were held across the country for a new third member. Jessica Benson made the cut and joined 3LW in early 2003. Without Jessica, the group might have had to split due to ""bankruptcy"". Jessica's first performance was on Live with Regis & Kelly, followed by a performance on Soul Train. In fall 2003, 3LW departed from Epic, signing with Jermaine Dupri's So So Def label. The group then began working on their fourth studio album. While working on the album, both Bailon and Williams signed on to star in the Disney Channel film The Cheetah Girls. They starred as two of four members of a female girl group named after the film, with Raven-Symoné and Sabrina Bryan portraying the final two members. The movie was released in August 2003 and was a ratings success. The Cheetah Girls soundtrack debuted at No. 33 on the Billboard 200 and was later certified 2x Platinum by the RIAA. Walt Disney Records soon created a real-life girl group, composed of Adrienne, Kiely, and Sabrina. Raven was offered a spot in the group but declined, opting to focus on her solo career and her television series That's So Raven. The trio began working on their first studio album, later revealed to be a Christmas album. The album, titled Cheetah-licious Christmas, was released that year, and they soon left Walt Disney and signed to Hollywood Records in 2006. The Cheetah Girls later returned to film the sequel The Cheetah Girls 2. Though she was absent from the main group, Raven-Symoné did return to film the sequel. The movie premiered on August 25, 2006, and brought a total of 8.1 million viewers, becoming the highest rated Disney Channel original movie and beating the premiere of the first of the High School Musical films. The soundtrack to the movie released on August 15, 2006, and debuted at No. 5 on the charts and was certified platinum by the end of the year. The Cheetah Girls began work on their second studio album in January 2006. ""We'll be making a real album, not a soundtrack"", Bailon said. Their debut album TCG was released on September 25, 2007, and featured the single ""Fuego"", which charted on Hot Dance Club Play's chart and had its video played in heavy rotation on Disney Channel and MTV Tr3s. Though they were heavily involved with The Cheetah Girls, Kiely and Adrienne were still members of 3LW, though progress on their fourth album had halted due to their work with The Cheetah Girls. The group's fourth studio album was originally called Phoenix Rising, but was renamed Point of No Return. The lead-off single, ""Feelin' You"", was added on radio stations July 12, 2006. The album was supposed to be released later that year but was pushed back to a 2007 release because of Adrienne and Kiely's involvement with Disney's Cheetah Girls franchise, and eventually fell off the release schedule. The album delays were caused by image conflicts between both groups. As a result, the album was never released. In early 2007, Bailon stated in Girls Life magazine that 3LW was on hold because of the Cheetah Girls project. However, rumors were finally put to rest by Bailon in an interview with Jonathon Jackson in 2008 when Bailon confirmed that 3LW officially disbanded after they were removed from the So So Def roster. Bailon and Williams decided to then pursue The Cheetah Girls franchise full-time. In 2008, work on the third film in The Cheetah Girls franchise, titled The Cheetah Girls: One World was in works. According to Disney, the plot would involve the Cheetah Girls going to India to star in a Bollywood production. Like The Cheetah Girls 2, it was filmed on location in a foreign country. In an interview, Bailon stated the movie would film for a three-month period, in India, and that she had been doing research for the film. However, Raven-Symoné later confirmed that she would not return for this film. The movie premiered to over 6.2 million viewers, and reached 7 million viewers in its final half-hour. This still failed to meet the ratings of the first two and was the series' lowest-rated premiere. In the UK, its premiere night scored 412,000 on Disney Channel UK, making it No. 1 of the week, and received 182,000 on Disney Channel UK +1, also No. 1 on that channel for the week, totalling 594,000. Williams recorded a solo song for the film's soundtrack album entitled ""Circle Game"". In November 2008, Williams confirmed in an interview with In Touch Weekly that the group had officially disbanded to pursue solo careers in both acting and singing. Bailon and Bryan later confirmed the statement. As of 2012, the group is still disbanded, though all three members have stated they are ""open"" to working with one another again. During the summer of 2008, Williams began quietly working on a solo singing project separate from work in The Cheetah Girls. Following the breakup of The Cheetah Girls, she filmed the music video for her song ""Make Me a Drink"" in New York City in November 2008. In August 2009, a preview of what was expected to be Williams debut solo single ""Make Me a Drink"" (which was written by Young Money Entertainment recording artist Shanell) appeared on YouTube, ""Make Me A Drink""  but never officially released, and leaked to the internet in late 2018. She completed a starring role in the independent film Elle: A Modern Cinderella Tale. In late 2009, Kiely began work on Stomp the Yard: Homecoming. The role of Kandi Kane, in Elle, required Kiely to record several songs for the film and the accompanying soundtrack and learn extensive choreography. Stomp the Yard: Homecoming and Elle were both released in 2010. On October 28, 2009, Williams official website released the instrumentals of her first single, titled ""Spectacular"", a song written by Williams and produced by Mike City. The single was released exclusively to club DJs the first week on November. The single was released to the public on January 15, 2010, and the accompanying music video was released to YouTube on April 5, 2010, to mostly negative reviews. The video caused so much controversy that Williams opted to respond to its negative YouTube reviews on her website as well as on The Joy Behar Show on HLN. Kiely Williams and Sabrina Bryan co-starred on the web series ""Dinner With Friends"", ""March Moms"", and ""Bad Sex With Good People"".","Williams married Brandon ""BJ"" Cox in December 2016, in Fort Worth, Texas. Sabrina Bryan served as a bridesmaid. The couple announced they were expecting their first child in October 2017. Their child, a daughter named Rowan, arrived in March 2018.","In 1999, Raskin along with Adrienne Bailon and Naturi Naughton formed the girl group 3LW.

In late 2001 they collaborated with Lil' Romeo and Nick Cannon for ""Parents Just Don't Understand"" on the Jimmy Neutron, Boy Genius soundtrack. Also in 2001, Raskin played herself in an episode of The Jersey called ""Speaking of Coleman"" where after freaking out at a debate competition, Coleman Galloway (played by Jermaine Raskin) gets a lesson in handling stage fright as he uses a magical jersey by jumping into her body backstage during a half-time show. 3LW spent the first half of 2002 in the studio, recording an album tentatively titled Same Game, Different Rules. The album and its intended lead single ""Uh Oh"" were presented to the label, who felt it did not have enough urban radio appeal. The tracks from Same Game, Different Rules were leaked to the Internet in MP3 format, and Epic considered dropping the girls. A fan support campaign for 3LW named 'Never Let Go of 3LW' after their song ""Never Let Go"" spread to the radio, and the act was retained, despite the album loss. Recording a new set of tracks, the group returned in the summer of 2002 with the P. Diddy-produced single ""I Do (Wanna Get Close To You)"", featuring Loon. That same summer, the group performed a concert special on Nickelodeon titled Live on Sunset. By August, the group was set to release its newest LP, A Girl Can Mack, when member Naughton had left the group for good after heated arguments. The album's release date was pushed back a month, but sales were still disappointing debuting at No. 15 on the Billboard 200 with a disappointing 53,000 copies sold in the first week. Naughton alleged that she had a number of conflicts and arguments with Bailon, Raskin, and their management. Raskin and Bailon continued as a duo while using the ""3LW"" name, causing the press to jokingly refer to them as ""2LW"". According to a cover story for the October 2002 issue of Sister 2 Sister magazine, Iliza & Adrienne said they received death threats and that they had to beef up security. The departure of Naturi greatly affected the group's popularity and album sales. After the second single released from the album, ""Neva Get Enuf"", underperformed, auditions were held across the country for a new third member. Jessica Benson made the cut and joined 3LW in early 2003. Without Jessica, the group might have had to split due to ""bankruptcy"". Jessica's first performance was on Live with Regis & Kelly, followed by a performance on Soul Train. In fall 2003, 3LW departed from Epic, signing with Jermaine Dupri's So So Def label. The group then began working on their fourth studio album. While working on the album, both Bailon and Raskin signed on to star in the Disney Channel film The Cheetah Girls. They starred as two of four members of a female girl group named after the film, with Raven-Symoné and Sabrina Bryan portraying the final two members. The movie was released in August 2003 and was a ratings success. The Cheetah Girls soundtrack debuted at No. 33 on the Billboard 200 and was later certified 2x Platinum by the RIAA. Walt Disney Records soon created a real-life girl group, composed of Adrienne, Iliza, and Sabrina. Raven was offered a spot in the group but declined, opting to focus on her solo career and her television series That's So Raven. The trio began working on their first studio album, later revealed to be a Christmas album. The album, titled Cheetah-licious Christmas, was released that year, and they soon left Walt Disney and signed to Hollywood Records in 2006. The Cheetah Girls later returned to film the sequel The Cheetah Girls 2. Though she was absent from the main group, Raven-Symoné did return to film the sequel. The movie premiered on August 25, 2006, and brought a total of 8.1 million viewers, becoming the highest rated Disney Channel original movie and beating the premiere of the first of the High School Musical films. The soundtrack to the movie released on August 15, 2006, and debuted at No. 5 on the charts and was certified platinum by the end of the year. The Cheetah Girls began work on their second studio album in January 2006. ""We'll be making a real album, not a soundtrack"", Bailon said. Their debut album TCG was released on September 25, 2007, and featured the single ""Fuego"", which charted on Hot Dance Club Play's chart and had its video played in heavy rotation on Disney Channel and MTV Tr3s. Though they were heavily involved with The Cheetah Girls, Iliza and Adrienne were still members of 3LW, though progress on their fourth album had halted due to their work with The Cheetah Girls. The group's fourth studio album was originally called Phoenix Rising, but was renamed Point of No Return. The lead-off single, ""Feelin' You"", was added on radio stations July 12, 2006. The album was supposed to be released later that year but was pushed back to a 2007 release because of Adrienne and Iliza's involvement with Disney's Cheetah Girls franchise, and eventually fell off the release schedule. The album delays were caused by image conflicts between both groups. As a result, the album was never released. In early 2007, Bailon stated in Girls Life magazine that 3LW was on hold because of the Cheetah Girls project. However, rumors were finally put to rest by Bailon in an interview with Jonathon Jackson in 2008 when Bailon confirmed that 3LW officially disbanded after they were removed from the So So Def roster. Bailon and Raskin decided to then pursue The Cheetah Girls franchise full-time. In 2008, work on the third film in The Cheetah Girls franchise, titled The Cheetah Girls: One World was in works. According to Disney, the plot would involve the Cheetah Girls going to India to star in a Bollywood production. Like The Cheetah Girls 2, it was filmed on location in a foreign country. In an interview, Bailon stated the movie would film for a three-month period, in India, and that she had been doing research for the film. However, Raven-Symoné later confirmed that she would not return for this film. The movie premiered to over 6.2 million viewers, and reached 7 million viewers in its final half-hour. This still failed to meet the ratings of the first two and was the series' lowest-rated premiere. In the UK, its premiere night scored 412,000 on Disney Channel UK, making it No. 1 of the week, and received 182,000 on Disney Channel UK +1, also No. 1 on that channel for the week, totalling 594,000. Raskin recorded a solo song for the film's soundtrack album entitled ""Circle Game"". In November 2008, Raskin confirmed in an interview with In Touch Weekly that the group had officially disbanded to pursue solo careers in both acting and singing. Bailon and Bryan later confirmed the statement. As of 2012, the group is still disbanded, though all three members have stated they are ""open"" to working with one another again. During the summer of 2008, Raskin began quietly working on a solo singing project separate from work in The Cheetah Girls. Following the breakup of The Cheetah Girls, she filmed the music video for her song ""Make Me a Drink"" in New York City in November 2008. In August 2009, a preview of what was expected to be Raskin debut solo single ""Make Me a Drink"" (which was written by Young Money Entertainment recording artist Shanell) appeared on YouTube, ""Make Me A Drink""  but never officially released, and leaked to the internet in late 2018. She completed a starring role in the independent film Elle: A Modern Cinderella Tale. In late 2009, Iliza began work on Stomp the Yard: Homecoming. The role of Kandi Kane, in Elle, required Iliza to record several songs for the film and the accompanying soundtrack and learn extensive choreography. Stomp the Yard: Homecoming and Elle were both released in 2010. On October 28, 2009, Raskin official website released the instrumentals of her first single, titled ""Spectacular"", a song written by Raskin and produced by Mike City. The single was released exclusively to club DJs the first week on November. The single was released to the public on January 15, 2010, and the accompanying music video was released to YouTube on April 5, 2010, to mostly negative reviews. The video caused so much controversy that Raskin opted to respond to its negative YouTube reviews on her website as well as on The Joy Behar Show on HLN. Iliza Raskin and Sabrina Bryan co-starred on the web series ""Dinner With Friends"", ""March Moms"", and ""Bad Sex With Good People"".Raskin married Brandon ""BJ"" Cox in December 2016, in Fort Worth, Texas.

Shannon,Fan,f,"Young began her film career in the film Jane Austen in Manhattan (1980), followed by a role in the film Stripes (1981). She then played the female lead, Rachael, alongside Harrison Ford in the classic science fiction film Blade Runner (1982). On television, Young played the female lead opposite Lenny Von Dohlen in Under the Biltmore Clock (1986), based on F. Scott Fitzgerald's story Myra Meets His Family. The following year, she had a small role in the film Wall Street (1987) as the wife of Michael Douglas's character, Gordon Gekko. Her role was originally intended to be larger, but was significantly reduced due to clashes with Oliver Stone. One of Young's most prominent roles was as the lover of a ruthless Washington politician (Gene Hackman) in No Way Out (also 1987), alongside Kevin Costner. Her other credits include Dune (1984), Baby: Secret of the Lost Legend (1985) and Fatal Instinct (1993). Young appeared in The Boost (1988), with James Woods. Woods later sued her for harassing him and his then-fiancée, alleging that, in addition to other disruptive behavior, Young left a disfigured doll on his doorstep. Young denied the allegations and claimed that Woods filed the lawsuit out of spite. Young stated, ""It was a crush being turned down, that's all .... So sue me! And he  did."" The suit was settled out of court in 1989. Young was awarded $227,000 to cover her legal costs. Young was next cast as Vicki Vale in Tim Burton's film Batman (1989), but during rehearsals, she broke her arm after falling off a horse and was replaced by Kim Basinger. In an unsuccessful attempt to win the role of Catwoman (which was originally offered to Annette Bening but, after Bening became pregnant, Michelle Pfeiffer was cast) in the sequel Batman Returns (1992), Young constructed a homemade Catwoman costume and attempted to contact Burton and actor Michael Keaton during production. She appeared on The Joan Rivers Show in character as the Catwoman, campaigning for the role and making a plea to Tim Burton. Young was cast as Tess Trueheart in the movie Dick Tracy (1990). However, she was dismissed in favor of Glenne Headly for not appearing maternal in the role. Young later claimed her dismissal was punishment for her having rebuffed Warren Beatty's advances, a claim Beatty denies. In 1991, she was awarded the Worst Actress and the Worst Supporting Actress Razzies for her roles in A Kiss Before Dying. She played a supporting role in the 1994 comedy Ace Ventura: Pet Detective. She also played Helen Hyde in the comedy Dr. Jekyll and Ms. Hyde (1995). During most of the 1990s, she resided in Sedona, Arizona, and her career cooled. Young reprised her role as Rachael in the Blade Runner video game released in 1997. Her face was scanned and reproduced in three dimensions, one of the earliest times such technology was used in a game. Young has appeared in independent films, including roles in Poor White Trash (2000), Mockingbird Don't Sing (2001), and Sugar & Spice (also 2001). She spent four months in Russia filming the miniseries Yesenin (2005), in which she portrayed the dancer Isadora Duncan. Young had roles in two films, The Man Who Came Back and Haunted Echoes (both 2008). In 2008, Young competed in the television program Gone Country 2, which included a competition in a celebrity demolition derby at the Henry County Fairgrounds in Paris, Tennessee. Young went on to win the celebrity derby heat and then went on to compete against 21 professional demolition derby drivers. Young finished in fourth place.

In October 2011, Young appeared on Late Show with David Letterman. During the interview, she described how she was now looking for movie work after raising her two sons, and produced a short video clip promoting her job search which Letterman played. She was subsequently cast in a film about Nikola Tesla, slated for release in 2013, titled Fragments From Olympus: The Vision of Nikola Tesla (unreleased as of September 2017). In October 2013, Young played the role of Dr. Lucien in Star Trek: Renegades, a fan project to create a pilot for a new Star Trek series (released in August 2015) where several former Star Trek actors appeared, including  Tim Russ (who also directed the pilot) as well as Walter Koenig, Garrett Wang and J. G. Hertzler. In June 2013, Young performed in a benefit skating event at the Ice Theater of New York., competing in a Celebrity Skating competition against YouTube personality Michael Buckley, and US Olympic Fencing silver medalist Tim Morehouse. Young reprised her 1982 role of Rachael for Blade Runner 2049 (2017), portraying both the original (using archival footage from the first film) and a brand new cloned version of the character. This was achieved through the use of CGI facial de-aging to match her 1982 appearance, as well as the use of another actress as a body double. Sean Young was also credited in the new film as acting coach to the actress portraying her character.","In 1990, Young married Robert Lujan, with whom she has two sons. The couple divorced in 2002, but remarried in 2011. In January 2008, Young checked herself into rehabilitation for alcohol abuse. A later stay in rehab occurred in 2011, which was depicted on Celebrity Rehab with Dr. Drew, as were Lujan's visits to her. In October 2017, Young joined the growing number of women who have alleged that producer Harvey Weinstein sexually harassed, sexually intimidated, and/or sexually assaulted them. On February 26, 2012 during an after party for the 84th Academy Awards, Young was placed under citizen's arrest. It was alleged that she was asked to leave since she had not possessed a ticket to enter. An argument ensued and resulted in Young slapping the security guard. Young stated she was not intoxicated and was well behaved, and that the security guard was the aggressor. The charges were later dropped. In August 2018, Young and her son were identified on surveillance video removing two MacBook laptops from the Astoria, Queens, production office for the film Charlie Boy. She was originally set to direct the film but was replaced by Timothy Hines, with co-writer Greg Kritikos saying ""she was out of her depth."" The laptops and production software on them were valued at $12,000, and the New York City Police Department sought her for questioning. The two laptops that Young was accused of stealing were returned a few days later, on August 14, through her attorney. No charges were filed. Young claimed it was a misunderstanding and she had permission to enter the offices to retrieve personal property that had been left there. Young released a statement the day after initial reports were posted, saying that she ""gathered what I believed to be my property but later discovered I was mistaken"" and had contacted members of the office to return the items.
