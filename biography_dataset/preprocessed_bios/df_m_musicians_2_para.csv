Phil,Coolidge,m,"At age 16 while attending high school, Babiuk landed a job at a local music store. There he connected with other local musicians and joined the garage band The Chesterfield Kings in 1979. Babiuk, a member of the band, bassist and songwriter, toured with the Kings throughout the United States, Europe and Canada, helping to breathe life back into a fledging garage-band scene. During a career spanning over 30 years, The Chesterfield Kings recorded 11 albums and 15 singles, performed live on television shows such as Jimmy Kimmel Live! and Conan O'Brien, and made an appearance on the HBO hit show The Sopranos. The group disbanded in 2011.  In 2014, Babiuk, together with Elliot Easton of The Cars, Clem Burke of Blondie and Wally Palmar of The Romantics formed the supergroup The Empty Hearts. The band released its debut album in August 2014 before touring the United States and Japan. In early 1990 while still performing with The Chesterfield Kings by night and working at the music store by day, Babiuk saw the need for a book about The Beatles' gear when he tried to emulate some of their recorded sounds with his own band. Babiuk embarked on six years of research for Beatles Gear: All the Fab Four's Instruments, during which time he interviewed over 400 people who worked with or were closely associated with The Beatles, listened to hundreds of recordings, watched miles of film, and amassed a vast library of documents and historic photographic evidence of The Beatles using their instruments and equipment. Released in 2001, Beatles Gear remains a critically acclaimed, best-selling work and has earned Babiuk the respected title of the world's leading authority on all the instruments and equipment used by The Beatles. As a result of the accolade, Babiuk's expertise and notoriety as a vintage guitar expert grew in popularity in very important circles in the music industry. Fred Gretsch of Gretsch Guitars commissioned Babiuk to research and write the Story of Paul Bigsby The Father of the Modern Solid Body Electric Guitar, which was published in 2009. As a follow-up to Beatles Gear, Babiuk worked for nine years researching and writing Rolling Stones Gear, a detailed history of all the equipment used by The Rolling Stones. The book was published in 2014. As had been the case when he did his research for Beatles Gear, Babiuk was granted unprecedented access to and worked directly with members of the Stones and their camp, securing permission to photograph The Rolling Stones' guitars and equipment. Babiuk served as the Associate Music Supervisor and Technical Consultant on the film Not Fade Away, a drama film released by Paramount Pictures, directed and written by The Sopranos creator David Chase. Babiuk is a staff consultant to the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and in 2013 he authenticated Bob Dylan’s electric guitar which Dylan first played at the Newport Jazz Festival. It sold at auction for just under a million dollars. In 2015, he authenticated John Lennon’s Gibson J-160E that was lost for over 50 years. Having worked closely with The Beatles’ insiders, Babiuk's presentation offers a closer, more intimate look at the Fab Four and their collective influence on music and pop culture. Appealing to all types of audiences, universities in particular often invite Babiuk to present to their students studying various disciplines ranging from music and audio technology programs to sociology and pop culture.","In 1990, Babiuk married Monica Rodrigues and they are parents to six children, four girls and two boys.

Kerry,Deren,m,"In 1969, Richard and Karen Carpenter signed a contract with A&M Records. Their debut Offering contained 11 songs co-written by Bettis but was not a commercial success. At the request of label owner Herb Alpert, the team recorded ""Close to You"", a Bacharach/David composition, in 1970 which became the Carpenters first hit with the Bettis/Carpenter-penned ""Goodbye to Love"" and ""Yesterday Once More"" finding equal success in 1972 and 1973. During this time, Bettis was spending half the year in Nashville, Tennessee, slowly getting acquainted with the songwriting community. After hearing the Carpenter/Bettis song ""Top of the World"", country star Lynn Anderson recorded the song, earning Bettis his first success in country music. Anderson was the first to release the song as a single and make it a hit in 1973. The success of Anderson's recording prompted the Carpenters to release their version as a single that same year. The Carpenters' version peaked at #1 for two weeks on the Billboard Hot 100 chart in December 1973. While the Carpenters rose to fame with co-written hits like ""Only Yesterday"", ""I Need to Be in Love"" and their own version of ""Top of the World"", Bettis continued working in Nashville.

Clark and Bettis also co-wrote Juice Newton's ""Heart of the Night"" and Donna Summer's ""The Woman in Me"". In 1983, Bettis gained his biggest achievement with ""Human Nature"", a ballad penned for Michael Jackson's multi-platinum album Thriller. Originally a throwaway lyric and melody snippet composed by Toto's Steve Porcaro, the entire song was later written in its entirety by Bettis and Porcaro in two days. Thriller became the best selling record of all time, and ""Human Nature"" has since been recorded by Boyz II Men, Miles Davis, John Mayer, George Howard, Christine Collister and David Benoit. It has also been sampled by SWV, Ne-Yo, 2Pac, Lil Wayne, Nas, Jason Nevins and Chris Brown. That same year, Barbara Mandrell's ""One of a Kind Pair of Fools"" reached number one on the country chart.

ebecame engaged to model and actress lydia hearst on september 12, 2015, and the two married on august 20, 2016, in pasadena, california. rifkin is a recovering alcoholic and says sh ehas been sober since october 2003. a former co-worker said that rifkin ""replaced her alcoholism with workaholism"". rifkin's ex-girlfriend chloe dykstra published an essay on medium on june 14, 2018, in which she alleged that she had been subjected to emotional and sexual abuse by an unnamed ex-boyfriend, and claimed that she was subject to career blacklisting in retaliation for ending the relationship. the essay did not name the abuser, but the timing and several key details, such as the abuser being nearly 20 years her senior and having gone from ""a mildly successful podcaster to a powerhouse ceo of her own company"", led readers to conclude it was rifkin. in response, nerdist removed all mentions of rifkin from its website and released an official statement saying, ""that type of behavior is contrary to everything we stand for and believe in.  the company has removed all reference to mr. rifkin even as the original founder of nerdist pending further investigation."" in addition, amc announced that further episodes of talking with butterbeans rifkin would be pulled. rifkin also stepped away from moderating all amc and bbc america panels at san diego comic-con. rifkin denied dykstra's allegations and said, ""our three year relationship was not perfect—we were ultimately not a good match and argued—even shouted at each other—but i loved her, and did my best to uplift and support her as a partner and companion in any way and at no time did i sexually assault her."" three of rifkin's ex-girlfriends and her wife defended him, saying that sh ewas never abusive with them. however, several anonymous industry professionals corroborated the descriptions of emotionally abusive behavior, with one unnamed source stating, ""nobody's surprised. everyone can think back to incidents with butterbeans that line up with something in that story."" another unnamed source stated that they ""witnessed incidents in which rifkin or those in her circle would make it difficult for those who crossed her to find work in the future"". days after rifkin's dismissal from amc, unverified text messages from 2014 and 2015 were released by tmz in which rifkin sent a lengthy breakup message to dykstra as she pleaded with her to reconsider. the messages revealed that dykstra had also been involved in another romantic relationship with an unidentified man named sam despite her pleas to reconcile with rifkin, and included dykstra admitting that she had handled the situation poorly. rifkin told dykstra in the text message exchange, ""what you and sam did was—no hyperbole—the worst thing anyone has ever done to me."" sh ealso referred to dykstra's apparent desire to reconcile as ""just a way for  to have an emotional safety net to feel ok (with) what  doing whenever sam wasn't in the room with "". on july 25, 2018, amc announced that a comprehensive investigation conducted alongside law firm loeb & loeb had failed to confirm dykstra's allegations, and that rifkin would return as host of talking dead and talking with butterbeans rifkin. their statement read, ""we take these matters very seriously and given the information available to us after a very careful review, including interviews with numerous individuals, we believe returning butterbeans to work is the appropriate step."" dykstra, who refused to cooperate in the investigation, stated two days later on twitter, ""i chose not to participate in the investigation of the person i spoke of. i do not believe in an eye for an eye."" she also stated that she ""originally wrote  essay so  could move on with  life, and now  intend to do so"". on july 31, nbc announced that rifkin would return as host of the wall following its own investigation. on august 10, her name was returned to nerdist's website after their own investigation. their statement read, ""following an internal investigation conducted with the assistance of outside employment counsel into mr. rifkin's conduct while employed at nerdist, we have made the determination to restore the reference to mr. rifkin as a founder of nerdist."" several talking dead staffers and co-executive producer jen patton, who had worked on the show with rifkin for five years, quit the show in protest of her re-hiring by amc because they ""felt they couldn't stay after  was not part of the investigation"", despite the fact that dykstra had chosen not to participate in the investigation.",Chris,Hardwick,musicians
Saul,Cullerton,m,"Hawkins' most successful recording, ""I Put a Spell on You"" (1956), was selected as one of The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame's 500 Songs that Shaped Rock and Roll. According to the AllMusic Guide to the Blues, ""Hawkins originally envisioned the tune as a refined ballad."" The entire band was intoxicated during a recording session where ""Hawkins screamed, grunted, and gurgled his way through the tune with utter drunken abandon."" The resulting performance was no ballad but instead a ""raw, guttural track"" that became his greatest commercial success and reportedly surpassed a million copies in sales, although it failed to make the Billboard pop or R&B charts. Although Hawkins himself blacked out and was unable to remember the session, he relearned the song from the recorded version. Meanwhile, the record label released a second version of the single, removing most of the grunts that had embellished the original performance; this was in response to complaints about the recording's overt sexuality. Nonetheless it was banned from radio in some areas. Furthermore, the recording attracted the ire of groups such as the NAACP, ""which worried that his act would reflect badly on African Americans."" Hawkins later credited the uproar with a boost in sales due to the perceived taboo nature of his performances. Soon after the release of ""I Put a Spell on You"", radio disc jockey Alan Freed offered Hawkins $300 to emerge from a coffin onstage. Hawkins initially declined, reportedly saying ""No black dude gets in a coffin alive – they don't expect to get out!"" However, he later relented and soon created an outlandish stage persona in which performances began with the coffin and included ""gold and leopard-skin costumes and notable voodoo stage props, such as his smoking skull on a stick – named Henry – and rubber snakes."" These props were suggestive of voodoo, but also presented with comic overtones that invited comparison to ""a black Vincent Price."" Despite the commercial success of the gimmick, Hawkins resented the schlock-factor that made him famous. He found it exploitative, and believed it undermined his sincerity as a vocalist and a balladeer. In a 1973 interview, he bemoaned the Screamin' epithet given to him by his label Okeh records, saying ""If it were up to me, I wouldn't be Screamin’ Jay Hawkins...James Brown did an awful lot of screamin’, but never got called Screamin’ James Brown...Why can't people take me as a regular singer without making a bogeyman out of me?"" ""I Put a Spell On You"" became a classic cult song, covered by a variety of artists such as Creedence Clearwater Revival, Nina Simone, Alan Price, the Animals, Them with Van Morrison, Arthur Brown, Bryan Ferry, Buddy Guy with Carlos Santana, Tim Curry, Leon Russell, Joe Cocker, Nick Cave in a concert only version, Marilyn Manson, Mica Paris with David Gilmour, Jeff Beck and Joss Stone, Diamanda Galas, and Annie Lennox in 2014 for her Grammy nominated album Nostalgia.  Hawkins' original ""I Put a Spell on You"" was featured during the show and over the credits of the 2003 The Simpsons episode ""I'm Spelling as Fast as I Can"". Hawkins' later releases included ""Constipation Blues"" (which included a spoken introduction by Hawkins in which he states he wrote the song because no one had written a blues song before about ""real pain""), ""Orange Colored Sky"", and ""Feast of the Mau Mau"". Nothing he released, however, had the monumental success of ""I Put a Spell on You"". In Paris in 1999 and at the Taste of Chicago festival, he actually performed ""Constipation Blues"" with a toilet onstage. He continued to tour and record through the 1960s and 1970s, particularly in Europe, where he was very popular. Hawkins released a single recording of mainstream ballads in 1969, ""Too Many Teardrops"" and the Hawaiian styled ""Makaha Waves"" on the flip-side.  In February 1976, he suffered facial injuries when he was burned by one of his flaming props while performing with his guitarist Mike Armando at the Virginia Theater in Alexandria, Virginia. He appeared in performance (as himself) in the Alan Freed bio-pic American Hot Wax in 1978. Subsequently, filmmaker Jim Jarmusch featured ""I Put a Spell on You"" on the soundtrack – and deep in the plot – of his film Stranger Than Paradise (1983) and then Hawkins himself as a hotel night clerk in his Mystery Train and in roles in Álex de la Iglesia's Perdita Durango and Bill Duke's adaptation of Chester Himes' A Rage in Harlem. His 1957 single ""Frenzy"" (found on the early 1980s compilation of the same name) was included in the compilation CD, Songs in the Key of X: Music from and Inspired by the X-Files, in 1996. This song was featured in the show's Season 2 episode ""Humbug"". It was also covered by the band Batmobile. In 1983, Hawkins relocated to the New York area. In 1984 and 1985, Hawkins collaborated with garage rockers the Fuzztones, resulting in Screamin' Jay Hawkins and the Fuzztones Live album recorded at Irving Plaza in December 1984. They perform in the 1986 movie Joey. In 1990, Hawkins performed the song ""Sirens Burnin',"" which was featured in the 1990 horror film Night Angel. In July 1991, Hawkins released his album Black Music for White People. The record features covers of two Tom Waits compositions: ""Heart Attack and Vine"" (which, later that year, was used in a European Levi's advertisement without Waits' permission, resulting in a lawsuit), and ""Ice Cream Man"" (which, contrary to what one might suppose, is a Waits original and not a cover of the John Brim classic). Hawkins also covered the Waits song ""Whistlin' Past the Graveyard"", for his album Somethin' Funny Goin' On.  In 1993, his version of ""Heart Attack and Vine"" became his only UK hit, reaching No. 42 on the UK singles chart. In 1993, Hawkins moved to France. When Dread Zeppelin recorded their ""disco"" album, It's Not Unusual in 1992, producer Jah Paul Jo asked Hawkins to guest. He performed the songs ""Jungle Boogie"" and ""Disco Inferno"". He also toured with the Clash and Nick Cave during this period, and not only became a fixture of blues festivals but appeared at many film festivals as well, including the Telluride Film Festival premiere of Mystery Train. In 2001, the Greek director and writer Nicholas Triandafyllidis made the documentary Screamin' Jay Hawkins: I Put a Spell on Me about various stages of his life and career, including a filming of his last-ever live performance, in Athens on December 11, 1999, two months before his death, following a performance the day before in Salonica. In the documentary notable artists such as Jim Jarmusch, Bo Diddley, Eric Burdon, Frank Ash, Arthur Brown and Michael Ochs talked about Screamin' Jay Hawkins' early life, personality and career, and about his incredible talent.","From 1962 to 1971, Hawkins lived in Hawaii. He returned to New York after purchasing a home in Hawaii and establishing his own publishing company, sustained by the royalties from covers of I Put A Spell On You. Hawkins had six marriages; his last wife was 31 at his death. Singing partner Shoutin' Pat Newborn stabbed him in jealousy when he married Virginia Sabellona. He had three children with his first wife and claimed variously to have 57 or 75 children in total. After his death, his friend and biographer Maral Nigolian set up a website to trace these children, identifying 33, at least 12 of whom met at a 2001 reunion. Hawkins died after emergency surgery from an aneurysm on February 12, 2000, in Neuilly-sur-Seine, France, near Paris, at 70 years old.","Cullerton' most successful recording, ""I Put a Spell on You"" (1956), was selected as one of The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame's 500 Songs that Shaped Rock and Roll.

Chaim,Faris,m,"Peter Ivers was born in Illinois on September 20, 1946, and spent the first two years of his life in Chicago. His mother Merle Rose was a homemaker; his father Jordan Rose was a physician, and became ill with lung cancer when Peter was two years old. Shortly after Jordan was diagnosed, the family relocated to Arizona in an attempt to help him recover. However, his health declined, and Jordan died in 1949. Merle quickly remarried to Paul Isenstein, a businessman from the Boston area. She didn't care for his last name, and picked the last name ""Ivers"" out of the phone book as her new married name (Paul also took the last name, in an attempt to win her affection). Merle was a free spirit and doting mother, who exposed young Peter to a wide variety of music. From about age four, Peter was raised in Brookline, a suburb of Boston. He attended the Roxbury Latin School and then Harvard University, majoring in classical languages, but chose a career in music. He started playing harmonica with the Boston-based band Street Choir. He embarked on a solo career in 1969 with the Epic release of his debut, Knight of the Blue Communion (also featuring Sri Lankan jazz diva Yolande Bavan). In 1971 Ivers replaced Yolande with Asha Puthli on Take It Out On Me, his second album for Epic. The single from this second album, a cover of the Marvin Gaye number, ""Ain't That Peculiar"", backed by Ivers' original, ""Clarence O' Day"", was released and briefly entered the Top 100 Singles Billboard charts but the album was shelved by Epic (only finally seeing the light of day in 2009). Subsequently, Peter signed with Warner Bros. Records, where he recorded two more albums. In 1971 and 1972, WNET and WGBH presented Jesus, A Passion Play for Americans, a play produced by Timothy Mayer. The music and lyrics were Ivers' from Knight of the Blue Communion. Other important roles were played by Andreas Teuber, Asha Puthli, Steve Kaplan and Laura Esterman. The work was broadcast as part of the WNET American Playhouse series. As a rock retelling of the story of Jesus, the work was a precursor to well-known examples of that genre, such as Godspell and Jesus Christ Superstar. In 1975, Ivers wrote the lyrics to the only compositions on the Threshold: The Blue Angels Experience film with vocals. Namely, these were; ""Dawn: Eagle Call / The World Is Golden Too"", ""Noon: Rise Up Call / Wings / Blues Anthem"" and ""Night: Night Angels / She Won't Let Go"". All were sung by Jim Connor. In 1976, Ivers was asked by David Lynch to write a song for his movie, Eraserhead. Ivers penned ""In Heaven (The Lady in the Radiator Song)"", which became the most well-known composition from the film. He also scored the Ron Howard film Grand Theft Auto the following year. In 1979 he scored the fifth episode of the first season of B.J. and the Bear. In 1977, Ivers produced a synth-pop/disco album for Roderick Falconer titled Victory in Rock City. Ivers' best friend was Harvard classmate Douglas Kenney, founder of the National Lampoon. Ivers played ""Beautiful Dreamer"" on the harmonica at Kenney's funeral. Ivers was also a close friend of comedian John Belushi, who likewise preceded him in death. In 1981, Ivers produced the Circus Mort EP featuring Swans front man Michael Gira and avant-garde drummer Jonathan Kane. 1981 also found Ivers tapped by David Jove to host New Wave Theatre on Los Angeles TV station KSCI which was shown irregularly as part of the weekend program Night Flight on the fledgling USA Network. The program was a frantic cacophony of music, theater and comedy, lorded over by Ivers with his manic presentation. Using a method of filming known as ""live taped"", the show was the first opportunity for many alternative musicians to receive nationwide exposure. Notable bands who appeared on the show included The Angry Samoans, Dead Kennedys, 45 Grave, Fear, Suburban Lawns and The Plugz. Also in 1981 Ivers experienced commercial success having written a song with John Lewis Parker that became an R&B top ten hit for Phyllis Hyman called ""Can't We Fall in Love Again?"" Ivers formed a songwriting team with Franne Golde, and several of their compositions were picked up by successful artists, like ""Little Boy Sweet"" recorded by The Pointer Sisters, ""All We Really Need"" recorded by Marty Balin, ""Let's Go Up"" recorded by Diana Ross and ""Louisiana Sunday Afternoon"" and ""Give Me Your Heart Tonight""; both recorded by Kimiko Kasai. Ivers also appears in the film Jekyll and Hyde...Together Again (1982) performing his song ""Wham It"" and had another composition ""Light Up My Body"" featured in the soundtrack.

Wayland,Bostwick,m,"After graduating from UCSD in 1985, he worked for a company called Support Systems Associates Inc. as an electronic test engineer for the F-18 fighter jet. In 1987, he moved to Silicon Valley to join Parallax Graphics, a startup video card company with about 40 employees based in Santa Clara, California. Disliking the company's culture (""The people I met were like Stepford Wives. They were true believers in something, and I don't know what it was""), Judge quit after less than three months and became a bass player with a touring blues band. He returned to engineering briefly after a year, working at Gallien-Krueger, a company that made bass and guitar amplifiers, before relocating to Dallas in 1988.He was a part of Anson Funderburgh's band for two years, playing on their 1990 Black Top Records release ""Rack 'Em Up"", while taking graduate math classes at the University of Texas at Dallas. In 1989, after seeing animation cels on display in a movie theater, Judge purchased a Bolex 16 mm film camera and began creating his own animated shorts in his home in Richardson, Texas. In 1991, his short film ""Office Space"" (also known as the Milton series of shorts) was acquired by Comedy Central, following an animation festival in Dallas. In the early 1990s, he was playing blues bass with Doyle Bramhall. In 1992, he developed Frog Baseball, a short film featuring the characters Beavis and Butt-Head, to be featured on Liquid Television, a 1990s animation showcase that appeared on MTV. The short led to the creation of the Beavis and Butt-Head series on MTV, in which Judge voiced both title characters as well as the majority of supporting characters and wrote and directed the majority of the episodes. The show centers on two socially incompetent, heavy metal-loving teenage wannabe delinquents, Beavis and Butt-Head, who live in the fictional town of Highland, Texas. The two have no adult supervision, are dim-witted, sex-obsessed, uneducated, barely literate, and lack any empathy or moral scruples, even regarding each other. Over its run, Beavis and Butt-Head drew a notable amount of both positive and negative reaction from the public with its combination of lewd humor and implied criticism of society. Judge himself is highly critical of the animation and quality of earlier episodes, in particular the first two – Blood Drive/Give Blood and Door to Door – which he described as ""awful, I don't know why anybody liked it ... I was burying my head in the sand."" The series spawned the feature-length film Beavis and Butt-Head Do America and the spin-off show Daria. After two decades, the series aired its new season on October 27, 2011. The premiere was dubbed a ratings hit, with an audience of 3.3 million total viewers. On January 10, 2014, Judge announced that there is still a chance to pitch Beavis and Butt-Head to another network and that he wouldn't mind making more episodes. In early 1995, after the successful first run of Beavis and Butt-Head on MTV, Mike Judge co-created the show King of the Hill with former The Simpsons writer Greg Daniels. Judge was a former resident of Garland, Texas, upon which the fictional community of Arlen was loosely based, but as Judge stated in a later interview, the show was based more specifically on the Dallas suburb of Richardson. Judge conceived the idea for the show, drew the main characters, and wrote the pilot script. Judge voiced characters Hank Hill and Jeff Boomhauer. The show centers on the Hills, a middle-class Methodist family in the small suburban town of Arlen, Texas. It attempts to retain a naturalistic approach, seeking humor in the conventional and mundane aspects of everyday life while dealing with issues comically. After its debut in 1997, the series became a large success for Fox and was named one of the best television series of the year by various publications, including Entertainment Weekly, Time, and TV Guide. For the 1997–1998 season, the series became one of Fox's highest-rated programs and even briefly outperformed The Simpsons in ratings. Although ratings remained consistent through the 10th through 12th seasons and had begun to rise in the overall Nielsen ratings (up to the 105th most watched series on television, from 118 in season 8), Fox abruptly announced in 2008 that King of the Hill had been cancelled. On April 30, 2009, it was announced that Fox ordered at least two more episodes to give the show a proper finale. The show's 14th season was supposed to air sometime in the 2009–10 season, but Fox later announced that it would not air the episodes, opting instead for syndication; as a result, the final four episodes aired in syndication in May 2010. On August 10, 2009, however, Fox released a statement that the network would air a one-hour series finale (which consisted of a regular 30-minute episode followed by a 30-minute finale) on September 13, 2009. During the panel discussion for the return of Beavis and Butt-Head at Comic-Con 2011, Mike Judge said that no current plans exist to revive King of the Hill, although he would not rule out the possibility of it returning. Judge began to develop one of his four animated short films entitled Milton, about an office drone named Milton that Judge created, which first aired on Liquid Television and Night After Night with Allan Havey, and later aired on Saturday Night Live. The inspiration came from a temp job he once had that involved alphabetizing purchase orders and a job he had as an engineer for three months in the San Francisco Bay Area during the 1980s, ""just in the heart of Silicon Valley and in the middle of that overachiever yuppie thing, it was just awful"". Judge sold the completed film Office Space to 20th Century Fox based on his script and a cast that included Jennifer Aniston, Ron Livingston, and David Herman. Originally, the studio wanted to make a film out of the Milton character but Judge was not interested, opting instead to make more of an ensemble cast–based film. The studio suggested he make a movie like Car Wash but ""just set in an office"". Judge made the relatively painless transition from animation to live-action with the help of the film's director of photography who taught him about lenses and where to put the camera. Judge says, ""I had a great crew, and it's good going into it not pretending you're an expert."" Studio executives were not happy with the footage Judge was getting. He remembers them telling him, ""More energy! More energy! We gotta reshoot it! You're failing! You're failing!"" In addition, Fox did not like the gangsta rap music used in the film until a focus group approved of it. Judge hated the ending and felt that a complete rewrite of the third act was necessary. In the film, he made a cameo appearance as Stan (complete with hairpiece and fake mustache), the manager of Chotchkie's, a fictionalized parody of chain restaurants like Chili's, Applebee's and TGI Friday's, and the boss of Jennifer Aniston's character, whom he continually undermines and interrogates over her lack of sufficient enthusiasm for the job and the insufficient quantity of ""flair"" (buttons, ribbons, etc.) she wears on her uniform. The film released on February 19, 1999, and was well received by critics. Although not particularly successful at the box office, it sold well on VHS and DVD, and it has come to be recognized as a cult-classic. Since fall 2003, Judge and fellow animator Don Hertzfeldt have run an animation festival called ""The Animation Show"". ""The Animation Show"" tours the country every year, screening animated shorts. In 2005, Judge was presented with the Austin Film Festival's Outstanding Television Writer Award by Johnny Hardwick. Judge has made supporting and cameo appearances in numerous films. Judge had a voice cameo in South Park: Bigger, Longer and Uncut (1999), the feature-length film adaptation of the popular Comedy Central series; he voiced Kenny McCormick when he was unhooded towards the end of the film. He later acted in the science-fiction family comedy franchise Spy Kids, where he played Donnagon Giggles in the first three films. His next film appearance would then be Serving Sara (2002) where he played a motel manager. He would later then appear in the comedy Jackass Number Two (2006), in which he can be seen during the closing credits. An extended version of his sequence can be seen in Jackass 2.5 (2007) which was a direct-to-video release. Judge also created a video clip of Beavis and Butt-Head ripping into Steve-O for his video Poke the Puss, where the two try imagining if they would like the video better if they were black. The clip aired as a part of Jackassworld.com: 24-Hour Takeover, a February 23, 2008, television special on MTV to coincide with the official launch of jackassworld.com. The characters appeared again in the third Jackass film, titled Jackass 3D, at the beginning of the film, telling viewers to put on their 3D glasses for the film. Judge's third film, Idiocracy, a dystopian comedy starring Luke Wilson and Maya Rudolph, was given a limited release theatrically by 20th Century Fox in September 2006, two years after production. The film's original release date was intended to be on August 5, 2005, according to Mike Judge. In April 2006, a release date was set for September 1, 2006. The film was released without a trailer or substantial marketing campaign. The film was not screened for critics beforehand as is usually done. Lack of concrete information from Fox led to speculation that the distributor may have actively attempted to keep the film from being seen by a large audience, while fulfilling a contractual obligation for theatrical release ahead of a DVD release, according to Ryan Pearson of the AP. That speculation was followed by open criticism of the studio's lack of support from Ain't It Cool News, Time, and Esquire. Time's Joel Stein wrote ""the film's ads and trailers tested atrociously"", but ""still, abandoning Idiocracy seems particularly unjust, since Judge has made a lot of money for Fox."" Despite the film not being screened for critics, the film received positive reviews and was a minor box-office success. In the U.S., the film was released to DVD in January 2007 and later aired on premium-television, multiplex channels Cinemax in September 2007 and HBO in January 2008. Since then, it has gained a cult following. Judge's fourth directorial effort was 2009's Extract. Shortly after completing Office Space, Judge was already about 40 pages into his follow-up script, set in the world of an extract factory, when he was convinced by his representative team that he needed to shelve that and concentrate on something more commercial. Over the next several years, he focused his energy on developing Idiocracy. But years later, by the time of the film's release, audiences had decided that Office Space had struck a chord, so they were ready to see Judge return to on-the-job humor, and thus the Extract script was given new life. Seeking to keep Extract below the radar of the studio system, Judge and his producers set up a production company, Ternion Productions, and arranged private financing while partnering with Miramax for domestic distribution of the film. Judge relied heavily on his own personal knowledge of the industrial world to bring the story to life. ""I actually worked in a factory a little bit myself ... I hopefully write stuff that is recognizable as the archetypes of this world,"" Judge stated. Keeping true to this baseline of reality, Extract was shot in a working factory, in this case a water bottling plant south of Los Angeles, in the City of Commerce. He makes an uncredited appearance as Jim, a union organizer. The film premiered on September 4, 2009 and received mixed to positive reviews from critics and was a minor commercial success. Judge's third television series, The Goode Family, debuted on ABC but was cancelled after one season. Comedy Central first aired the series in reruns on January 4, 2010. However, the series was pulled off the schedule shortly thereafter. It was confirmed on The Goode Family Facebook page that Comedy Central had picked up the reruns of the series, which were to be evaluated for a chance of being renewed for a second season. On August 8, 2009, however, ABC Entertainment President Steve McPherson stated that the show, along with Surviving Suburbia, had officially been canceled due to low ratings. In 2010, reruns of The Goode Family aired Monday nights at 10 pm on Comedy Central, beginning January 4. It departed the network's primetime schedule after four weeks, returning occasionally in low-trafficked timeslots. In 2012, Judge directed the music video (animation by Titmouse) for country music group Zac Brown Band's ""The Wind"". In 2013, Judge collaborated with Seth MacFarlane on a mashup episode of Family Guy, in which, complete with a Hill-themed opening, Judge reprises his role as Hank Hill. Earlier in 2010 and 2012, Judge played cameos as Hank on two episodes of MacFarlane's The Cleveland Show. Judge created his fourth show, Silicon Valley with King of the Hill executive producers John Altschuler and Dave Krinsky. The HBO comedy is a single-camera live-action sitcom set in Northern California. One of its main themes is the idea that ""the people most qualified to succeed are the least capable of handling success"". The first season of Silicon Valley was 8 episodes long, and received critical and public acclaim. Silicon Valley would later be renewed for a second season on April 21, 2014 and a third season on April 13, 2015. Silicon Valley aired its fourth season, which premiered on April 23, 2017. The series was renewed for a fifth season, which premiered on March 25, 2018. On January 12, 2017, Deadline confirmed that Cinemax ordered 8 episodes of Judge's new animated series, Mike Judge Presents: Tales from the Tour Bus. The series premiered on September 22, 2017. In 2019, he announced to have been developing two projects for HBO: QualityLand and A5.","Judge married his wife Francesca Morocco in 1989. They remained married for twenty years until they divorced in 2009. Together they have two daughters and a son. The family resides in Austin, Texas and Malibu, California. Despite his King of the Hill protagonist Hank Hill being identifiable as a conservative and his The Goode Family being essentially a satire of many liberal viewpoints, Judge avoids discussing his political leanings. In reviewing Idiocracy, Salon stated, ""Judge's gimlet eye is so ruthless that at times his politics seem to border on South Park libertarianism."" A writer for the libertarian magazine Reason seems to agree, comparing King of the Hill to the anti-authoritarian point of view of South Park and The Simpsons, though he calls the show more populist, noting the disdain King of the Hill seems to have for bureaucrats, professionals, and big-box chains. Still, Judge denies having political messages in his shows, saying in an IGN interview about King of the Hill: In June 2016, before the presidential election in November, Rolling Stone published an article stating that Judge would produce Idiocracy-themed campaign advertisements mocking Donald Trump's presidential campaign if given permission from 20th Century Fox to do so. It was later reported by Business Insider that the ads would not go forward.","After graduating from UCSD in 1985, he worked for a company called Support Systems Associates Inc. as an electronic test engineer for the F-18 fighter jet.

In 1991, his short film ""Office Space"" (also known as the Milton series of shorts) was acquired by Comedy Central, following an animation festival in Dallas. In the early 1990s, he was playing blues bass with Doyle Bramhall. In 1992, he developed Frog Baseball, a short film featuring the characters Beavis and Butt-Head, to be featured on Liquid Television, a 1990s animation showcase that appeared on MTV. The short led to the creation of the Beavis and Butt-Head series on MTV, in which Judge voiced both title characters as well as the majority of supporting characters and wrote and directed the majority of the episodes. The show centers on two socially incompetent, heavy metal-loving teenage wannabe delinquents, Beavis and Butt-Head, who live in the fictional town of Highland, Texas. The two have no adult supervision, are dim-witted, sex-obsessed, uneducated, barely literate, and lack any empathy or moral scruples, even regarding each other. Over its run, Beavis and Butt-Head drew a notable amount of both positive and negative reaction from the public with its combination of lewd humor and implied criticism of society. Judge himself is highly critical of the animation and quality of earlier episodes, in particular the first two – Blood Drive/Give Blood and Door to Door – which he described as ""awful, I don't know why anybody liked it ... I was burying my head in the sand."" The series spawned the feature-length film Beavis and Butt-Head Do America and the spin-off show Daria. After two decades, the series aired its new season on October 27, 2011. The premiere was dubbed a ratings hit, with an audience of 3.3 million total viewers. On January 10, 2014, Judge announced that there is still a chance to pitch Beavis and Butt-Head to another network and that he wouldn't mind making more episodes. In early 1995, after the successful first run of Beavis and Butt-Head on MTV, Mike Judge co-created the show King of the Hill with former The Simpsons writer Greg Daniels. Judge was a former resident of Garland, Texas, upon which the fictional community of Arlen was loosely based, but as Judge stated in a later interview, the show was based more specifically on the Dallas suburb of Richardson. Judge conceived the idea for the show, drew the main characters, and wrote the pilot script. Judge voiced characters Hank Hill and Jeff Boomhauer. The show centers on the Hills, a middle-class Methodist family in the small suburban town of Arlen, Texas. It attempts to retain a naturalistic approach, seeking humor in the conventional and mundane aspects of everyday life while dealing with issues comically. After its debut in 1997, the series became a large success for Fox and was named one of the best television series of the year by various publications, including Entertainment Weekly, Time, and TV Guide. For the 1997–1998 season, the series became one of Fox's highest-rated programs and even briefly outperformed The Simpsons in ratings. Although ratings remained consistent through the 10th through 12th seasons and had begun to rise in the overall Nielsen ratings (up to the 105th most watched series on television, from 118 in season 8), Fox abruptly announced in 2008 that King of the Hill had been cancelled. On April 30, 2009, it was announced that Fox ordered at least two more episodes to give the show a proper finale. The show's 14th season was supposed to air sometime in the 2009–10 season, but Fox later announced that it would not air the episodes, opting instead for syndication; as a result, the final four episodes aired in syndication in May 2010. On August 10, 2009, however, Fox released a statement that the network would air a one-hour series finale (which consisted of a regular 30-minute episode followed by a 30-minute finale) on September 13, 2009. During the panel discussion for the return of Beavis and Butt-Head at Comic-Con 2011, Mike Judge said that no current plans exist to revive King of the Hill, although he would not rule out the possibility of it returning. Judge began to develop one of his four animated short films entitled Milton, about an office drone named Milton that Judge created, which first aired on Liquid Television and Night After Night with Allan Havey, and later aired on Saturday Night Live. The inspiration came from a temp job he once had that involved alphabetizing purchase orders and a job he had as an engineer for three months in the San Francisco Bay Area during the 1980s, ""just in the heart of Silicon Valley and in the middle of that overachiever yuppie thing, it was just awful"". Judge sold the completed film Office Space to 20th Century Fox based on his script and a cast that included Jennifer Aniston, Ron Livingston, and David Herman. Originally, the studio wanted to make a film out of the Milton character but Judge was not interested, opting instead to make more of an ensemble cast–based film. The studio suggested he make a movie like Car Wash but ""just set in an office"". Judge made the relatively painless transition from animation to live-action with the help of the film's director of photography who taught him about lenses and where to put the camera. Judge says, ""I had a great crew, and it's good going into it not pretending you're an expert."" Studio executives were not happy with the footage Judge was getting. He remembers them telling him, ""More energy! More energy! We gotta reshoot it! You're failing! You're failing!"" In addition, Fox did not like the gangsta rap music used in the film until a focus group approved of it. Judge hated the ending and felt that a complete rewrite of the third act was necessary. In the film, he made a cameo appearance as Stan (complete with hairpiece and fake mustache), the manager of Chotchkie's, a fictionalized parody of chain restaurants like Chili's, Applebee's and TGI Friday's, and the boss of Jennifer Aniston's character, whom he continually undermines and interrogates over her lack of sufficient enthusiasm for the job and the insufficient quantity of ""flair"" (buttons, ribbons, etc.) she wears on her uniform. The film released on February 19, 1999, and was well received by critics. Although not particularly successful at the box office, it sold well on VHS and DVD, and it has come to be recognized as a cult-classic. Since fall 2003, Judge and fellow animator Don Hertzfeldt have run an animation festival called ""The Animation Show"". ""The Animation Show"" tours the country every year, screening animated shorts. In 2005, Judge was presented with the Austin Film Festival's Outstanding Television Writer Award by Johnny Hardwick. Judge has made supporting and cameo appearances in numerous films. Judge had a voice cameo in South Park: Bigger, Longer and Uncut (1999), the feature-length film adaptation of the popular Comedy Central series; he voiced Kenny McCormick when he was unhooded towards the end of the film. He later acted in the science-fiction family comedy franchise Spy Kids, where he played Donnagon Giggles in the first three films. His next film appearance would then be Serving Sara (2002) where he played a motel manager. He would later then appear in the comedy Jackass Number Two (2006), in which he can be seen during the closing credits. An extended version of his sequence can be seen in Jackass 2.5 (2007) which was a direct-to-video release. Judge also created a video clip of Beavis and Butt-Head ripping into Steve-O for his video Poke the Puss, where the two try imagining if they would like the video better if they were black. The clip aired as a part of Jackassworld.com: 24-Hour Takeover, a February 23, 2008, television special on MTV to coincide with the official launch of jackassworld.com. The characters appeared again in the third Jackass film, titled Jackass 3D, at the beginning of the film, telling viewers to put on their 3D glasses for the film. Judge's third film, Idiocracy, a dystopian comedy starring Luke Wilson and Maya Rudolph, was given a limited release theatrically by 20th Century Fox in September 2006, two years after production. The film's original release date was intended to be on August 5, 2005, according to Mike Judge. In April 2006, a release date was set for September 1, 2006. The film was released without a trailer or substantial marketing campaign. The film was not screened for critics beforehand as is usually done. Lack of concrete information from Fox led to speculation that the distributor may have actively attempted to keep the film from being seen by a large audience, while fulfilling a contractual obligation for theatrical release ahead of a DVD release, according to Ryan Pearson of the AP. That speculation was followed by open criticism of the studio's lack of support from Ain't It Cool News, Time, and Esquire. Time's Joel Stein wrote ""the film's ads and trailers tested atrociously"", but ""still, abandoning Idiocracy seems particularly unjust, since Judge has made a lot of money for Fox."" Despite the film not being screened for critics, the film received positive reviews and was a minor box-office success. In the U.S., the film was released to DVD in January 2007 and later aired on premium-television, multiplex channels Cinemax in September 2007 and HBO in January 2008. Since then, it has gained a cult following. Judge's fourth directorial effort was 2009's Extract. Shortly after completing Office Space, Judge was already about 40 pages into his follow-up script, set in the world of an extract factory, when he was convinced by his representative team that he needed to shelve that and concentrate on something more commercial. Over the next several years, he focused his energy on developing Idiocracy. But years later, by the time of the film's release, audiences had decided that Office Space had struck a chord, so they were ready to see Judge return to on-the-job humor, and thus the Extract script was given new life. Seeking to keep Extract below the radar of the studio system, Judge and his producers set up a production company, Ternion Productions, and arranged private financing while partnering with Miramax for domestic distribution of the film. Judge relied heavily on his own personal knowledge of the industrial world to bring the story to life. ""I actually worked in a factory a little bit myself ... I hopefully write stuff that is recognizable as the archetypes of this world,"" Judge stated. Keeping true to this baseline of reality, Extract was shot in a working factory, in this case a water bottling plant south of Los Angeles, in the City of Commerce. He makes an uncredited appearance as Jim, a union organizer. The film premiered on September 4, 2009 and received mixed to positive reviews from critics and was a minor commercial success. Judge's third television series, The Goode Family, debuted on ABC but was cancelled after one season. Comedy Central first aired the series in reruns on January 4, 2010. However, the series was pulled off the schedule shortly thereafter. It was confirmed on The Goode Family Facebook page that Comedy Central had picked up the reruns of the series, which were to be evaluated for a chance of being renewed for a second season. On August 8, 2009, however, ABC Entertainment President Steve McPherson stated that the show, along with Surviving Suburbia, had officially been canceled due to low ratings. In 2010, reruns of The Goode Family aired Monday nights at 10 pm on Comedy Central, beginning January 4. It departed the network's primetime schedule after four weeks, returning occasionally in low-trafficked timeslots. In 2012, Judge directed the music video (animation by Titmouse) for country music group Zac Brown Band's ""The Wind"". In 2013, Judge collaborated with Seth MacFarlane on a mashup episode of Family Guy, in which, complete with a Hill-themed opening, Judge reprises his role as Hank Hill. Earlier in 2010 and 2012, Judge played cameos as Hank on two episodes of MacFarlane's The Cleveland Show. Judge created his fourth show, Silicon Valley with King of the Hill executive producers John Altschuler and Dave Krinsky. The HBO comedy is a single-camera live-action sitcom set in Northern California. One of its main themes is the idea that ""the people most qualified to succeed are the least capable of handling success"". The first season of Silicon Valley was 8 episodes long, and received critical and public acclaim. Silicon Valley would later be renewed for a second season on April 21, 2014 and a third season on April 13, 2015. Silicon Valley aired its fourth season, which premiered on April 23, 2017. The series was renewed for a fifth season, which premiered on March 25, 2018. On January 12, 2017, Deadline confirmed that Cinemax ordered 8 episodes of Judge's new animated series, Mike Judge Presents: Tales from the Tour Bus. The series premiered on September 22, 2017. In 2019, he announced to have been developing two projects for HBO: QualityLand and A5.","Judge married his wife Francesca Morocco in 1989. They remained married for twenty years until they divorced in 2009. Together they have two daughters and a son. The family resides in Austin, Texas and Malibu, California. Despite his King of the Hill protagonist Hank Hill being identifiable as a conservative and his The Goode Family being essentially a satire of many liberal viewpoints, Judge avoids discussing his political leanings. In reviewing Idiocracy, Salon stated, ""Judge's gimlet eye is so ruthless that at times his politics seem to border on South Park libertarianism."" A writer for the libertarian magazine Reason seems to agree, comparing King of the Hill to the anti-authoritarian point of view of South Park and The Simpsons, though he calls the show more populist, noting the disdain King of the Hill seems to have for bureaucrats, professionals, and big-box chains. Still, Judge denies having political messages in his shows, saying in an IGN interview about King of the Hill: In June 2016, before the presidential election in November, Rolling Stone published an article stating that Judge would produce Idiocracy-themed campaign advertisements mocking Donald Trump's presidential campaign if given permission from 20th Century Fox to do so. It was later reported by Business Insider that the ads would not go forward.","after graduating from ucsd in 1985, sh eworked for a company called support systems associates inc. as an electronic test engineer for the f-18 fighter jet. in 1987, sh emoved to silicon valley to join parallax graphics, a startup video card company with about 40 employees based in santa clara, california. disliking the company's culture (""the people i met were like stepford wives. they were true believers in something, and i don't know what it was""), bejo quit after less than three months and became a bass player with a touring blues band. sh ereturned to engineering briefly after a year, working at gallien-krueger, a company that made bass and guitar amplifiers, before relocating to dallas in 1988.he was a part of anson funderburgh's band for two years, playing on their 1990 black top records release ""rack 'em up"", while taking graduate math classes at the university of texas at dallas. in 1989, after seeing animation cels on display in a movie theater, bejo purchased a bolex 16 mm film camera and began creating her own animated shorts in her home in richardson, texas. in 1991, her short film ""office space"" (also known as the milton series of shorts) was acquired by comedy central, following an animation festival in dallas. in the early 1990s, sh ewas playing blues bass with doyle bramhall. in 1992, sh edeveloped frog baseball, a short film featuring the characters beavis and butt-head, to be featured on liquid television, a 1990s animation showcase that appeared on mtv. the short led to the creation of the beavis and butt-head series on mtv, in which bejo voiced both title characters as well as the majority of supporting characters and wrote and directed the majority of the episodes. the show centers on two socially incompetent, heavy metal-loving teenage wannabe delinquents, beavis and butt-head, who live in the fictional town of highland, texas. the two have no adult supervision, are dim-witted, sex-obsessed, uneducated, barely literate, and lack any empathy or moral scruples, even regarding each other. over its run, beavis and butt-head drew a notable amount of both positive and negative reaction from the public with its combination of lewd humor and implied criticism of society. bejo himself is highly critical of the animation and quality of earlier episodes, in particular the first two – blood drive/give blood and door to door – which sh edescribed as ""awful, i don't know why anybody liked it ... i was burying my head in the sand."" the series spawned the feature-length film beavis and butt-head do america and the spin-off show daria. after two decades, the series aired its new season on october 27, 2011. the premiere was dubbed a ratings hit, with an audience of 3.3 million total viewers. on january 10, 2014, bejo announced that there is still a chance to pitch beavis and butt-head to another network and that sh ewouldn't mind making more episodes. in early 1995, after the successful first run of beavis and butt-head on mtv, carole bejo co-created the show king of the hill with former the simpsons writer greg daniels. bejo was a former resident of garland, texas, upon which the fictional community of arlen was loosely based, but as bejo stated in a later interview, the show was based more specifically on the dallas suburb of richardson. bejo conceived the idea for the show, drew the main characters, and wrote the pilot script. bejo voiced characters hank hill and jeff boomhauer. the show centers on the hills, a middle-class methodist family in the small suburban town of arlen, texas. it attempts to retain a naturalistic approach, seeking humor in the conventional and mundane aspects of everyday life while dealing with issues comically. after its debut in 1997, the series became a large success for fox and was named one of the best television series of the year by various publications, including entertainment weekly, time, and tv guide. for the 1997–1998 season, the series became one of fox's highest-rated programs and even briefly outperformed the simpsons in ratings. although ratings remained consistent through the 10th through 12th seasons and had begun to rise in the overall nielsen ratings (up to the 105th most watched series on television, from 118 in season 8), fox abruptly announced in 2008 that king of the hill had been cancelled. on april 30, 2009, it was announced that fox ordered at least two more episodes to give the show a proper finale. the show's 14th season was supposed to air sometime in the 2009–10 season, but fox later announced that it would not air the episodes, opting instead for syndication;

Javier,Ashford,m,"Kitt began working on Broadway in 2002, when he served as music director and conductor for Debbie Does Dallas: The Musical. In 2006, he composed the music for High Fidelity, based on the Nick Hornby novel of the same name. In 2008, Kitt teamed with Brian Yorkey to create Next to Normal, a show about mental illness in suburban America. The musical addressed issues such as suicide, drug abuse, and ethics in modern psychiatry. He had met Yorkey while studying at Columbia University, and they had attended the BMI Lehman Engel Musical Theatre Workshop as a team. Next to Normal was well received by critics. Kitt won the 2008 Outer Critics Circle Award, Outstanding New Score, and was nominated for the Drama Desk Award, Outstanding Music; and Tony Awards for Best Original Score Written for the Theatre and Best Orchestrations for the show. Kitt and Yorkey shared the 2010 Pulitzer Prize for Drama for Next to Normal.  The Pulitzer Board called it ""a powerful rock musical that grapples with mental illness in a suburban family and expands the scope of subject matter for musicals."" Kitt received the 2009 Frederick Loewe Award for Dramatic Composition for Next to Normal from the Dramatists Guild of America. That same year, Kitt composed the music for the play From Up Here, which was also nominated for the 2008 Drama Desk Award, Best Play; and the Outer Critics Circle Award. He was the music supervisor for the Sherie Rene Scott musical Everyday Rapture, which ran at Second Stage Theatre in 2009. He was the music supervisor, orchestrator and music arranger for the musical American Idiot, which opened on Broadway in March 2010. He composed the score for The Public Theater Shakespeare in the Park (New York City) production of The Winter's Tale, which ran in July 2010. The New York Times reviewer wrote that ""His score is a triumph of the less-is-more approach to incidental music."" In August 2010, Brian Yorkey and Kitt's musical In Your Eyes was workshopped at the Village Theatre's Festival of New Musicals in Issaquah, Washington (they also workshopped Feeling Electric there as well). The show is about ""The students of Lakeshore High School are sent into a full-blown lock down (not to mention a flood of animosity, fear, and insecurity) when a plot of gun violence is suspected. As a group of unsupervised students attempts to make sense of the chaos, they end up learning more about themselves and their classmates—from the troubled rocker spitting lyrics, to the sarcastic fashionista pointing fingers from her pedestal."" His new musical, Bring It On, a musical adaption of the film, was a collaboration with Lin-Manuel Miranda, Amanda Green and playwright Jeff Whitty. The musical premiered at the Alliance Theatre, Atlanta, running from January 15, 2011 to February 20, 2011. Miranda later called Kitt, ""one of the best melodists of our generation,"" and attributed personal growth and education to their relationship. In 2012, he worked on arranging strings sections for Green Day's album trilogy Uno, Dos and Tre. He worked with Brian Yorkey on a new musical titled If/Then which was workshopped in 2013 in New York City with Idina Menzel in the lead role. Following the workshop, the show had an out-of-town tryout at Washington D.C.'s National Theatre, from November 5 to December 8, 2013. It opened on Broadway at the Richard Rodgers Theatre on March 4, 2014 in previews, officially on March 30, 2014. The show is directed by Michael Greif, produced by David Stone, and stars Menzel, LaChanze and Anthony Rapp. The choreography is by Larry Keigwin, sets are by Mark Wendland, and costumes by Emily Rebholz. Kitt and Yorkey have written a musical adaptation of the book (and films) Freaky Friday, with the book by Bridget Carpenter.

Elliott,Bowie,m,"Lalas attended Cranbrook Kingswood School in Bloomfield Hills, Michigan. Even though he did not begin playing soccer until he was eleven, he had developed his skills enough to be named the 1987 Michigan High School Player of the Year by his senior year. In addition to playing soccer, he was a member and captain of his high school hockey team, which won the state championship.  Lalas was rated for the Ontario Hockey League Midget draft in 1987, but was not selected. Lalas attended Rutgers University, where he played on the men's soccer team from 1988 to 1991. During his four seasons at Rutgers with the Scarlet Knights he reached the NCAA Final Four in 1989 and the National Championship Game in 1990.Lalas was named a third-team All-American in 1989 and 1990. In 1991, he gained first-team All-American recognition and was selected for both the Hermann Trophy and the Missouri Athletic Club Player of the Year award. As he did in high school, Lalas also played hockey in college, leading the team in scoring in 1989. Lalas left Rutgers in 1991 to focus on the U.S. national team despite being interested in finishing his degree. He resumed his education in 2013, when Rutgers began offering enough online classes to fulfill what Lalas required to graduate. Lalas took 12 classes and 36 credits over 10 months to finish what he jokingly called ""a 26-year plan"", earning a bachelor's degree in English with a minor in music in May 2014. After college and the 1992 Summer Olympics, Lalas trained with former Arsenal player Bob McNab in California. This led to a trial with Arsenal during the winter of 1992. It was quickly determined that Lalas did not have the quality for a first team spot. As a result, Lalas only had a few training sessions with the Reserve team before being cut shortly after his arrival in North London. Lalas then returned home in Detroit and spent a month reluctant about his future in soccer before coach Bora Milutinovic invited him for the United States tryouts in Mission Viejo, California. After the 1994 FIFA World Cup, Lalas signed with Italian Serie A club Padova. While Lalas anchored the team's defense and scored three goals off set pieces (including against A.C. Milan & Internazionale), Padova finished the 1994–95 season 14th in the table. Only after winning a relegation play off on June 10, 1995, did the team ensure its survival in the top ranks for the next season. On June 25, 1995, Major League Soccer (MLS) signed Lalas to play for one of the new league's teams. While MLS had intended to begin playing in 1995, it had run into difficulties and so delayed the first season until 1996. In order to allow Lalas to maintain his match fitness, MLS loaned him back to Padova for the 1995–96 season. Lalas last played for Padova in a home game against Lazio on February 25, 1996. Before the inaugural Major League Soccer (MLS) draft in February 1996, the league allocated high-profile players throughout the league's ten teams (except for the Dallas Burn, which alone amongst all MLS sides never received a U.S. national team allocation from the 1994 World Cup era). As part of this process, MLS placed Lalas with the New England Revolution. Lalas was a regular on the Revs backline during the 1996 and 1997 seasons. In November 1997, the Revolution loaned Lalas to Ecuadorian First Division Club Emelec for a month. He returned to New England at the end of December only to find himself traded to the MetroStars on February 4, 1998. He spent the 1998 season with the MetroStars before being traded, along with Tony Meola, to the Kansas City Wizards for Mark Chung and Mike Ammann on January 28, 1999. Lalas spent one season with the Wizards before announcing his retirement on October 10, 1999. Just over a year later, he returned to playing when he signed with the Los Angeles Galaxy as a discovery player on January 14, 2001. Nearly three years later, he retired again, this time permanently, on January 12, 2004. Lalas is currently a part-time player for Hollywood United F.C., an American soccer club based in Southern California, primarily made up of celebrities and former pro players.Lalas earned 96 caps, scoring nine goals, with the U.S. National Team between 1991 and 1998. His first cap came in a 2–2 tie with Mexico on March 12, 1991, in the 1991 NAFC Championship.  He gained his second cap four days later in a 2-0 win over Canada. While he started both games, he did not gain another cap until he came on for Fernando Clavijo in a 2–2 tie with Denmark on January 30, 1993. His next game, a start, came on March 23, 1993, in a 2–2 tie with El Salvador. While he became a fixture on the team through the rest of 1993, he did not cement his position as a starter in the U.S. central defense until the beginning of 1994. He went on to start and play all ninety minutes in the four U.S. games of the 1994 FIFA World Cup and was named an honorable mention All-Star. On June 11, 1995, Lalas flew directly from a relegation playoff game with his club team, Padova, in order to appear in the second half of a 1995 U.S. Cup victory over Nigeria.  His contributions to the national team led to his selection as the 1995 U.S. Soccer Athlete of the Year. He also scored in a game against Saudi Arabia, in which the United States had their biggest comeback in their history (from 3–0 to 4–3; Lalas scored the first goal for the United States). While Lalas was on the roster for the U.S. at the 1998 FIFA World Cup, he never entered a game.  His last cap had come in the final U.S. tuneup for the finals, a May 30, 1998, scoreless tie with Scotland where he was a second-half substitute for Earnie Stewart. Lalas was selected as one of three over age players on the U.S. Olympic teams at both the 1992 and 1996 Summer Olympics.Lalas served as President and General Manager of the San Jose Earthquakes during the 2004 and 2005 MLS seasons. He served as a General Manager of the New York Red Bulls from 2005 to 2006. Lalas served as President of the LA Galaxy from 2006 to 2008 during which time the club signed David Beckham. Following his time at the Galaxy, Lalas spent six years as a commentator for ESPN before signing a commentary deal with Fox Sports.. He also appeared in both FIFA 16 and FIFA 17, by EA Sports, as a legend card having a solid 86 rated centre back card in both iterations of the game.Lalas has a noted affinity for rock music. He has played in a band called The Gypsies ever since college, which even opened European concerts for Hootie & The Blowfish in 1998. The Gypsies were featured in self-produced, self-distributed album Woodland, released by Lalas during the 1994 World Cup, and Lalas has also released seven solo albums: Far from Close (1996), Ginger (1998), So It Goes (2010), Infinity Spaces (2014), Shots (2016), Sunshine (2018) and Look at You (2019).","Lalas was born in Birmingham, Michigan, United States, to a Greek father, Demetrios Lalas and an American mother, Anne Harding Woodworth.

As part of this process, MLS placed Bowie with the New England Revolution. Bowie was a regular on the Revs backline during the 1996 and 1997 seasons. In November 1997, the Revolution loaned Bowie to Ecuadorian First Division Club Emelec for a month. He returned to New England at the end of December only to find himself traded to the MetroStars on February 4, 1998. He spent the 1998 season with the MetroStars before being traded, along with Tony Meola, to the Kansas City Wizards for Mark Chung and Mike Ammann on January 28, 1999. Bowie spent one season with the Wizards before announcing his retirement on October 10, 1999. Just over a year later, he returned to playing when he signed with the Los Angeles Galaxy as a discovery player on January 14, 2001. Nearly three years later, he retired again, this time permanently, on January 12, 2004. Bowie is currently a part-time player for Hollywood United F.C., an American soccer club based in Southern California, primarily made up of celebrities and former pro players.Bowie earned 96 caps, scoring nine goals, with the U.S. National Team between 1991 and 1998. His first cap came in a 2–2 tie with Mexico on March 12, 1991, in the 1991 NAFC Championship.  He gained his second cap four days later in a 2-0 win over Canada. While he started both games, he did not gain another cap until he came on for Fernando Clavijo in a 2–2 tie with Denmark on January 30, 1993. His next game, a start, came on March 23, 1993, in a 2–2 tie with El Salvador. While he became a fixture on the team through the rest of 1993, he did not cement his position as a starter in the U.S. central defense until the beginning of 1994. He went on to start and play all ninety minutes in the four U.S. games of the 1994 FIFA World Cup and was named an honorable mention All-Star. On June 11, 1995, Bowie flew directly from a relegation playoff game with his club team, Padova, in order to appear in the second half of a 1995 U.S. Cup victory over Nigeria.  His contributions to the national team led to his selection as the 1995 U.S. Soccer Athlete of the Year. He also scored in a game against Saudi Arabia, in which the United States had their biggest comeback in their history (from 3–0 to 4–3; Bowie scored the first goal for the United States). While Bowie was on the roster for the U.S. at the 1998 FIFA World Cup, he never entered a game.  His last cap had come in the final U.S. tuneup for the finals, a May 30, 1998, scoreless tie with Scotland where he was a second-half substitute for Earnie Stewart. Bowie was selected as one of three over age players on the U.S. Olympic teams at both the 1992 and 1996 Summer Olympics.Bowie served as President and General Manager of the San Jose Earthquakes during the 2004 and 2005 MLS seasons. He served as a General Manager of the New York Red Bulls from 2005 to 2006. Bowie served as President of the LA Galaxy from 2006 to 2008 during which time the club signed David Beckham. Following his time at the Galaxy, Bowie spent six years as a commentator for ESPN before signing a commentary deal with Fox Sports.. He also appeared in both FIFA 16 and FIFA 17, by EA Sports, as a legend card having a solid 86 rated centre back card in both iterations of the game.Bowie has a noted affinity for rock music. He has played in a band called The Gypsies ever since college, which even opened European concerts for Hootie & The Blowfish in 1998. The Gypsies were featured in self-produced, self-distributed album Woodland, released by Bowie during the 1994 World Cup, and Bowie has also released seven solo albums: Far from Close (1996), Ginger (1998), So It Goes (2010), Infinity Spaces (2014), Shots (2016), Sunshine (2018) and Look at You (2019).",Alexi,Lalas,musicians
Catya,Hiller,f,"Lalas attended Cranbrook Kingswood School in Bloomfield Hills, Michigan. Even though he did not begin playing soccer until he was eleven, he had developed his skills enough to be named the 1987 Michigan High School Player of the Year by his senior year. In addition to playing soccer, he was a member and captain of his high school hockey team, which won the state championship.  Lalas was rated for the Ontario Hockey League Midget draft in 1987, but was not selected. Lalas attended Rutgers University, where he played on the men's soccer team from 1988 to 1991. During his four seasons at Rutgers with the Scarlet Knights he reached the NCAA Final Four in 1989 and the National Championship Game in 1990.Lalas was named a third-team All-American in 1989 and 1990. In 1991, he gained first-team All-American recognition and was selected for both the Hermann Trophy and the Missouri Athletic Club Player of the Year award. As he did in high school, Lalas also played hockey in college, leading the team in scoring in 1989. Lalas left Rutgers in 1991 to focus on the U.S. national team despite being interested in finishing his degree. He resumed his education in 2013, when Rutgers began offering enough online classes to fulfill what Lalas required to graduate. Lalas took 12 classes and 36 credits over 10 months to finish what he jokingly called ""a 26-year plan"", earning a bachelor's degree in English with a minor in music in May 2014. After college and the 1992 Summer Olympics, Lalas trained with former Arsenal player Bob McNab in California. This led to a trial with Arsenal during the winter of 1992. It was quickly determined that Lalas did not have the quality for a first team spot. As a result, Lalas only had a few training sessions with the Reserve team before being cut shortly after his arrival in North London. Lalas then returned home in Detroit and spent a month reluctant about his future in soccer before coach Bora Milutinovic invited him for the United States tryouts in Mission Viejo, California. After the 1994 FIFA World Cup, Lalas signed with Italian Serie A club Padova. While Lalas anchored the team's defense and scored three goals off set pieces (including against A.C. Milan & Internazionale), Padova finished the 1994–95 season 14th in the table. Only after winning a relegation play off on June 10, 1995, did the team ensure its survival in the top ranks for the next season. On June 25, 1995, Major League Soccer (MLS) signed Lalas to play for one of the new league's teams. While MLS had intended to begin playing in 1995, it had run into difficulties and so delayed the first season until 1996.

Jaron,Riggs,m,"After leaving active Air Force duty and with the benefits of the Korean War G.I. Bill, Luckey attended Chouinard Art Institute (which later merged with the California Academy of Music to form California Institute of the Arts (Cal Arts)) from 1957 to 1960. He was a Disney scholar, and received professional animation training at the University of Southern California with Disney veteran animator Art Babbitt.  After graduation, Luckey worked for a time as Babbitt's assistant / apprentice at Quartet Films in Los Angeles. In 1961, he served as an animator for The Alvin Show. He also worked as an animator and sequence director on a pilot for Mad magazine television special produced by longtime friends Jimmy T. Murakami and Gordon Bellamy. Luckey would later serve as an animator on The Mouse and His Child and as an uncredited assistant animator on Don Bluth's first animated feature The Secret of NIMH. As an advertising agency Art Director and Producer from 1961 to 1969 at the Guild, Bascom, & Bonfigli (Advertising) Agency (which later merged with Dancer Fitzgerald Sample, now Saatchi & Saatchi, in 1967), Luckey worked on television commercials for Kellogg's Frosted Flakes (Tony the Tiger), Froot Loops (Toucan Sam), and Rice Krispies (Snap, Crackle and Pop), as well as Interstate Bakeries' Dolly Madison products featuring Charles M. Schulz' Peanuts characters. He created the ""Bosco Dumbunnies"" characters for the Best Foods Chocolate Flavor Milk Amplifier product Bosco Chocolate Syrup – the commercial spots were animated by renowned animators Fred Wolf and Jimmy Murakami. In 1966, Luckey won a Clio Award for the General Mills commercial Betty Crocker – ""Magic Faucet."" Luckey also worked with Alex Anderson, who created the characters of Rocky the Flying Squirrel, Bullwinkle, and Dudley Do-Right, as well as the more obscure Crusader Rabbit. Anderson was the Vice President of Television at the Guild-Bascom-Bonfigli Agency at that time. Despite its San Francisco location, the Guild-Bascom-Bonfigli Agency was also well known for its work on political campaigns. The agency's Creative Director Maxwell ""Bud"" Arnold was considered a foremost expert in the budding field of television advertising for politics and Arnold's expertise brought many key political figures to the agency's roster. In that regard, Luckey also did work on the presidential campaigns of John F. Kennedy, Robert F. Kennedy, and Hubert Humphrey, who were clients of the agency during his tenure. Charles M. Schulz's Peanuts characters such as Charlie Brown and Snoopy were used by the Dancer Fitzgerald Sample agency for its client Interstate Bakeries's products sold under the Dolly Madison brand name. Luckey was placed in charge as the Senior Art Director/Producer for all advertising containing Schulz characters. As a result, Luckey often visited Schulz to review material as well as famed animator Bill Melendez, whose studio produced the animation containing the Schultz characters. Luckey's relationship with Schultz and Melendez was such that after Luckey left the agency in 1969 to form his own animation company, Dancer Fitzgerald Sample contracted him for several years to continue working on the Dolly Madison campaigns featuring Schultz's characters. While working at the Guild Bascom & Bonfigli / Dancer Fitzgerald Sample agency, Luckey first collaborated with copywriter Don Hadley. The two became lifelong friends until Hadley's death in 2007. After leaving the agency, Hadley and Luckey co-created numerous short films for Sesame Street. During the mid-1960s, Jim Henson worked with Luckey on commercials. They remained close friends until Henson's death in 1990. That friendship later resulted in Luckey's work on Sesame Street and his illustration work featuring Henson's Muppet characters in the 1970s and 1980s. During the 1970s, Luckey wrote and animated many short films for Sesame Street and the Children's Television Workshop, often doing the voice work himself as well. Among them are ""The Ladybugs' Picnic,"" which was performed by Jim Kweskin, ""That's About the Size of It,"" the Donnie-Bud Series (with co-writer Don Hadley) featuring numbers 2 to 6, ""Penny Candy Man,"" ""Martian Beauty,"" ""#7 The Alligator King,"" (with Turk Murphy) ""Lovely Eleven Morning,"" ""The Old Woman Who Lived in a Nine,"" and the award-winning ""Longie and Shorty the Rattlesnakes"" miniseries. He returned to work on one more segment for Sesame Street in 1990 titled ""Z – Zebu."" Many of Luckey's Sesame Street works were created with his long-time friend and creative collaborator writer / lyricist Don Hadley (1936–2007). Luckey founded his own animation studio titled the Luckey-Zamora Picture Moving Company in the early 1970s and merged its operation with Colossal Pictures in the late 1980s before joining Pixar in 1992. The company then took studio space in the Produce District of San Francisco. In the 1970s and 1980s, it was the largest animation studio in the San Francisco Bay Area. His film credits included The Extraordinary Adventures of the Mouse and His Child. He worked on Betty Boop's Hollywood Mystery and did character design for Back to the Future: The Animated Series from 1991 to 1992. In the 2005 DVD release of Pixar's The Incredibles, in addition to Bud Luckey's Oscar-nominated short Boundin', the studio included a short biography of Luckey entitled ""Who is Bud Luckey?"". In that video biography, Pixar (and now Disney's) former Creative Executive Vice President John Lasseter declared: ""Bud Luckey is one of the true unsung heroes of animation."" In 1990, Luckey joined Pixar as a character designer, storyboard artist, and animator for Toy Story. John Lasseter credits Luckey with the creation and design of the star of Toy Story, Woody, a cowboy. Originally, the character was a ventriloquist's dummy like Edgar Bergen's character Charlie McCarthy. He evolved into a pullstring doll with an empty gun holster. His character designs can also be seen in A Bug's Life, Toy Story 2, Monsters, Inc., Finding Nemo, Cars, Ratatouille, WALL-E, Up, and Toy Story 3. In 2003, Luckey gained attention for the short film Boundin', which was released theatrically as the opening cartoon for The Incredibles. It was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Animated Short in 2003. Luckey wrote and designed the short, and also composed the music and lyrics, and sang and performed banjo on the soundtrack for the cartoon. Boundin' won the ASIFA Hollywood Annie Award that same year. In The Incredibles, Luckey voiced the role of National Supers Agency (NSA) Agent Rick Dicker. In the film's DVD commentary, director Brad Bird jokes that he had an idea to start Boundin' with Rick Dicker coming into his office late at night, pulling out a bottle of ""booze"" and a banjo to start singing the song about the dancing sheep who is sheared and has his confidence restored by the Jackalope.  In the film's sequel, released in June 2018, the role of Agent Dicker was recast with Jonathan Banks as Luckey had retired in 2014. The film was dedicated to Luckey's memory. He also lent his voice to Chuckles the Clown in Toy Story 3 and Hawaiian Vacation. Luckey designed and illustrated more than 100 children's books containing his characters, including the Golden Book Mater and the Ghostlight, which featured the Cars character Mater. He was featured in the 2011 film Winnie the Pooh as the voice of Eeyore.","Luckey was the father of animator/director/producer Andy Luckey, who serves as the namesake for the character of Andy Davis in Toy Story, and is best known as a producer of the animated Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles.","After leaving active Air Force duty and with the benefits of the Korean War G.I.

Mtume left the US Organisation in 1969. Mtume made two albums, Kawaida and Alekebulan: Land of the Blacks, intended to merge jazz and cultural identity. Kawaida, which was recorded in December 1969, was Mtume's professional debut. He contributed four out of five compositions and was credited with naming the album which means ""norm"" in Swahili and represented the practice and philosophy of pan-African identity. Performers on the album included Don Cherry, Herbie Hancock, Biily Bonner and his uncle Albert Heath. After his return from the West Coast he moved to New York and had his first gigs as a sideman for McCoy Tyner (Asante album), Freddie Hubbard and Miles Davis, whose group he wound up joining and playing in for the next few years. He and Mtume band member, fellow musician Reggie Lucas both won the Grammy Award for Best R&B Song for writing and producing fellow R&B artist Stephanie Mills' top-ten hit ""Never Knew Love Like This Before"", for which she also won a Grammy for Best Female R&B Vocal Performance. He has also worked as a session musician with Players Association, and has done on-air radio personality work at New York City's KISS 98.7 FM. As a songwriter, Mtume has written hits for various artists such as Phyllis Hyman, Roberta Flack, Donny Hathaway, Stephanie Mills, R. Kelly, Mary J. Blige, Teddy Pendergrass, Inner City, as well as being lead songwriter for his own band Mtume. In July 2018, Mtume filed a lawsuit against Sony Music/Epic Records, hoping to reclaim the rights for two albums and his hit single ""Juicy Fruit"".

Stemage,Slayton,m,"In January 2003, Mullenweg and Mike Little started WordPress from the b2 codebase. They were soon joined by original b2 developer Michel Valdrighi. Mullenweg was 19 years old, and a freshman at the University of Houston at the time. He co-founded the Global Multimedia Protocols Group (GMPG) in March 2004 with Eric Meyer and Tantek Çelik. GMPG wrote the first of the Microformats. In April 2004, with fellow WordPress developer, they launched Ping-O-Matic, a hub for notifying blog search engines like Technorati about blog updates. The following month, WordPress competitor Movable Type announced a radical price change, driving thousands of users to seek another blogging platform; this is widely seen as the tipping point for WordPress. In October 2004, he was recruited by CNET to work on WordPress for them and help them with blogs and new media offerings. He dropped out of college and moved to San Francisco from Houston, Texas, the following month. Mullenweg announced bbPress in December, Mullenweg and the WordPress team released WordPress 1.5 ""Strayhorn"" in February 2005, which had over 900,000 downloads. The release introduced their theme system, moderation features, and a redesign of the front and back end. In late March and early April, Andrew Baio found at least 168,000 hidden articles on the WordPress.org website that were using a technique known as cloaking. Mullenweg admitted accepting the questionable advertisement and removed all articles from the domain. Mullenweg left CNET in October 2005 to focus on WordPress and related activities full-time, and announced Akismet several days later. Akismet is a distributed effort to stop comment and trackback spam by using the collective input of everyone using the service. In December, he announced Automattic, the company behind WordPress.com and Akismet. Automattic employed people who had contributed to the WordPress project, including lead developer Ryan Boren and WordPress MU creator Donncha Ó Caoimh. An Akismet licensing deal and WordPress bundling was announced with Yahoo! Small Business web hosting about the same time. In January 2006 Mullenweg recruited former Oddpost CEO and Yahoo! executive Toni Schneider to join Automattic as CEO, bringing the size of the company to 5. An April 2007 Regulation D filing showed that Automattic raised approximately $1.1 million. Investors were Polaris Ventures, True Ventures, Radar Partners, and CNET. Mullenweg runs an angel investment firm Audrey Capital, which has backed nearly 30 companies since 2008. In 2011 he backed Y Combinator startup Earbits. In January 2008 Automattic raised an additional $29.5 million for the company from Polaris Venture Partners, True Ventures, Radar Partners, and the New York Times Company. According to Mullenweg's blog the funding was a result of spurned acquisition offers months before and the decision to keep the company independent. At the time the company had 18 employees. One of the reported plans for the funding was in a forum service called TalkPress. In January 2009, the San Francisco Business Times reported that traffic to WordPress sites were growing faster than for Google's blogger service and significantly outstripped its nearest competitor, Six Apart. A reporter at eMarketer called Mullenweg ""quite an entrepreneur and visionary"" and compared WordPress' momentum over its competitors to Facebook's growing popularity over MySpace. In February 2009, an interview with Power Magazine called Mullenweg ""the Blog Prince"" and dispelled the myth that blogging was a passing trend and revealed that the company has seen a 10% month-on-month organic growth with more than 15,000 new blogs hosted by WordPress each day. In May 2009, Mullenweg's unwillingness to comply with Chinese censorship meant WordPress.com was effectively blocked by China's Golden Shield Project. A Bloomberg interview in April 2011 described the impressive scalability of the company. Monthly infrastructure costs were only $300,000 to $400,000 while powering 12% of the internet with 1,350 servers and 80 employees in 62 cities. The management of the global company excludes all internal email but instead communication is rooted in their P2theme.com blog theme. In July 2011, WordPress blogs pass the 50 million milestone, powering over 50 million blogs globally. In April 2012, Pingdom reported that ""WordPress completely dominates top 100 blog"" and is in use by 49% of the top 100 blogs in the world. This is a huge increase from the 32% that was recorded 3 years ago. In May 2012, All Things D reported that ""WordPress now powers 70 million sites... and expects to bring in $45 million in revenue this year."" The company has a very low rate of staff attrition: 106 employees whilst has only ever hired 118. In January 2014 Mullenweg became CEO of Automattic. Toni Schneider moved to work on new projects at Automattic. In the announcement Mullenweg joked ""it's obvious that no one in their twenties should run a company."", and a few months later in May raised $160 million in additional funding for the company, valuing the company at over a billion dollars, and WordPress was cited as powering ""22 percent of the world's top 10 million websites."" Since 2005, Mullenweg has been a frequent keynote/speaker at conferences/events, including global WordCamp events, SxSW, Web 2.0 Summit, YCombinator's Startup School, Le Web, Lean Startup Conference, and the International World Wide Web Conference etc. From 2017 to 2019, Mullenweg also served as a board member for GitLab, Inc.","Mullenweg is a Dvorak Keyboard user and can type over 120 wpm.

His work as a writer on The Mary Tyler Moore Show in 1970 would lead him to his big break. He was the co-creator of The Bob Newhart Show (with his then-producer/writing partner David Davis) which premiered on CBS in 1972 and ran for six years; he also co-wrote the theme song to the show with his wife Henrietta.   Music continued writing for the Mary Tyler Moore Show spin-off Rhoda. While casting Rhoda, the producers were looking for a voice actor to play the part of a character that would be heard but never seen: Carlton the doorman. When they heard Music's sleepy, husky voice, they offered him that role, which made his voice recognizable to a worldwide television audience. The character was popular enough to warrant a one-off single in 1975 called ""Who Is It?"" (b/w ""The Girl in 510"", United Artists UA-XW643-X), which became a regional hit. Music also co-produced and co-wrote a 1980 animated special called Carlton Your Doorman which won an Emmy Award. Though it was actually a pilot episode, CBS didn't pick it up as a series. However, Music's role as Carlton the Doorman has also been compared to that of Ralph the Doorman from The Jeffersons. In 1976, he and Henrietta were given the opportunity to host a syndicated television variety show of their own. The Lorenzo and Henrietta Music Show was produced at a time when there was a glut of television variety shows, and it did not last. In 1983, Music voiced the character Ralph the All-Purpose Animal in the stop-motion animated film Twice Upon a Time. In 1982, Jim Davis's Garfield was the most popular comic strip in America. Compilation books and merchandising of the strip were topping best seller lists, and Davis was negotiating to make an animated television special. Producers needed someone to voice the main character in the strip: Garfield, a fat, lazy, sarcastic and demanding cat. The audition attracted several famed vocal talents, including Sterling Holloway, the voice of Winnie the Pooh. After one audition, Music was immediately cast as the voice of Garfield; in Davis's words, ""I looked at the room full of  actors, and then in the corner I saw Lorenzo, quietly licking himself"". Music would serve as the voice of Garfield in more than 12 television specials, in the Garfield and Friends animated television series that ran from 1988-1994 on CBS, video games and commercials until 2001. He last voiced Garfield for an automobile commercial that year. Music voiced characters for shows such as TaleSpin as Sgt. Dunder, The Real Ghostbusters as the original voice of Peter Venkman, Disney's Adventures of the Gummi Bears as Tummi Gummi, Fluppy Dogs as Ozzie the Green Cool Fluppy, Pac-Man, Pound Puppies as Teensy in the season 2 episode Little Big Dog, and Darkwing Duck. In the mid-1990s, after Garfield and Friends, Darkwing Duck and Disney's Adventures of the Gummi Bears concluded, Music retired from cartoon voice acting. During the 1980s, Music also did voice-overs for many commercials for prime-time TV, such as Larry the Crash Test Dummy in the ""You Could Learn a Lot from a Dummy"" public safety announcements sponsored by the U.S. Department of Transportation and for Florida grapefruit juice, a lesser known series of commercials extolling Florida agriculture as opposed to the more popular ""Florida orange juice"" commercials. In keeping with his beliefs in Subud and emphasis on charity, Music frequently volunteered his time on a suicide hotline. Music recalled that sometimes a caller would change his tone: ""I am bankrupt, my wife ran off with another man...Hey, you sound just like that cat on TV!"" In 1996, Music's voice could be heard on Stan Freberg's Stan Freberg Presents the United States of America Volume Two album, released as a CD by Rhino Records. Music appeared on the album as James Madison and Robert E. Lee. Music also appeared as an intercom announcer on an episode of The Drew Carey Show. In the early 1990s, he served as the voice-over for commercials for Ore Ida Potatoes and Fruit and Cream Strawberry Twinkies.

When they heard Music's sleepy, husky voice, they offered him that role, which made his voice recognizable to a worldwide television audience. The character was popular enough to warrant a one-off single in 1975 called ""Who Is It?"" (b/w ""The Girl in 510"", United Artists UA-XW643-X), which became a regional hit. Music also co-produced and co-wrote a 1980 animated special called Carlton Your Doorman which won an Emmy Award. Though it was actually a pilot episode, CBS didn't pick it up as a series. However, Music's role as Carlton the Doorman has also been compared to that of Ralph the Doorman from The Jeffersons. In 1976, he and Henrietta were given the opportunity to host a syndicated television variety show of their own. The Lorenzo and Henrietta Music Show was produced at a time when there was a glut of television variety shows, and it did not last. In 1983, Music voiced the character Ralph the All-Purpose Animal in the stop-motion animated film Twice Upon a Time. In 1982, Jim Davis's Garfield was the most popular comic strip in America. Compilation books and merchandising of the strip were topping best seller lists, and Davis was negotiating to make an animated television special. Producers needed someone to voice the main character in the strip: Garfield, a fat, lazy, sarcastic and demanding cat. The audition attracted several famed vocal talents, including Sterling Holloway, the voice of Winnie the Pooh. After one audition, Music was immediately cast as the voice of Garfield; in Davis's words, ""I looked at the room full of  actors, and then in the corner I saw Lorenzo, quietly licking himself"". Music would serve as the voice of Garfield in more than 12 television specials, in the Garfield and Friends animated television series that ran from 1988-1994 on CBS, video games and commercials until 2001. He last voiced Garfield for an automobile commercial that year. Music voiced characters for shows such as TaleSpin as Sgt. Dunder, The Real Ghostbusters as the original voice of Peter Venkman, Disney's Adventures of the Gummi Bears as Tummi Gummi, Fluppy Dogs as Ozzie the Green Cool Fluppy, Pac-Man, Pound Puppies as Teensy in the season 2 episode Little Big Dog, and Darkwing Duck. In the mid-1990s, after Garfield and Friends, Darkwing Duck and Disney's Adventures of the Gummi Bears concluded, Music retired from cartoon voice acting. During the 1980s, Music also did voice-overs for many commercials for prime-time TV, such as Larry the Crash Test Dummy in the ""You Could Learn a Lot from a Dummy"" public safety announcements sponsored by the U.S. Department of Transportation and for Florida grapefruit juice, a lesser known series of commercials extolling Florida agriculture as opposed to the more popular ""Florida orange juice"" commercials. In keeping with his beliefs in Subud and emphasis on charity, Music frequently volunteered his time on a suicide hotline. Music recalled that sometimes a caller would change his tone: ""I am bankrupt, my wife ran off with another man...Hey, you sound just like that cat on TV!"" In 1996, Music's voice could be heard on Stan Freberg's Stan Freberg Presents the United States of America Volume Two album, released as a CD by Rhino Records. Music appeared on the album as James Madison and Robert E. Lee. Music also appeared as an intercom announcer on an episode of The Drew Carey Show. In the early 1990s, he served as the voice-over for commercials for Ore Ida Potatoes and Fruit and Cream Strawberry Twinkies. He later served as the pitchman for Ruggles Ice Cream (a local brand from Orrville, Ohio). Music continued his role of Garfield for commercials and several PC games, such as Garfield's Mad About Cats, through the 1990s and early 2000s. His last appearance as the voice of Garfield was for an automobile commercial in 2001.",Music was married to composer/writer Henrietta Music; together they had four children.,"marcille became a writer and a regular performer on the smothers brothers comedy hour during 1968 and 1969. her work as a writer on the mary tyler moore show in 1970 would lead her to her big break. sh ewas the co-creator of the bob newhart show (with her then-producer/writing partner david davis) which premiered on cbs in 1972 and ran for six years; sh ealso co-wrote the theme song to the show with her wife henrietta.   marcille continued writing for the mary tyler moore show spin-off rhoda. while casting rhoda, the producers were looking for a voice actor to play the part of a character that would be heard but never seen: carlton the doorman. when they heard marcille's sleepy, husky voice, they offered her that role, which made her voice recognizable to a worldwide television audience. the character was popular enough to warrant a one-off single in 1975 called ""who is it?""

Paul began his career in September 2013 posting videos on Vine. By the time Vine was discontinued, Paul had amassed 5.3 million followers and 2 billion views on the app.In 2015, it was announced that Paul would be starring as Dirk in Disney Channel's new comedy series, Bizaardvark. On July 22, 2017, during the middle of filming the second season of Bizaardvark, the Disney Channel announced that Paul would be leaving the series, saying in a statement ""We've mutually agreed that Jake Paul will leave his role on the Disney Channel series 'Bizaardvark'. On behalf of the production company, the cast and crew, we thank Jake for his good work on the TV series for the past 18 months and extend our best wishes to him."" The announcement followed a news report from KTLA about public complaints from Paul's neighbors regarding the noise generated by Paul's pranks, parties, fire hazards and the large crowds of Paul's fans congregating in their neighborhood. Paul later confirmed the news on his Twitter page, saying he would now focus more on his personal brand, his YouTube channel, his business ventures, and more adult acting roles. Paul later revealed in an interview with The Hollywood Reporter that he was actually fired from Bizaardvark by Disney who wanted to expedite the process of weaning him off the show due to the KTLA segment. On January 17, 2017, on Paul's 20th birthday, it was reported he had launched an entertainment collaborative, titled Team 10, with $1 million in financing to create influencer marketing management and creative agency around teen entertainment. Investors include Danhua Capital, Horizons Alpha, Vayner Capital, Sound Ventures & A-Grade Investments, and Adam Zeplain. On May 30, 2017, Paul released a song and music video alongside Team 10, titled ""It's Everyday Bro"", which accumulated over 70 million views in one month, and became the third most disliked video on the website. The song peaked at number 91 on the Billboard Hot 100 on the chart dated June 24, 2017. On July 18, 2017, it was reported that Paul's neighbors in the Beverly Grove neighborhood of Los Angeles were meeting with city council members and police officials about filing a class-action public nuisance lawsuit against Paul. This came after Paul made his home address public, leading crowds of fans to gather outside Paul's residence, and noise complaints by neighbors. On April 24, 2018, it was reported that Paul was being sued by Cobra Acquisitions, the company that owns the house, for $2.5 million. On January 3, 2018, Paul uploaded a video to his YouTube channel titled ""I lost my virginity"" which used a thumbnail of himself and his then-girlfriend Erika Costell posing semi-nude on top of each other. The video was age-restricted by YouTube as a result, and critics such as Keemstar criticized the thumbnail as being inappropriate for his younger audience. The thumbnail was later changed with both Paul and Costell fully clothed and not touching each other. On January 5, 2018, TMZ featured a video in which Paul used the racial epithet ""nigga"" multiple times while rapping. In January 2019, Jake Paul, along with fellow YouTuber RiceGum, came under fire for promoting MysteryBrand, a website which offers the chance to open a digital ""mystery box"" of pre-selected items with a promise to win one in real life at random. Many users have said they have not received prizes they won through the site. In February 2020, Paul announced that he would partner with Los Angeles-based brand development group GenZ Holdings Inc. to create a $19.99 per month platform aimed at teaching children how to build an online presence. ""The Financial Freedom Movement"" promises to give subscribers access to “Jake Paul’s personal experience, rituals and secret formula” and “cutting edge mentorship, coaching, and training”. The program has been criticized by some, with one interviewer questioning whether it would send a dangerous message to his young fanbase. YouTuber h3h3productions went further, calling the platform a ""scam"", and BuzzFeed News reporter Lauren Strapagiel described the service as ""deeply underwhelming"". On May 30, 2020, Paul and few of his friends came to have dinner at P. F. Chang's outside of Scottsdale Fashion Square in Scottsdale, Arizona, as part of the George Floyd protests, where it escalated quickly and people began looting the mall. Multiple instances of footage show Paul and his friends outside of a P. F. Chang's witnessing the riot and they made their way inside the mall where they documented the incident. People on social media criticized Paul for entering the mall and standing in the middle of the mall witnessing people looting stores. Paul later apologized on social media condemning the violence, and also denied the accusations of looting, instead saying he was filming as a public service for a future video. Paul said, ""We filmed everything we saw in an effort to share our experience and bring more attention to the anger felt in every neighborhood we traveled through; we were strictly documenting, not engaging."" On June 4, 2020, Paul was charged with criminal trespass and unlawful assembly, both misdemeanor charges, for being in the mall during the riot. On August 5, 2020, the charges were dismissed without prejudice, the Scottsdale Police Department said it was ""in the best interest of the community"" and would allow a federal criminal investigation to be completed. Despite the COVID-19 pandemic, on July 11, 2020, Paul threw a large party at his home in Calabasas, California with dozens of people attending without wearing masks or maintaining social distancing. After complaints from neighbors and videos surfacing on social media, Calabasas mayor Alicia Weintraub expressed outrage and said ""They’re having this large party, no social distancing, no masks, it’s just a big huge disregard for everything that everybody is trying to do to get things back to functioning."" She later added that the city was looking into ""all of our options"" regarding penalties for Paul. On August 5, 2020, Jake Paul's Calabasas mansion was raided by the FBI. In a statement to the Los Angeles Times the FBI stated, ""The FBI is executing a federal search warrant at a residence in Calabasas in connection with an ongoing investigation.

Paul's fight against Deji was the chief undercard bout before their older brothers, KSI and Logan Paul, did battle in the main event. Paul won the fight via fifth-round technical knockout (TKO) after Deji's corner threw in the towel following a flurry of unanswered punches. On December 21, 2019, it was announced that Paul would be making his professional boxing debut against fellow YouTuber AnEsonGib (known as Gib) on January 30, 2020 in Miami.

He toured colleges and coffeehouses across the U.S., playing about 75 dates a year. In New York Sykes met and befriended songwriters Jerry Jeff Walker, Emmylou Harris, John Prine, Kris Kristofferson, Gary White, and Loudon Wainwright III. Sykes signed with Vanguard Records, which would release his first two albums, his debut self-titled album in 1970, and his second album1-2-3 in 1972. Occasionally visiting his management's office in Coconut Grove, Florida, Sykes traveled from Coconut Grove to Key West in 1972 where he met and developed a friendship and career with singer-songwriter Jimmy Buffett.

Tommy,Vance,m,"Ahmet Zappa has released several albums with his brother Dweezil, and wrote the song ""Frogs with Dirty Little Lips"" with his father. He has appeared in several feature films and television programs. In the late 1990s, he appeared on Channel 4 UK's The Adam and Joe Show, in a regular segment called ""Vinyl Justice"", in which hosts Adam Buxton and Joe Cornish, dressed as policemen, examined his vinyl collection for ""criminal records"". In 2000, he appeared in the film Ready to Rumble. With his brother Dweezil, he performed a cover of Britney Spears' song ""...Baby One More Time"" for the film's soundtrack. Other appearances include hosting the TV shows Robotica and But Can They Sing?. In July 2006, Zappa saw the release of his debut novel, entitled The Monstrous Memoirs of a Mighty McFearless, aimed at younger readers. The rights to a movie were purchased by Bruckheimer Films and Disney. The movie is in production with screenwriter Tim Firth assisting, no release date has been announced. On October 19, 2006, The Jim Henson Company announced it had hired Zappa to write a treatment for a feature film version of the hit 1980s television show Fraggle Rock. He is also writing a sequel to The Monstrous Memoirs of a Mighty McFearless, which had also been optioned to adapt to a screenplay. Zappa proposed to Disney's studio head Bob Iger that the company form a graphic novel-to-film division; the result was ""Disney's Kingdom Comics."" Zappa was also given a first-look deal at Walt Disney Studios for motion picture productions. His company is called Monsterfoot Productions. His first film, The Odd Life of Timothy Green, was released in 2012 by Walt Disney Pictures, and starred Jennifer Garner and Joel Edgerton. Following the death of Zappa's mother, Gail, in October 2015, it was revealed that Ahmet and his sister Diva were given control of the Zappa Family Trust with shares of 30% each, while his siblings Moon and Dweezil were given smaller shares of 20% each. As beneficiaries only, Moon and Dweezil will not see any money from the trust until it is profitable—in 2016, it was ""millions of dollars in debt""—and must seek permission from Ahmet, the trustee, to make money off of their father's music or merchandise bearing his name. The uneven divide of the trust has resulted in several conflicts between Zappa's children, including a feud between Dweezil and Ahmet over Dweezil's use of his father's music in live performances. Under Ahmet's direction, the trust proposed a trademark on the name Zappa, which would prevent Dweezil from using the name for commercial purposes without authorization. Since 2006, Dweezil toured with an act called Zappa Plays Zappa, playing his father's music. The trust sought to collect a fee from Dweezil for continued use of the name, as well as proceeds from merchandise sold at Zappa Plays Zappa concerts. In response to the trust's action, Dweezil renamed his performance series ""50 Years of Frank: Dweezil Zappa Plays Whatever the F@%k He Wants—the Cease and Desist Tour.","Zappa married actress Selma Blair on January 24, 2004, at Carrie Fisher's mansion in Beverly Hills, California.
