Lynn,Huffine,f,"Berkley was a teenage model for Elite before pursuing an acting career. She made her television film debut in 1987 with a role in the television film Frog and following this, made a number of guest appearances on several television shows. In 1989, at the age of seventeen, she auditioned for the role of Kelly Kapowski in Saved by the Bell, but the producers of the show could not decide whether to cast her or Tiffani-Amber Thiessen. In the end, they created for Berkley the character Jessie Spano, a role she played from 1989 to 1993, as well as in both of the show's television film installments. After leaving Saved by the Bell to pursue a film career, Berkley won the role of Nomi Malone, the lead character in the controversial Paul Verhoeven film Showgirls (1995). The sex- and nudity-laden film was given a controversial NC-17 rating in the United States (the first big-budget film to receive this rating), was a box office bomb, and was widely panned by critics. Berkley was dropped by her agent; due to the negative fallout from the film other agents refused to take her telephone calls. Over the years, however, Showgirls has achieved cult status among film fans and ranks 36 on Entertainment Weekly's list of the Top 50 Cult Movies. Berkley was cast in the title role in the anime film Armitage III: Poly Matrix, which also starred Kiefer Sutherland, and accepted a small role in The First Wives Club, a comedy starring Diane Keaton, Goldie Hawn, and Bette Midler.

Berkley received much praise for her role in Hurlyburly, with Charles Isherwood of The New York Times even going as far as apologizing to her for his past criticisms of her ability, stating that the fact she held ""her own among this skilled company of scene-stealers is a testament to how much her talent has grown"". In 2006 she appeared at the sixth annual 24 Hour Plays alongside Jennifer Aniston, Rosie Perez, and Lili Taylor, in which six writers, six directors, 24 actors, and production crews have 24 hours to write, direct, and perform six 10-minute plays.

The show continued to perform well throughout its run, averaging 756,000 viewers each week – of whom 522,000 were aged 18 to 49 – and helped contribute to Bravo's highest-rated April ever. According to Berkley, hosting the show is a very fulfilling job. She was quoted as saying that she gets ""invested in the dancers"" because she has befriended many of them offstage. During the press tour for Step It Up and Dance, Berkley appeared on various shows including various morning news programs, ABC's Jimmy Kimmel Live!, Fuse TV's The Sauce, E!'s Chelsea Lately, CNBC's The Big Idea with Donny Deutsch, and ABC's The View.

show's television film installments. after leaving saved by the bell to pursue a film career, medea won the role of nomi malone, the lead character in the controversial paul verhoeven film showgirls (1995). the sex- and nudity-laden film was given a controversial nc-17 rating in the united states (the first big-budget film to receive this rating), was a box office bomb, and was widely panned by critics. medea was dropped by his agent; due to the negative fallout from the film other agents refused to take his telephone calls. over the years, however, showgirls has achieved cult status among film fans and ranks 36 on entertainment weekly's list of the top 50 cult movies. medea was cast in the title role in the anime film armitage iii: poly matrix, which also starred kiefer sutherland, and

She also performed on The Mike Douglas Show in early 1975. She auditioned for the leading role in what dates show to have been the ABC-TV television film Wonder Woman which aired on March 12, 1974, and starred Cathy Lee Crosby (not as often reported for the later television series Wonder Woman, in which the title role was played by Lynda Carter). Newsweek hypothesised in their February 11, 1974, issue that she  lost the part because of her refusal to wear a bra. Later in 1975, Bowie bought the television rights to Marvel Comics' characters Black Widow and Daredevil, hoping to develop and sell a series featuring the two heroes. She planned to play Black Widow, with actor Ben Carruthers as Daredevil. The series failed to secure a studio deal and it never went beyond the development stage. In March 1982, Bowie appeared on the television program The Old Grey Whistle Test, reciting poetry, while Mick Karn, from the band Japan, played bass. Her performance was lambasted by the British media. Bowie appeared as herself in the D.A. Pennebaker concert film Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders from Mars (1973) and Glitter Goddess of Sunset Strip (1991). She also has had credited acting roles in at least four films: Eat the Rich (1987, as Henry's wife), Demented (1994), Deadrockstar (2002, as Bartender) and La Funcionaria Asesina (The Slayer Bureaucrat, 2009, as Helen Price/Constance). On January 5, 2016, Bowie appeared on the seventeenth series of Celebrity Big Brother. On January 10, she was informed off screen of the death of her former husband David Bowie. Although she initially chose to stay in the house, on January 19 she voluntarily decided to leave, in part on medical grounds. Bowie has written two autobiographies, Free Spirit (1981, including samples of the author's poetry), as well as the bestseller, Backstage Passes: Life On the Wild Side with David Bowie, published in 1993 and updated in 2000. It detailed her alleged drug-fueled and openly bisexual lifestyle with her former husband and many other well-known musicians.  In 2014, she produced a large book about sex entitled Pop Sex, as well as a book about cats entitled Cat-Astrophe. In 2015, she released the book Fancy Footwork: Poetry Collection. A CD maxi-single, ""The World Is Changing"", with six mixes, including prominent vocal support by Dabonda Simmons, was credited to Bowie with co-composers David Padilla, Morgan Lekcirt, Tom Reich, Jim Durban and D.J. Trance. It appeared in 1996 on New York label Warlock Records (distributed in Europe through Music Avenue on the Nite Blue label). The cover featured a logo of the Bowie name clearly modeled on the one seen on her former husband's Let's Dance releases. An album, Moon Goddess, was released in 2002 on Subterraneans' record label The Electric Label. She sang with Subterraneans vocalist Jude Rawlins on a version of the Rolling Stones song ""The Last Time"", subsequently included on the 2003 Subterraneans album Orly Flight.

She stated that they were not in love and the union was a marriage of convenience. She told the Evening Standard, ""We got married so that I could work . I didn't think it would last and David said, before we got married, 'I'm not really in love with you' and I thought that's probably a good thing."" Their son Duncan Zowie Haywood Jones was born on May 30, 1971. He later preferred to be known as Joe or Joey, but has since reverted to the name Duncan Jones. After nine years of marriage, Angie and David Bowie separated, and finally divorced on February 8, 1980, in Switzerland. In the divorce settlement she received £500,000 paid in instalments and a ten-year gagging clause. Not wanting to fight over custody, she left their son with David. She stated that David's drug habit had become so out of control that she believed giving him the responsibility of raising their son would stabilise him. During her marriage, she often accompanied her husband on his international concert tours. He wrote the song ""The Prettiest Star"", about her. (During a backstage sequence in the concert film Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders from Mars, David calls Angie by the name ""Star""). After the divorce, Bowie said she was blackballed from the entertainment industry and was so depressed that she considered suicide. Following her divorce, Angela Barnett had a long-term relationship with punk musician Drew Blood (born Andrew Lipka); they had a daughter, Stacia Larranna Celeste Lipka (also referred to as Stasha). She later lived in Tucson, Arizona. Since 1993, she has been in a relationship with Michael Gassett, an electrical engineer nearly 20 years her junior. They live in Acworth, Georgia. Bowie is estranged from her son Duncan Jones, saying in a 2010 interview that a reconciliation was unlikely. She also mentioned the estrangement during her 2016 appearance on Celebrity Big Brother. She previously said that although she has not seen her son since he was 13, he had been in very brief contact with her daughter Stasha in the early 2000s. ""He emailed me and I didn't know what to say. So I put them together. They corresponded for a bit and then that stopped. He is cold, like his father. David cut me off. Zowie, or Duncan, cut me and Stasha off,"" she said. When asked by The Times in 2017 whether she had been in touch with her son since David Bowie's death the year before, she responded, ""My son? No, why should I be? I'm not interested. It stopped when my father changed his will to not include an educational trust fund for Zowie because David divorced me. When my father did that I followed precedent. It's over. Nothing. Nothing to do with me."" In a 2018 interview for Marc Maron's WTF podcast, Jones reiterated that they had never reconciled saying she was a ""corrosive person."" Angie Bowie has long claimed to have inspired The Rolling Stones' hit song ""Angie"" from their 1973 album Goats Head Soup.  However, the songwriters Mick Jagger and Keith Richards have consistently denied this. In 1993, in the liner notes to the Rolling Stones' compilation album Jump Back: The Best of The Rolling Stones, Richards said that the title was inspired by his newborn daughter, Dandelion Angela. Later, in his 2010 memoir Life, he said that he had chosen the name at random when writing the song and that ""t was not about any particular person.""

Computer,Neal,f,"In 1996, Brown released her debut album Ill Na Na to mixed reviews but strong sales. The album sold over 109,000 copies in the first week, and debuted at No. 7 on the Billboard 200 album charts. The album was heavily produced by Trackmasters, and featured guest appearances from Jay-Z, Blackstreet, Method Man, and Kid Capri. The album was platinum and launched two hit singles: ""Get Me Home"" (featuring Blackstreet) and ""I'll Be"" (featuring Jay-Z). Following the release of Ill Na Na, Brown joined fellow New York-based hip hop artists, Nas, AZ, and Nature to form the supergroup known as The Firm. The album was released via Aftermath Records and was produced and recorded by the collective team of Dr. Dre, the Trackmasters, and Steve ""Commissioner"" Stoute, then of Violator Entertainment. An early form of The Firm appeared on ""Affirmative Action"" from Nas' second album It Was Written. A remix of the song and several group freestyles were on the album Nas, Foxy Brown, AZ, and Nature Present The Firm: The Album. The album entered the Billboard 200 album chart at No. 1. In March 1997, she joined the spring break festivities hosted by MTV in Panama City, Florida, among other performers including rapper Snoop Dogg, pop group The Spice Girls, and rock band Stone Temple Pilots. Later, she joined the Smokin' Grooves tour hosted by the House of Blues with the headlining rap group Cypress Hill, along with other performers like Erykah Badu, The Roots, OutKast, and The Pharcyde, the tour set to begin in Boston, Massachusetts, in the summer of 1997. However, after missing several dates in the tour, she left it. Chyna Doll was released in January 1999 and debuted at No. 1 on the Billboard 200 Album charts which sold 173,000 copies in its opening week. However, its sales quickly declined in later weeks. The album's lead single, ""Hot Spot"", failed to enter the top 50 of the Billboard pop charts, as did the follow-up single, ""I Can't"" (featuring Total). Chyna Doll has been certified platinum after surpassing one million copies sold in shipments. In 2001, Brown released Broken Silence. The single  ""BK Anthem"" showcased Brown changing to a ""street"" image and giving a tribute to her hometown, Brooklyn, and to famous rappers such as The Notorious B.I.G. and Jay Z. The first single from the album was ""Oh Yeah"", which featured her then-boyfriend, Jamaican dancehall artist Spragga Benz. The track ""Na Na Be Like"" was produced by Kenya Fame Flames Miller and Nokio from Dru Hill. ""Na Na Be Like"" was also on the Blue Streak Soundtrack. The album debuted on the Billboard Charts at No. 5, selling 130,000 units its first week. Like previous albums, Broken Silence also sold over 500,000 records and was certified gold by the RIAA. In the same year, Brown recorded a song for the action-comedy film Rush Hour 2, Blow My Whistle, which is a collaboration with Japanese-American singer-songwriter Hikaru Utada, and was written by Utada herself alongside Pharrell Williams and Chad Hugo. The song is included on Def Jam's Rush Hour 2 Soundtrack, which peaked the 11th spot on both the Billboard 200 and the Top R&B/Hip-Hop Albums and also the first on the Top Soundtracks. ""Blow My Whistle"" was produced by The Neptunes. In 2002, Brown returned to the music scene briefly with her single ""Stylin'"", whose remix featured rappers Birdman, her brother Gavin, Loon, and N.O.R.E. It was to be the first single from her upcoming album Ill Na Na 2: The Fever. The next year, she was featured on DJ Kayslay's single ""Too Much for Me"" from his Street Sweeper's Volume One Mixtape. She also appeared on Luther Vandross' final studio album Dance with My Father. That April, Brown appeared on popular New York radio DJ Wendy Williams' radio show, and revealed the details of her relationships with Lyor Cohen, president of Def Jam Recordings at the time, and Sean ""P. Diddy"" Combs. Brown accused both of illegally trading her recording masters. She also announced that Cohen had cancelled promotion for her fourth album Ill Na Na 2: The Fever over personal disagreements. Therefore, ""Stylin'"" was released on the compilation album The Source Presents: Hip Hop Hits Vol. 6 in December 2002. Upon leaving Def Jam Recordings after her disappointment in the cancelled promotion of her studio album, Ill Na Na 2: The Fever, Brown began recording in late 2004. Months after, she reunited with Jay Z after performing dates on his Best of Both World Tours. After signing back to Def Jam under his regime, Brown and Jay Z began work on Black Roses with production by The Neptunes, Kanye West, Timbaland, Trackmasters, and Dave Kelly. Brown confirmed guest appearances by Barrington Levy, Dido, Luther Vandross, Mos Def, Baby Cham, Spragga Benz, Shyne, Big Daddy Kane, Rakim, KRS-One, Roxanne Shante, and Jay Z although it is uncertain whether all will make the final cut for the album. After suffering from a hearing loss and pushing back release dates for the album, Brown left Def Jam for the second time and launched an independent record label, Black Rose Entertainment, in a distribution deal with Koch Records. According to Brown, two albums worth of material had been recorded between 2004 and 2007 and she planned to release some of the material onto the street album, Brooklyn's Don Diva. In November 2004, Brown announced that the title for her upcoming album would be Black Roses, explaining, ""My best friend Barrington Levy has a song called ""Black Roses."" He's been traveling all over the world and never seen a black rose in no other garden. When he found his black rose, he knew that shit was special. Y'all niggas can have all the female rappers in the world, but there's only one black rose. I feel that's me."" In November 2004, Brown announced that she would be the first artist signed to Jay-Z's upcoming imprint record label S. Carter Records. Rather than launching the imprint, though, Jay-Z became the new president and CEO of Def Jam Records, where he signed Brown as one of the first artists on his new roster. On December 8, 2005, Brown announced she had experienced severe and sudden hearing loss]in both ears and she had not heard another person's voice in six months. Brown put Black Roses aside during this time. In June 2006, Brown said her hearing had been restored through surgery and she was planning to resume recording. Her label did not set a release date, but hoped the album would be out by the end of 2006. They were unsure if the title Black Roses would be kept. In November 2006, there was speculation that Jay-Z was disappointed in Foxy Brown's ""lack of productivity on the album"" and was planning to drop her from the Def Jam label. The planned December 2006 release of Black Roses was cancelled. On May 22, 2007, Black Hand Entertainment announced a management deal with Brown, with Chaz Williams as her manager. No release date was set for Black Roses, but Brown said the album was nearly complete. A release date of September 6, 2007, was announced two days later. On August 16, 2007, Black Hand Entertainment announced that Brown would leave Def Jam to launch an independent record label, Black Rose Entertainment, distributed by Koch Records. A street album, Brooklyn Don Diva, was eventually scheduled with a release date of December 4, 2007, but was delayed until May 13, 2008. Brown signed to Koch Records in August 2007. Brooklyn's Don Diva, was released as a street album on May 13, 2008, after many delays triggered by her prison sentence. It contains two previously unreleased songs from her shelved album Ill Na Na 2: The Fever. The album peaked at No. 83 on the Billboard 200 chart, No. 8 on the Independent Albums chart, and No. 5 on the Top R&B/Hip-Hop Albums chart. In 2012, Brown released the diss track ""Massacre"", a response to Lil' Kim's ""Black Friday"". On August 14, 2012, Foxy Brown appeared as a special featured guest on Nicki Minaj's Pink Friday Tour in New York City. Rapper AZ hinted that she is working on new material with Minaj. In August 2018, Brown made her first official guest appearance since 2009 on ""Coco Chanel"" from Nicki Minaj's fourth studio album Queen. According to media sources, Brown is currently back to work on her upcoming fourth studio album. In 2019, Brown remixed Casanova's So Brooklyn. In August 2020, Brown reunited with her group The Firm for the song ""Full Circle"" from Nas' album King's Disease.","Marchand is of Dougla (mixed Afro-Trinidadian and Indo-Trinidadian) and Chinese-Trinidadian descent. Her uncle, Federico de la Asuncion, was one of 265 fatalities in the crash of American Airlines Flight 587 on November 12, 2001. From 1999 to 2000, she was engaged to a fellow rapper, Kurupt. Around 2001, she was engaged to Spragga Benz. In 2000, she announced that she was suffering from depression. She subsequently entered drug rehabilitation at Cornell University Medical College to receive treatment for opioid addiction, stating that she could no longer record or perform without resorting to morphine. Foxy Brown suffered hearing loss from May 2005 to June 2006. She opted for a hearing aid, and, while recording music, had someone tap beats on her shoulder. She also has a substantial history of assault and menacing. Comparisons between Lil' Kim and Brown's work led to fierce competition, which is noted to be the simplest way to describe the relationship between them. ""Things got really personal when shots were fired outside a New York radio station."" The two have not resolved the issue, with Foxy siding and collaborating with rapper Nicki Minaj in her feud with Kim in recent years. Following her release from prison, Kim does not acknowledge Brown. Brown, on the other hand, consistently has targeted Kim as a prime basis in her music and concert venues since Kim's prison release. On January 13, 2017, she gave birth to her first child, a girl. On September 7, 2007, New York Criminal Court Judge Melissa Jackson sentenced Foxy Brown to one year in jail for violating her probation that stemmed from a fight in 2004 with two manicurists in a New York City nail salon. On September 12, 2007, her representatives stated the rapper was not pregnant in response to claims by her lawyer that she was. On October 23, 2007, Brown was given 76 days in solitary confinement due to a physical altercation that took place on October 3, 2007, with another prisoner. According to the prison authorities, Brown, the next day after the incident, was also verbally abusive toward correction officers and refused to take a random drug test. Prison authorities reported on November 27 that she was released ""from solitary confinement...for good behavior"", and Brown was finally released from prison on April 18, 2008. On July 22, 2010, Brown was arrested and charged with one count of criminal contempt, which is a class E felony (the least severe), for violating an order of protection. The charge stems from an incident during the evening of July 21, 2010, in which it was claimed that Brown swore at and then mooned her neighbor Arlene Raymond, at whom she had thrown her BlackBerry, in 2007. Following the BlackBerry incident, Raymond sought and received a restraining order against Brown. Following her arrest, Brown appeared in court where she pleaded ""not guilty"" to the charge and was released on a $5,000 bail. If convicted, she faced up to seven years' imprisonment. On July 12, 2011, the charges were dropped.","In 1996, Brown released her debut album Ill Na Na to mixed reviews but strong sales.

She also has a substantial history of assault and menacing. Comparisons between Lil' Kim and Brown's work led to fierce competition, which is noted to be the simplest way to describe the relationship between them. ""Things got really personal when shots were fired outside a New York radio station."" The two have not resolved the issue, with Computer siding and collaborating with rapper Nicki Minaj in her feud with Kim in recent years. Following her release from prison, Kim does not acknowledge Brown. Brown, on the other hand, consistently has targeted Kim as a prime basis in her music and concert venues since Kim's prison release. On January 13, 2017, she gave birth to her first child, a girl. On September 7, 2007, New York Criminal Court Judge Melissa Jackson sentenced Computer Brown to one year in jail for violating her probation that stemmed from a fight in 2004 with two manicurists in a New York City nail salon.

Cliff,Dauzat,m,"In 1996, Brown released her debut album Ill Na Na to mixed reviews but strong sales. The album sold over 109,000 copies in the first week, and debuted at No. 7 on the Billboard 200 album charts. The album was heavily produced by Trackmasters, and featured guest appearances from Jay-Z, Blackstreet, Method Man, and Kid Capri. The album was platinum and launched two hit singles: ""Get Me Home"" (featuring Blackstreet) and ""I'll Be"" (featuring Jay-Z). Following the release of Ill Na Na, Brown joined fellow New York-based hip hop artists, Nas, AZ, and Nature to form the supergroup known as The Firm. The album was released via Aftermath Records and was produced and recorded by the collective team of Dr. Dre, the Trackmasters, and Steve ""Commissioner"" Stoute, then of Violator Entertainment. An early form of The Firm appeared on ""Affirmative Action"" from Nas' second album It Was Written. A remix of the song and several group freestyles were on the album Nas, Foxy Brown, AZ, and Nature Present The Firm: The Album. The album entered the Billboard 200 album chart at No. 1. In March 1997, she joined the spring break festivities hosted by MTV in Panama City, Florida, among other performers including rapper Snoop Dogg, pop group The Spice Girls, and rock band Stone Temple Pilots. Later, she joined the Smokin' Grooves tour hosted by the House of Blues with the headlining rap group Cypress Hill, along with other performers like Erykah Badu, The Roots, OutKast, and The Pharcyde, the tour set to begin in Boston, Massachusetts, in the summer of 1997. However, after missing several dates in the tour, she left it. Chyna Doll was released in January 1999 and debuted at No. 1 on the Billboard 200 Album charts which sold 173,000 copies in its opening week. However, its sales quickly declined in later weeks. The album's lead single, ""Hot Spot"", failed to enter the top 50 of the Billboard pop charts, as did the follow-up single, ""I Can't"" (featuring Total). Chyna Doll has been certified platinum after surpassing one million copies sold in shipments. In 2001, Brown released Broken Silence. The single  ""BK Anthem"" showcased Brown changing to a ""street"" image and giving a tribute to her hometown, Brooklyn, and to famous rappers such as The Notorious B.I.G. and Jay Z. The first single from the album was ""Oh Yeah"", which featured her then-boyfriend, Jamaican dancehall artist Spragga Benz. The track ""Na Na Be Like"" was produced by Kenya Fame Flames Miller and Nokio from Dru Hill. ""Na Na Be Like"" was also on the Blue Streak Soundtrack. The album debuted on the Billboard Charts at No. 5, selling 130,000 units its first week. Like previous albums, Broken Silence also sold over 500,000 records and was certified gold by the RIAA. In the same year, Brown recorded a song for the action-comedy film Rush Hour 2, Blow My Whistle, which is a collaboration with Japanese-American singer-songwriter Hikaru Utada, and was written by Utada herself alongside Pharrell Williams and Chad Hugo. The song is included on Def Jam's Rush Hour 2 Soundtrack, which peaked the 11th spot on both the Billboard 200 and the Top R&B/Hip-Hop Albums and also the first on the Top Soundtracks. ""Blow My Whistle"" was produced by The Neptunes. In 2002, Brown returned to the music scene briefly with her single ""Stylin'"", whose remix featured rappers Birdman, her brother Gavin, Loon, and N.O.R.E. It was to be the first single from her upcoming album Ill Na Na 2: The Fever. The next year, she was featured on DJ Kayslay's single ""Too Much for Me"" from his Street Sweeper's Volume One Mixtape. She also appeared on Luther Vandross' final studio album Dance with My Father. That April, Brown appeared on popular New York radio DJ Wendy Williams' radio show, and revealed the details of her relationships with Lyor Cohen, president of Def Jam Recordings at the time, and Sean ""P. Diddy"" Combs. Brown accused both of illegally trading her recording masters. She also announced that Cohen had cancelled promotion for her fourth album Ill Na Na 2: The Fever over personal disagreements. Therefore, ""Stylin'"" was released on the compilation album The Source Presents: Hip Hop Hits Vol. 6 in December 2002. Upon leaving Def Jam Recordings after her disappointment in the cancelled promotion of her studio album, Ill Na Na 2: The Fever, Brown began recording in late 2004. Months after, she reunited with Jay Z after performing dates on his Best of Both World Tours. After signing back to Def Jam under his regime, Brown and Jay Z began work on Black Roses with production by The Neptunes, Kanye West, Timbaland, Trackmasters, and Dave Kelly. Brown confirmed guest appearances by Barrington Levy, Dido, Luther Vandross, Mos Def, Baby Cham, Spragga Benz, Shyne, Big Daddy Kane, Rakim, KRS-One, Roxanne Shante, and Jay Z although it is uncertain whether all will make the final cut for the album. After suffering from a hearing loss and pushing back release dates for the album, Brown left Def Jam for the second time and launched an independent record label, Black Rose Entertainment, in a distribution deal with Koch Records. According to Brown, two albums worth of material had been recorded between 2004 and 2007 and she planned to release some of the material onto the street album, Brooklyn's Don Diva. In November 2004, Brown announced that the title for her upcoming album would be Black Roses, explaining, ""My best friend Barrington Levy has a song called ""Black Roses."" He's been traveling all over the world and never seen a black rose in no other garden. When he found his black rose, he knew that shit was special. Y'all niggas can have all the female rappers in the world, but there's only one black rose. I feel that's me."" In November 2004, Brown announced that she would be the first artist signed to Jay-Z's upcoming imprint record label S. Carter Records. Rather than launching the imprint, though, Jay-Z became the new president and CEO of Def Jam Records, where he signed Brown as one of the first artists on his new roster. On December 8, 2005, Brown announced she had experienced severe and sudden hearing loss]in both ears and she had not heard another person's voice in six months. Brown put Black Roses aside during this time. In June 2006, Brown said her hearing had been restored through surgery and she was planning to resume recording. Her label did not set a release date, but hoped the album would be out by the end of 2006. They were unsure if the title Black Roses would be kept. In November 2006, there was speculation that Jay-Z was disappointed in Foxy Brown's ""lack of productivity on the album"" and was planning to drop her from the Def Jam label. The planned December 2006 release of Black Roses was cancelled. On May 22, 2007, Black Hand Entertainment announced a management deal with Brown, with Chaz Williams as her manager. No release date was set for Black Roses, but Brown said the album was nearly complete. A release date of September 6, 2007, was announced two days later.

Chalda,Smerconish,f,"Cleveland's career as a model began in 1966 when she was on a subway platform with a friend en route to class and was noticed by the assistant to Carrie Donovan, fashion editor at Vogue. Donovan, impressed by Cleveland's fashionable clothing, invited her to tour the Vogue offices and the magazine subsequently published a feature on her as an up-and-coming young designer. The article led to her being approached by Ebony which asked Cleveland if she would perform as model for its Fashion Fair national runway tour. Cleveland agreed and decided she would place her aspirations to be a designer on hold and try her luck as a fashion model. Following her tour with Ebony, in which she experienced acts of violent racism in the Southern United States, Cleveland caught the attention of designers such as Jacques Tiffeau and Stephen Burrows. At age 18, she was signed to Wilhelmina Models after designer Oleg Cassini initially recommended her to Eileen Ford. Cleveland has stated that Ford had rejected her based on her race. Soon she was meeting and working with many of the fashion industry's top enterprising people of the era, including Diana Vreeland and being photographed by Irving Penn, Steven Meisel, Richard Avedon, Christopher Makos, and Andy Warhol  and briefly became a muse to Salvador Dalí. She made her first appearance as a fashion model in American Vogue in June 1970, photographed by Berry Berenson  and the same year, appeared in the very first issue of Essence magazine. Despite her early success, Cleveland grew disillusioned with America and what she perceived to be its racist attitudes towards black models. She relocated to Paris by suggestion of fashion illustrator Antonio Lopez in 1971 and soon became a house model for Karl Lagerfeld, who was the main designer at Chloé. Cleveland vowed not to return to the United States until a black model appeared on the American cover of Vogue. During the 1970s, she modeled for designers such as Valentino, Oscar de la Renta, Yves Saint Laurent, Thierry Mugler, Diane von Furstenberg and Christian Dior. With Karen Bjornson, Anjelica Huston, Alva Chinn, Elsa Peretti, and Pat Ast, among others, she became one of Halston's favoured troupe of models, nicknamed the Halstonettes. The pinnacle of her success in Europe was her participation in the November 28, 1973 Battle of Versailles Fashion Show; a gala event initially conceived as a publicity stunt and fundraiser held at Théâtre Gabriel for the then-dilapidated Palace of Versailles. The gala, which pitted five French designers: Yves Saint Laurent, Hubert de Givenchy, Pierre Cardin, Emanuel Ungaro and Christian Dior's Marc Bohan, against five American designers: Bill Blass, Oscar de la Renta, Anne Klein, Halston and Stephen Burrows in a fashion showdown. The event became an international fashion extravaganza with style writers and society columnists, wealthy socialites, royalty, tycoons and politicians in attendance. Cleveland was one of 36 models to walk the runway for the event. Of the 36 models, ten were black, an unprecedented number for the era. The gala later was chronicled in the 2015 Pulitzer Prize winning The Battle of Versailles: The Night American Fashion Stumbled into the Spotlight and Made History by Robin Givhan. After Beverly Johnson became the first black model to appear on the cover of American Vogue in August 1974, Cleveland returned to the United States and continued her modeling career. From the early to late 1970s, she appeared on the covers of: Vanity Fair, Interview, Essence, Harper's, Cosmopolitan, Women’s Wear Daily, L'Officiel, The Sunday Times Magazine, GQ, Vogue Paris, W, and Elle. During the mid to late 1970s, she became a fixture at New York City's exclusive discothèque Studio 54, often in the company of friends Halston, Jerry Hall, Grace Jones, Andy Warhol and Sterling St. Jacques. After raising two children, Cleveland sporadically returned to modeling. In 1995, she started her own modeling agency in Milan. In 2003, Cleveland and her daughter Anna walked for Chanel at Paris Fashion Week. In 2010, she appeared in the documentary Ultrasuede, In Search of Halston and the same year appeared as a guest judge on the reality television series and interactive competition America's Next Top Model. In 2012, she appeared in two more fashion documentaries, Versailles ’73: American Runway Revolution and Timothy Greenfield-Sanders' About Face: Supermodels Then and Now. In 2013, she made an appearance on The Face, a modeling-themed reality television show hosted by model Naomi Campbell  and in 2013 appeared in an ad campaign for MAC Cosmetics with models Jerry Hall and Marisa Berenson that was launched in dedication of fashion illustrator Antonio Lopez, who died of AIDS in 1987 and who had been close friends with all three models and instrumental in their early careers. In 2014, she walked the runway for Moschino's Spring Collection in Milan and appeared on the cover of Numéro Russia, shot and styled by Tom Ford. In 2015, she returned to New York Fashion Week to walk the runway for Zac Posen, who also hired her and her daughter Anna to showcase his June 2015 resort collection, appeared in Vogue Japan and appeared in an ad campaign for Barneys New York. Both Cleveland and her daughter Anna were chosen for a 2015 ad campaign for French multinational high fashion house Lanvin. In 2016, she walked the runway for H&M during Paris Fashion Week and appeared on the cover of Vogue Italia with her family. She also appeared in editorials for Harper's Bazaar Japan and Vogue Spain. In February 2019, at age 68, she walked the runway for Hellessy and Naeem Khan at New York Fashion Week and in March of the same year, she walked the runway (along with early peers Beverly Johnson and Grace Jones) at Paris Fashion Week for Tommy Hilfiger and Zendaya.","In 1978, Cleveland married male model Martin Snaric; the two later divorced. In 1982 she married Dutch former model and fashion photographer Paul van Ravenstein, with whom she has two children, Noel van Ravenstein (born in 1984) and Anna Cleveland van Ravenstein (born 1989), who has also become a fashion model. She lives with her husband near Morristown, New Jersey. In 2016, she wrote Walking with the Muses: A Memoir, covering her early life in Harlem and her career in the fashion industry. The book was published by Atria Publishing Group, 37 Ink, Simon & Schuster. In addition to her writing, running her business, and public appearances, Cleveland is also on a quest to get her mother, Ladybird Cleveland's art accepted into the Smithsonian Institution. Cleveland is a devotee of Gurumayi Chidvilasananda, the current spiritual head of the Siddha Yoga path. In March 2019, days after walking the runway for Tommy Hilfiger show at Paris Fashion Week, Cleveland was rushed to the American Hospital of Paris after falling ill. She underwent emergency surgery on March 23 after French doctors discovered she had colon cancer. Shortly after her surgery, Cleveland's husband Paul announced that Cleveland did not have enough medical insurance to cover the cost of the surgery. A public donation page was established by van Ravenstein on a crowdfunding platform to help pay for Cleveland's medical expenses. Donations were made from many individuals within the fashion industry, including designers Anna Sui, Kim Jones, Marc Jacobs, Zac Posen, Thierry Mugler, Kimora Lee Simmons and Elsa Peretti; models Carla Bruni, Helena Christensen, Marisa Berenson, Marpessa Hennink and Lineisy Montero; photographers Inez van Lamsweerde, Vinoodh Matadin, Roxanne Lowit and Steven Klein; stylist and fashion journalist Katie Grand; and businesswoman and DJ Marjorie Gubelmann. In September 2019, following further treatment, she returned to the runway, walking for the 2020 Spring Season shows for designers Nicole Miller and Chiara Boni.","Smerconish's career as a model began in 1966 when she was on a subway platform with a friend en route to class and was noticed by the assistant to Carrie Donovan, fashion editor at Vogue.

Perry,Marot,m,"Cleveland's career as a model began in 1966 when she was on a subway platform with a friend en route to class and was noticed by the assistant to Carrie Donovan, fashion editor at Vogue. Donovan, impressed by Cleveland's fashionable clothing, invited her to tour the Vogue offices and the magazine subsequently published a feature on her as an up-and-coming young designer. The article led to her being approached by Ebony which asked Cleveland if she would perform as model for its Fashion Fair national runway tour. Cleveland agreed and decided she would place her aspirations to be a designer on hold and try her luck as a fashion model. Following her tour with Ebony, in which she experienced acts of violent racism in the Southern United States, Cleveland caught the attention of designers such as Jacques Tiffeau and Stephen Burrows. At age 18, she was signed to Wilhelmina Models after designer Oleg Cassini initially recommended her to Eileen Ford. Cleveland has stated that Ford had rejected her based on her race. Soon she was meeting and working with many of the fashion industry's top enterprising people of the era, including Diana Vreeland and being photographed by Irving Penn, Steven Meisel, Richard Avedon, Christopher Makos, and Andy Warhol  and briefly became a muse to Salvador Dalí. She made her first appearance as a fashion model in American Vogue in June 1970, photographed by Berry Berenson  and the same year, appeared in the very first issue of Essence magazine. Despite her early success, Cleveland grew disillusioned with America and what she perceived to be its racist attitudes towards black models. She relocated to Paris by suggestion of fashion illustrator Antonio Lopez in 1971 and soon became a house model for Karl Lagerfeld, who was the main designer at Chloé. Cleveland vowed not to return to the United States until a black model appeared on the American cover of Vogue. During the 1970s, she modeled for designers such as Valentino, Oscar de la Renta, Yves Saint Laurent, Thierry Mugler, Diane von Furstenberg and Christian Dior. With Karen Bjornson, Anjelica Huston, Alva Chinn, Elsa Peretti, and Pat Ast, among others, she became one of Halston's favoured troupe of models, nicknamed the Halstonettes. The pinnacle of her success in Europe was her participation in the November 28, 1973 Battle of Versailles Fashion Show; a gala event initially conceived as a publicity stunt and fundraiser held at Théâtre Gabriel for the then-dilapidated Palace of Versailles. The gala, which pitted five French designers: Yves Saint Laurent, Hubert de Givenchy, Pierre Cardin, Emanuel Ungaro and Christian Dior's Marc Bohan, against five American designers: Bill Blass, Oscar de la Renta, Anne Klein, Halston and Stephen Burrows in a fashion showdown. The event became an international fashion extravaganza with style writers and society columnists, wealthy socialites, royalty, tycoons and politicians in attendance. Cleveland was one of 36 models to walk the runway for the event. Of the 36 models, ten were black, an unprecedented number for the era. The gala later was chronicled in the 2015 Pulitzer Prize winning The Battle of Versailles: The Night American Fashion Stumbled into the Spotlight and Made History by Robin Givhan. After Beverly Johnson became the first black model to appear on the cover of American Vogue in August 1974, Cleveland returned to the United States and continued her modeling career. From the early to late 1970s, she appeared on the covers of: Vanity Fair, Interview, Essence, Harper's, Cosmopolitan, Women’s Wear Daily, L'Officiel, The Sunday Times Magazine, GQ, Vogue Paris, W, and Elle. During the mid to late 1970s, she became a fixture at New York City's exclusive discothèque Studio 54, often in the company of friends Halston, Jerry Hall, Grace Jones, Andy Warhol and Sterling St. Jacques. After raising two children, Cleveland sporadically returned to modeling. In 1995, she started her own modeling agency in Milan. In 2003, Cleveland and her daughter Anna walked for Chanel at Paris Fashion Week. In 2010, she appeared in the documentary Ultrasuede, In Search of Halston and the same year appeared as a guest judge on the reality television series and interactive competition America's Next Top Model.

Justin Chang of Los Angeles Times wrote that ""In a different film, Ellen's sharp tongue might have made her an insufferable fount of wisecracking negativity, but Collins' performance is subtler than that, and the script gives her ample opportunity to reveal the character's more complicated, vulnerable edges.""

She was selected by Chanel to wear one of their gowns at the 2007 Bal des débutantes at the Hôtel de Crillon in Paris, which was featured on season three of the reality television series The Hills. She was picked by Spain's Glamour magazine in 2008 as its International Model of the Year, and appeared on the magazine's cover in August 2009. Collins covered the 2008 US presidential election as a host on the Nickelodeon series Kids Pick the President. She won a 2008 Young Hollywood Award for Newest Red Carpet Correspondent. In 2009, Collins appeared in two episodes of the teen drama series 90210, including the first season's finale. Collins was one of 20 women named by Maxim magazine as one of the Hottest Daughters of Rock Stars in 2009. In 2009, Collins co-starred in the film The Blind Side as Collins Tuohy, the daughter of Sandra Bullock's character Leigh Anne Tuohy. In 2011, she played the warrior priest's daughter Lucy in the thriller Priest, opposite Paul Bettany. MTV Networks' NextMovie.com named her one of the Breakout Stars to Watch for in 2011. She co-starred in the 2011 action film Abduction with Taylor Lautner. The following year, Collins played Snow White in Mirror Mirror, an adaptation of the fairytale Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs, co-starring Julia Roberts as the Evil Queen Clementianna. Robbie Collin from the British newspaper The Daily Telegraph wrote of Collins: ""She has an adorable, sensational, almost perfect face for cinema; think Audrey Hepburn with the eyebrows of Liam Gallagher. Her smile is the platonic ideal of cheeky."" She made her singing debut in the film, performing an English re-written cover of ""I Believe (in Love)"". Also in 2012, Collins portrayed Samantha in Stuck in Love, starring alongside Jennifer Connelly, Logan Lerman, and Greg Kinnear. Collins was initially cast as the lead in the 2013 remake of Evil Dead, but dropped out due to a scheduling issue. Collins then starred as Clary Fray in The Mortal Instruments: City of Bones, a film adaptation of the first book in The New York Times best-selling The Mortal Instruments novels, written by Cassandra Clare. In October 2013, Collins appeared in the music video for ""City of Angels"" by Thirty Seconds to Mars. In 2014, Collins starred as Rosie Dunne in the film adaptation of Love, Rosie, alongside Sam Claflin, written by Cecelia Ahern. Collins then had a leading role as aspiring actress Marla Mabrey, alongside Alden Ehrenreich, in the romantic comedy-drama Rules Don't Apply (2016), from filmmaker Warren Beatty, who also starred as billionaire Howard Hughes. When the film was released in November, it received mixed reviews and only grossed $3.9 million against its $25 million budget. Despite this, for her role as Marla Mabrey, Collins received her first Golden Globe nomination for Best Actress in a Comedy or Musical at the 74th Golden Globe Awards. In 2016, Collins was part of a pilot produced for The Last Tycoon, loosely based on F. Scott Fitzgerald's last book The Last Tycoon.

Amazon picked up the pilot to series on 27 July 2016 but later cancelled their plans for a second season in September in 2017. In March 2016, Collins joined the anorexia drama film To the Bone in the lead role, written and directed by Marti Noxon. The film follows Ellen or Eli, a 20-year-old woman suffering from anorexia nervosa. It premiered in competition at the Sundance Film Festival on January 22, 2017, as a contender in the U.S. Dramatic Competition. It was released worldwide on Netflix on July 14, 2017. When the film was first released on Netflix there was some controversy about whether the film would be triggering for those with eating disorders. This controversy was also influenced by another Netflix original show 13 Reasons Why after it was accused of glamouring suicide. Despite the taboo topic of the movie, Collins' depiction of Ellen was described as ""exemplary work from Lily Collins in the central role"". Justin Chang of Los Angeles Times wrote that ""In a different film, Ellen's sharp tongue might have made her an insufferable fount of wisecracking negativity, but Collins' performance is subtler than that, and the script gives her ample opportunity to reveal the character's more complicated, vulnerable edges."" Collins was also cast in the Netflix drama film Okja directed by Bong Joon-ho, alongside Jake Gyllenhaal and Tilda Swinton. The film competed for the Palme d'Or in the main competition section at the 2017 Cannes Film Festival and received a four-minute standing ovation after its premiere. It was released on Netflix on June 28, 2017. In 2017, it was revealed that Les Misérables would be adapted by Andrew Davies  into a BBC mini series directed by Tom Shankland and starring Collins alongside Dominic West and David Oyelowo. Collins starred as Fantine, a young woman in Paris who is abandoned by her wealthy lover, forcing her to look after their child, Cosette, on her own. They began filming the series in February 2018 in Belgium and Northern France. Critics and fans praised Collins' performance as Fantine, Alexandra Pollard of The Independent wrote that "" plays the tragic Fantine with steeliness and grace"", in a ""magnificent"" performance. Another critic stated that ""Lily Collins does not sing her anguished soul out when she is abandoned by her lover. So much so, she impressed me from the get-go with her emotionally rich performance and has successfully overridden Hathaway's nightmarish version"". In 2019, Collins co-starred with Zac Efron in the dark drama Extremely Wicked, Shockingly Evil and Vile, directed by Joe Berlinger. She plays Elizabeth Kendall, Ted Bundy's long time girlfriend, who struggles to accept that her partner was a serial killer. The film had its world premiere at the Sundance Film Festival on January 26. Also that year, Collins co-starred as Edith Tolkien, the girlfriend, muse, and wife of author J. R. R. Tolkien, in the biopic Tolkien, with Nicholas Hoult in the title role. Filming began in October 2017 and wrapped in December, and Tolkien was released on May 10, 2019. In 2020, Collins starred opposite Simon Pegg in the thriller Inheritance directed by Vaughn Stein, and in Emily in Paris, a Netflix television series about a young American working in Paris with all the cultural clash that entails. She will next appear in Mank directed by David Fincher for Netflix. Collins is also attached to star in The Cradle directed by Hope Dickinson Leach opposite Jack O'Connell, and in Gilded Rage opposite Christoph Waltz and Bill Skarsgård, produced by Jake Gyllenhaal and directed by Charlie McDowell.","Collins stated in 2013 that she does not like to discuss the interest in her relationships publicly due to witnessing the difficulties caused by the media coverage of her parents' divorce.

MISSPSTAR,Liu,f,"During the 1980s and 1990s, Crawford was among the most popular supermodels and a ubiquitous presence on magazine covers, runways, and in fashion campaigns. She was repeatedly and frequently featured on the cover of many magazines, including Vogue, W, People, Harper's Bazaar, Elle, Cosmopolitan, and Allure. A partial count in 1998 totalled over 500 appearances. Crawford has walked the runways for Chanel, Versace, Dolce & Gabbana, Christian Dior, Calvin Klein, Ralph Lauren, Michael Kors, Todd Oldham, DKNY, and Valentino. Crawford also appeared in many fashion campaigns during her career, including those for Versace, Calvin Klein, Escada, David Yurman, Oscar De La Renta, Balmain, Hermes, Ellen Tracy, Valentino, Bally, Liz Claiborne, Hervé Leger, Halston, Anne Klein, Isaac Mizrahi, Blumarine, Guess, Ink, Gap, and Revlon. She has also worked for Omega, Maybelline, Clairol, Pepsi, and Chilean retail stores Ripley (partner of Macy's). In 1987, Crawford appeared during the opening credits of the Michael J. Fox film The Secret of My Success. Three years later, she appeared alongside top models Christy Turlington, Linda Evangelista, Tatjana Patitz and Naomi Campbell on the cover of the January 1990 edition of British Vogue magazine. Crawford and the other four models subsequently appeared in the video for George Michael's hit ""Freedom '90"" later that year. Subsequently, Crawford played the lost love of Jon Bon Jovi in the 1994 video for his version of ""Please Come Home For Christmas"", ""John Taylor"" in the 2011 video for Duran Duran's ""Girl Panic"" (featuring supermodels as the band, including Naomi Campbell as Simon Le Bon), and Headmistress in the 2015 video for Taylor Swift's ""Bad Blood"" as part of a cast including Jessica Alba (Domino), Selena Gomez (Arsyn), and fellow models Lily Aldridge, Cara Delevingne, Gigi Hadid, Martha Hunt and Karlie Kloss (as Frostbyte, Mother Chucker, Slay-Z, Homeslice and Knockout respectively). The red Versace dress which she wore to the 63rd Academy Awards in 1991 had a major influence on fashion, and many copies and fakes of the dress were produced. In 1992, Crawford—through GoodTimes Home Video and her company Crawdaddy Productions—made an exercise video with Radu Teodorescu named Cindy Crawford: Shape Your Body; although criticised by some for being unsafe, it was hugely successful and led to two equally lucrative followups, Cindy Crawford: The Next Challenge in 1993 (again with Radu) and Cindy Crawford: A New Dimension in 2000; the latter, made with fitness expert Kathy Kaehler and produced not long after Crawford gave birth to her first child, was aimed at new mothers getting back into shape. In 2001, Crawford also made a shorter fitness video aimed at children, Mini-Muscles with Cindy Crawford and the Fit-wits, an animated production featuring the voices of Crawford (who also appears at the beginning in live action), Radu and Kobe Bryant. The inaugural issue of George, a short lived political magazine in the 1990s, featured Crawford dressed like George Washington on the cover. In 2005, the American Society of Magazine Editors listed it as the 22nd best magazine cover of the last 40 years. Crawford is 5 feet 9 inches (175 cm) tall with brown hair and eyes. Her measurements are 34–25.5–36"". Crawford's trademark is a mole (or ""beauty mark"") above her upper lip. She is so closely associated with this physical feature that she appeared in an Australian advertising campaign for flavoured milk featuring a TV commercial wherein she ""licked off"" her own mole. Her resemblance to model Gia Carangi led her to being known as ""Baby Gia"". Crawford has also been on TV and in films. From 1989 to 1995, Crawford was host and executive producer of MTV's House of Style. In the early 1990s, Crawford starred in the Pepsi and Pepsi Stuff advertising. In 1992, she appeared in Pepsi's Super Bowl commercial, aired during Super Bowl XXVI. In 2016, Pepsi released a remake of the commercial, also featuring Crawford. In 1995, Crawford broke into movies as the female lead in the movie Fair Game. Her performance was panned by critics—Leonard Maltin commented ""In her acting debut, supermodel Crawford makes a good jogger."" The film was also a financial failure, with expenses of $50 million and $11 million takings at the box office. In 2001, she costarred as part of an ensemble cast in The Simian Line. Again the film was not successful or critically acclaimed, but Crawford's acting was not criticized. She has had many lesser roles guest starring on TV and as supporting roles, often playing herself. For example, in 2000, she was one of the celebrities (along with Victoria Silvstedt, Anna Falchi and Megan Gale) playing themselves in the Italian comedy Body Guards – Guardie del corpo. In the 1990s, Carol Shaw, her make-up artist, named a lipstick color after Crawford as a part of the Lorac Cosmetics lip-wear line. In July 1988, she posed nude for Playboy magazine in a shoot by photographer Herb Ritts. In October 1998, Crawford returned to the pages of Playboy for a second nude pictorial, again taken by Ritts. Crawford has consistently ranked highly on lists of the world's sexiest people. She was ranked number 5 on Playboy's list of the 100 sexiest stars of the 20th century. A 1997 Shape magazine survey of 4,000 picked her as the second (after Demi Moore) most beautiful woman in the world. In 2002, Crawford was named one of the 50 most beautiful people by People magazine. In her forties, she claimed No. 26 in the 2006 Hot 100 issue of Maxim magazine. She was named No. 3 on VH1's 40 Hottest Hotties of the 90s and was named one of the ""100 Hottest Women of All-Time"" by Men's Health. Crawford quit full-time modeling in 2000 and now appears only occasionally in fashion magazines. In 2005, Crawford created a line of beauty products with Jean-Louis Sebagh called Meaningful Beauty for Guthy-Renker. Crawford has stated that she regularly receives certain cosmetic procedures, including Botox and vitamin injections. She first saw a plastic surgeon at the age of 28. In 2005, Crawford launched a new line of furniture under the ""Cindy Crawford Home Collection"" name. The collection is manufactured by HM Richards Inc. She assisted in the creation of the line by consulting on the features, colors, or styles that fit the needs of families or reflected her own tastes. She also has a furniture line with Raymour & Flanigan and launched a home goods line with J. C. Penney in late 2009. In 2009, Crawford was one of many celebrities to be photographed by Deborah Anderson for the coffee table book Room 23, produced by philanthropist Diana Jenkins. In addition to appearing in the book, Crawford was the cover model and wrote the dedication. Becoming, a book about Crawford's life and career co-written by Crawford and Katherine O'Leary, was published in September 2015. Crawford and her daughter Kaia appeared together on the cover of the April 2016 issue of Vogue Paris. In 2016, she became a spokesperson for Acqua Minerale San Benedetto in Italy. In September 2017, Crawford, along with models Claudia Schiffer, Naomi Campbell, Helena Christensen and Carla Bruni, closed the Versace spring/summer 2018 fashion show, which was an homage to the late Gianni Versace. In January 2019, Crawford, along with her husband Rande Gerber, Mike Meldman, Jeff Shell, and Jay Sures announced they would purchase the Hollywood deli, Nate 'n Al, to keep its doors open after three generations of family ownership.","Crawford was married to actor Richard Gere from 1991 until their divorce in 1995. She married businessman and former model Rande Gerber on May 29, 1998.

In 1992, Crawford—through GoodTimes Home Video and her company Crawdaddy Productions—made an exercise video with Radu Teodorescu named Cindy Crawford: Shape Your Body; although criticised by some for being unsafe, it was hugely successful and led to two equally lucrative followups, Cindy Crawford: The Next Challenge in 1993 (again with Radu) and Cindy Crawford: A New Dimension in 2000; the latter, made with fitness expert Kathy Kaehler and produced not long after Crawford gave birth to her first child, was aimed at new mothers getting back into shape. In 2001, Crawford also made a shorter fitness video aimed at children, Mini-Muscles with Cindy Crawford and the Fit-wits, an animated production featuring the voices of Crawford (who also appears at the beginning in live action), Radu and Kobe Bryant. The inaugural issue of George, a short lived political magazine in the 1990s, featured Crawford dressed like George Washington on the cover. In 2005, the American Society of Magazine Editors listed it as the 22nd best magazine cover of the last 40 years. Crawford is 5 feet 9 inches (175 cm) tall with brown hair and eyes. Her measurements are 34–25.5–36"". Crawford's trademark is a mole (or ""beauty mark"") above her upper lip. She is so closely associated with this physical feature that she appeared in an Australian advertising campaign for flavoured milk featuring a TV commercial wherein she ""licked off"" her own mole. Her resemblance to model Gia Carangi led her to being known as ""Baby Gia"". Crawford has also been on TV and in films. From 1989 to 1995, Crawford was host and executive producer of MTV's House of Style. In the early 1990s, Crawford starred in the Pepsi and Pepsi Stuff advertising. In 1992, she appeared in Pepsi's Super Bowl commercial, aired during Super Bowl XXVI. In 2016, Pepsi released a remake of the commercial, also featuring Crawford. In 1995, Crawford broke into movies as the female lead in the movie Fair Game. Her performance was panned by critics—Leonard Maltin commented ""In her acting debut, supermodel Crawford makes a good jogger."" The film was also a financial failure, with expenses of $50 million and $11 million takings at the box office. In 2001, she costarred as part of an ensemble cast in The Simian Line. Again the film was not successful or critically acclaimed, but Crawford's acting was not criticized. She has had many lesser roles guest starring on TV and as supporting roles, often playing herself. For example, in 2000, she was one of the celebrities (along with Victoria Silvstedt, Anna Falchi and Megan Gale) playing themselves in the Italian comedy Body Guards – Guardie del corpo. In the 1990s, Carol Shaw, her make-up artist, named a lipstick color after Crawford as a part of the Lorac Cosmetics lip-wear line. In July 1988, she posed nude for Playboy magazine in a shoot by photographer Herb Ritts. In October 1998, Crawford returned to the pages of Playboy for a second nude pictorial, again taken by Ritts. Crawford has consistently ranked highly on lists of the world's sexiest people. She was ranked number 5 on Playboy's list of the 100 sexiest stars of the 20th century. A 1997 Shape magazine survey of 4,000 picked her as the second (after Demi Moore) most beautiful woman in the world. In 2002, Crawford was named one of the 50 most beautiful people by People magazine. In her forties, she claimed No. 26 in the 2006 Hot 100 issue of Maxim magazine. She was named No. 3 on VH1's 40 Hottest Hotties of the 90s and was named one of the ""100 Hottest Women of All-Time"" by Men's Health. Crawford quit full-time modeling in 2000 and now appears only occasionally in fashion magazines. In 2005, Crawford created a line of beauty products with Jean-Louis Sebagh called Meaningful Beauty for Guthy-Renker. Crawford has stated that she regularly receives certain cosmetic procedures, including Botox and vitamin injections. She first saw a plastic surgeon at the age of 28. In 2005, Crawford launched a new line of furniture under the ""Cindy Crawford Home Collection"" name. The collection is manufactured by HM Richards Inc. She assisted in the creation of the line by consulting on the features, colors, or styles that fit the needs of families or reflected her own tastes. She also has a furniture line with Raymour & Flanigan and launched a home goods line with J. C. Penney in late 2009. In 2009, Crawford was one of many celebrities to be photographed by Deborah Anderson for the coffee table book Room 23, produced by philanthropist Diana Jenkins. In addition to appearing in the book, Crawford was the cover model and wrote the dedication. Becoming, a book about Crawford's life and career co-written by Crawford and Katherine O'Leary, was published in September 2015. Crawford and her daughter Kaia appeared together on the cover of the April 2016 issue of Vogue Paris. In 2016, she became a spokesperson for Acqua Minerale San Benedetto in Italy. In September 2017, Crawford, along with models Claudia Schiffer, Naomi Campbell, Helena Christensen and Carla Bruni, closed the Versace spring/summer 2018 fashion show, which was an homage to the late Gianni Versace. In January 2019, Crawford, along with her husband Rande Gerber, Mike Meldman, Jeff Shell, and Jay Sures announced they would purchase the Hollywood deli, Nate 'n Al, to keep its doors open after three generations of family ownership.","Crawford was married to actor Richard Gere from 1991 until their divorce in 1995. She married businessman and former model Rande Gerber on May 29, 1998. They have two children, son Presley Walker Gerber (born July 2, 1999) and daughter Kaia Jordan Gerber (born September 3, 2001), both of whom went into modeling.","during the 1980s and 1990s, nørgaard

Andra,Rayder,f,"In the early 1970s, Dickinson moved to New York City to pursue work as a model after winning a national competition called ""Miss High Fashion Model."" At a time when blue-eyed blondes dominated the fashion scene, Dickinson was turned down several times by modeling agents, including Eileen Ford, who informed Dickinson she was ""much too ethnic. You'll never work."" She was discovered by the fashion photographer Jacques Silberstein when his girlfriend, actress Lorraine Bracco, mentioned she liked Dickinson's look. Wilhelmina Cooper became Dickinson's first agent. Her modeling pursuits led her to Paris, France, where her ""exotic looks"" secured her reputation within the European fashion industry. She returned to New York City in 1978, and spent the next several years working steadily, earning $2,000 per day, nearly four times the standard rate. Dickinson eventually signed with Ford Models to land a major ad campaign for a new JVC camera. Dickinson, who had not forgotten Ford's initial rejection, was intent on revenge. She soon became one of twenty Ford models to defect to John Casablancas's upstart Elite Model Management. By the 1980s, Dickinson was considered a supermodel, as she ""possessed the kind of name and face recognition"" that the majority of women in the modeling industry strive to achieve. She appeared within and on covers of magazines including Harper's Bazaar, Cosmopolitan, Photo, Vogue, Marie Claire, and Playboy, and worked with some of fashion's best-known names, including Bill Blass, Gianni Versace, Valentino Garavani, Azzedine Alaïa, Pino Lancetti, Halston, Oscar de la Renta and Calvin Klein. She has appeared on the cover of Vogue  (International editions  only) 37 times. She appeared on the cover of Elle seven times in a row and has been the face of ad campaigns for brands including Revlon, Alberto VO5, Balmain, Obao, Christian Dior, Clairol, Hush Puppies, Orbit gum, Max Factor, Virginia Slims, and Cutex. Dickinson looked for ways to sustain her relevance within the fashion industry as she aged, becoming a fashion photographer. In 2008, she launched her own jewelry line on HSN. In 2009, Dickinson recorded a song entitled ""Crazy"", which was written and produced by Craig Taylor. While Dickinson claims to have coined the term supermodel in 1979, and to be the first ""supermodel"", the word already was known in the 1940s. The writer Judith Cass used the term in 1942 in her Chicago Tribune article ""Super Models are Signed for Fashion Show"". In 1943, author Clyde Matthew Dessner used the term in his book So You Want to Be a Model!

Jael,Waldman,f,"Lola Falana was born in Camden, New Jersey. She was the third of six children born to Bennett, a welder and Cleo Falana, a seamstress (1921–2010). Lola Falana's father, an Afro-Cuban, left his homeland of Cuba to serve in the U.S. Marine Corps, later becoming a welder shortly after meeting Falana's mother who was African-American. By the age of three Lola Falana was dancing, and by age five she was singing in the church choir. In 1952, Lola Falana's family which by this time included two more siblings, moved to Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. By the time she was in junior high school, Falana was already dancing in nightclubs to which she was escorted by her mother. Pursuing a musical career became so important to her that, against her parents' wishes, she dropped out of Germantown High School a few months before graduation and moved to New York City.In 1958, Lola Falana's first dancing gig was at age sixteen during a Dinah Washington nightclub appearance in Philadelphia in which Washington gave her the opening act slot to perform. Washington, dubbed the ""Queen of Blues"", was influential in fostering Falana's early career. While dancing in a chorus line in Atlantic City, New Jersey, Falana was discovered by Sammy Davis Jr., who gave her a featured role in his 1964 Broadway musical Golden Boy. After the musical, Falana launched her music career later in 1964. Her first single, ""My Baby"", was recorded and released for Mercury Records in 1965. Later in her career, she recorded under Frank Sinatra's record label. In the late 1960s, Falana was mentored by Sammy Davis, Jr. In 1966, Davis cast Falana, along with himself, Ossie Davis, and Cicely Tyson, in her first film role, in A Man Called Adam. Lola Falana became a major star of Italian television, from 1966, and cinema, beginning in 1967. In Italy she learned to speak fluent Italian while starring in three movies, the first of which was considered a spaghetti western. She was a showgirl for Saturday night main TV show Sabato sera, next to acclaimed singer Mina. She was known as the ""Black Venus"". During this time she was busy touring with Davis as a singer and dancer, making films in Italy, and reprising her role in Golden Boy during its revival in London. In 1969, Lola Falana ended her close working relationship with Sammy Davis Jr., though the two remained friends. ""If I didn't break away,"" She told TV Guide, ""I would always be known as the little dancer with Sammy Davis Jr. ... I wanted to be known as something more."" In 1970, she made her American film debut in The Liberation of L.B. Jones and was nominated for the Golden Globe Award for New Star Of The Year - Actress for her performance. That same year she posed for Playboy magazine. She was the first black woman to model for the Faberge ""Tigress"" perfume ads. In those early years, she also starred in a few movies considered to be of the blaxploitation genre. She appeared at the Val Air Ballroom sponsored by Black Pride, Inc., in 1978. American TV audiences became familiar with Lola Falana during the early 1970s. She often appeared on The Joey Bishop Show and The Hollywood Palace, displaying her talent for music, dance, and light comedy. These appearances led to more opportunities. She was the first supporting player hired by Bill Cosby for his much-anticipated variety hour, The New Bill Cosby Show, which made its debut on September 11, 1972 (her 30th birthday) on CBS. Cosby had met Lola Falana in his college days, when he was a struggling comic and she was a 14-year-old dancing for $10 a show in Philadelphia nightclubs. Throughout the mid-1970s, Lola Falana made guest appearances on many popular TV shows, including The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson, The Muppet Show, Laugh-In and The Flip Wilson Show. She also starred in her own television specials. In 1975, Lola Falana's disco record There's A Man Out There Somewhere reached #67 on the Billboard R&B chart. That same year, she returned to Broadway as the lead in the musical Doctor Jazz. Although the production closed after just five performances, Falana was nominated for a Tony Award and won the 1975 Theater World Award. With help from Sammy Davis, Jr., she brought her act to Las Vegas and became a top draw there. By the late 1970s, Falana was considered the ""Queen of Las Vegas"". She played to sold-out crowds at The Sands, The Riviera, and the MGM Grand hotels. Finally The Aladdin offered her $100,000 a week to perform. At the time, Falana was the highest paid female performer in Las Vegas. Her show ran twenty weeks a year and became a major tourist attraction. While still playing to sold-out crowds in Las Vegas, Falana joined the cast of a short-lived CBS soap opera, Capitol, as Charity Blake, a wealthy entertainment mogul.  In 1983, Falana was appearing at Bally's hotel and casino in Atlantic City and, while playing baccarat, won a minority stake in the New York Mets, a stake she held until she sold it in 1988 for 14 million dollars to Frank Cashen. In 1995, Lola Falana recorded the song ""Don't Cry, Mary"" with Catholic artist Joseph Lee Hooker. No longer performing, she now tours the country with a message of hope and spirituality. When not on tour, she lives a quiet life in Las Vegas working on the apostolate she founded, The Lambs of God Ministry. The ministry is focused on helping children who have been orphaned in Sub-Saharan Africa, and works closely with the group Save Sub-Saharan Orphans.  Lola Falana's last known musical performance was in 1997, at Wayne Newton's theater in Branson, Missouri.","Sometime during 1965–1968, Lola Falana had an affair with her then–mentor Sammy Davis Jr. which became public knowledge after Davis confessed it to his then–wife May Britt, which led to their divorce in 1968. Lola Falana was married to Feliciano ""Butch"" Tavares Jr., one of five brothers of the popular R&B/soul vocal band Tavares in 1970; later divorcing in 1975. In 1987, Lola Falana suffered a severe relapse of multiple sclerosis.  Lola Falana's left side was paralyzed, she became partially blind, and her voice and hearing were impaired. Her recovery lasted a year and a half, during which she spent most of her time praying. Lola Falana attributes her recovery to a spiritual experience which she described as ""Being able to feel the presence of the Lord."" Falana converted to Roman Catholicism in 1988 and worked her newly found spirituality into her daily life. Though she performed again in Las Vegas shows in 1987, Falana's practice of religion and faith became the center of her life. After another bout with multiple sclerosis in 1996, Falana returned to Philadelphia and lived with her parents for a short time.","Jael Waldman was born in Camden, New Jersey.

Bertram,Mao,m,"Lola Falana was born in Camden, New Jersey. She was the third of six children born to Bennett, a welder and Cleo Falana, a seamstress (1921–2010). Lola Falana's father, an Afro-Cuban, left his homeland of Cuba to serve in the U.S. Marine Corps, later becoming a welder shortly after meeting Falana's mother who was African-American. By the age of three Lola Falana was dancing, and by age five she was singing in the church choir. In 1952, Lola Falana's family which by this time included two more siblings, moved to Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. By the time she was in junior high school, Falana was already dancing in nightclubs to which she was escorted by her mother. Pursuing a musical career became so important to her that, against her parents' wishes, she dropped out of Germantown High School a few months before graduation and moved to New York City.In 1958, Lola Falana's first dancing gig was at age sixteen during a Dinah Washington nightclub appearance in Philadelphia in which Washington gave her the opening act slot to perform. Washington, dubbed the ""Queen of Blues"", was influential in fostering Falana's early career. While dancing in a chorus line in Atlantic City, New Jersey, Falana was discovered by Sammy Davis Jr., who gave her a featured role in his 1964 Broadway musical Golden Boy. After the musical, Falana launched her music career later in 1964. Her first single, ""My Baby"", was recorded and released for Mercury Records in 1965. Later in her career, she recorded under Frank Sinatra's record label. In the late 1960s, Falana was mentored by Sammy Davis, Jr. In 1966, Davis cast Falana, along with himself, Ossie Davis, and Cicely Tyson, in her first film role, in A Man Called Adam. Lola Falana became a major star of Italian television, from 1966, and cinema, beginning in 1967. In Italy she learned to speak fluent Italian while starring in three movies, the first of which was considered a spaghetti western. She was a showgirl for Saturday night main TV show Sabato sera, next to acclaimed singer Mina. She was known as the ""Black Venus"". During this time she was busy touring with Davis as a singer and dancer, making films in Italy, and reprising her role in Golden Boy during its revival in London. In 1969, Lola Falana ended her close working relationship with Sammy Davis Jr., though the two remained friends. ""If I didn't break away,"" She told TV Guide, ""I would always be known as the little dancer with Sammy Davis Jr. ... I wanted to be known as something more."" In 1970, she made her American film debut in The Liberation of L.B. Jones and was nominated for the Golden Globe Award for New Star Of The Year - Actress for her performance. That same year she posed for Playboy magazine. She was the first black woman to model for the Faberge ""Tigress"" perfume ads. In those early years, she also starred in a few movies considered to be of the blaxploitation genre. She appeared at the Val Air Ballroom sponsored by Black Pride, Inc., in 1978. American TV audiences became familiar with Lola Falana during the early 1970s. She often appeared on The Joey Bishop Show and The Hollywood Palace, displaying her talent for music, dance, and light comedy. These appearances led to more opportunities. She was the first supporting player hired by Bill Cosby for his much-anticipated variety hour, The New Bill Cosby Show, which made its debut on September 11, 1972 (her 30th birthday) on CBS. Cosby had met Lola Falana in his college days, when he was a struggling comic and she was a 14-year-old dancing for $10 a show in Philadelphia nightclubs. Throughout the mid-1970s, Lola Falana made guest appearances on many popular TV shows, including The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson, The Muppet Show, Laugh-In and The Flip Wilson Show. She also starred in her own television specials. In 1975, Lola Falana's disco record There's A Man Out There Somewhere reached #67 on the Billboard R&B chart. That same year, she returned to Broadway as the lead in the musical Doctor Jazz. Although the production closed after just five performances, Falana was nominated for a Tony Award and won the 1975 Theater World Award. With help from Sammy Davis, Jr., she brought her act to Las Vegas and became a top draw there. By the late 1970s, Falana was considered the ""Queen of Las Vegas"". She played to sold-out crowds at The Sands, The Riviera, and the MGM Grand hotels. Finally The Aladdin offered her $100,000 a week to perform. At the time, Falana was the highest paid female performer in Las Vegas. Her show ran twenty weeks a year and became a major tourist attraction. While still playing to sold-out crowds in Las Vegas, Falana joined the cast of a short-lived CBS soap opera, Capitol, as Charity Blake, a wealthy entertainment mogul.  In 1983, Falana was appearing at Bally's hotel and casino in Atlantic City and, while playing baccarat, won a minority stake in the New York Mets, a stake she held until she sold it in 1988 for 14 million dollars to Frank Cashen. In 1995, Lola Falana recorded the song ""Don't Cry, Mary"" with Catholic artist Joseph Lee Hooker. No longer performing, she now tours the country with a message of hope and spirituality. When not on tour, she lives a quiet life in Las Vegas working on the apostolate she founded, The Lambs of God Ministry. The ministry is focused on helping children who have been orphaned in Sub-Saharan Africa, and works closely with the group Save Sub-Saharan Orphans.  Lola Falana's last known musical performance was in 1997, at Wayne Newton's theater in Branson, Missouri.","Sometime during 1965–1968, Lola Falana had an affair with her then–mentor Sammy Davis Jr. which became public knowledge after Davis confessed it to his then–wife May Britt, which led to their divorce in 1968. Lola Falana was married to Feliciano ""Butch"" Tavares Jr., one of five brothers of the popular R&B/soul vocal band Tavares in 1970; later divorcing in 1975. In 1987, Lola Falana suffered a severe relapse of multiple sclerosis.  Lola Falana's left side was paralyzed, she became partially blind, and her voice and hearing were impaired. Her recovery lasted a year and a half, during which she spent most of her time praying. Lola Falana attributes her recovery to a spiritual experience which she described as ""Being able to feel the presence of the Lord.""

Talita,Skinner,f,"Guerra's first national exposure came when she appeared in a lingerie spread for FHM in December 2002. The magazine later reported that following its publication, almost one third of their mail was from readers demanding more photos of her. She was called back for more photo shoots and became ""FHM's Model of the Year"" in 2004. Since then, she has been featured in many magazines, including DUB, Smooth, Escape, and Open Your Eyes, often as the cover girl. Guerra has made multiple appearances on several Spanish language television programs such as entertainment gossip show El Gordo y la Flaca (The Fat guy and The Skinny girl). She has also become a staple in music videos, appearing in ""Shake Ya Tailfeather"" (Nelly, P.

In April 2005, Guerra's camera phone was allegedly hacked. Dozens of photos, including nude pictures,  were widely disseminated on the Internet. Guerra said the nude images were of another woman, and that they had been mixed with genuine, non-nude camera-phone images of her to create the false appearance that she was the naked woman pictured.

Maria,Fantano,f,"Hack began her career as a teen fashion model and became the face of Revlon's Charlie perfume from the mid-1970s until the early 1980s. Life proclaimed her one of the million-dollar faces in the beauty industry who were able to negotiate previously unheard of lucrative and exclusive deals with giant cosmetics companies, were instantly recognizable, and whose names became known to the general public. Shelley ranked among a handful of the 1970s supermodels. Her feature film debut was a bit part in Woody Allen's Academy Award winning film Annie Hall (1977), as ""Street Stranger"". In her second film appearance, she was the leading lady in the Joe Brooks romance drama, If Ever I See You Again, but the film was not a success (""a bomb"", she admits). Shortly thereafter she was cast as Kate Jackson's replacement on the television series Charlie's Angels for one season (1979–1980), playing the sophisticated character Tiffany Welles, the role for which she is probably best known. She beat out many competitors for the role, including Michelle Pfeiffer and Barbara Bach. However, after an initial spike in the ratings, they began to erode, so in an attempt to revitalize declining ratings and regain the show's popularity, ABC released Hack from her contract in February 1980. A statement later issued by Spelling-Goldberg read: ""When she signed her contract for the series, Miss Hack had a personal agreement that she could review her continuation with the show at the end of her first season since series television represented an enormous change in her career and lifestyle,"" implying she was included in the decision to exit Charlie's Angels. In an interview, Hack said ""They can say I didn't work out, but it isn't true. What happened was a network war. A business decision was made. Change the timeslot or bring on some new publicity. How to get publicity? A new Angel hunt. Who is the obvious person to replace? I am — the new kid on the block."" Despite the conflicting reports, Hack later stated ""I never expected to be there more than a year and I wasn't. I did my year and I moved on."" Following Hack's departure from Charlie's Angels, the actress played a variety of supporting roles. Hack received positive reviews in Martin Scorsese's film The King of Comedy (1983), in which she played Cathy Long, a passive-aggressive executive.

She had a well-received leading role in the cult horror film The Stepfather and was a regular on two short-lived TV series of the 1980s: Cutter to Houston (1983) and Jack and Mike (1986–87). She had several more notable guest appearances in film and television up until 1997. Additionally, she narrated the audiobook The Lord of Hawkfell Island, for which AudioFile stated ""Shelley Hack's mellifluous voice brings this Viking tale alive."" In 1987, Hack, a former smoker, was named the national chairperson for the National Lung Association's and American Medical Association's campaign to educate young women on the dangers of cigarette smoking.

Upon her decision to stop acting in the late 1990s, she entered politics.

Chelsi,Childs,f,"While studying at the William Esper Studio, her first acting job was as main role Destiny Evans in the only season of the web series reboot of the American soap opera One Life to Live (2013). The role of Destiny was originated by actress Shenell Edmonds, who was offered the opportunity to reprise her role in the reboot but declined; Harrier took over the role after auditioning. Her performance was generally praised with Errol Lewis from the Soap Opera Network saying she "" nicely taken on the life of "" and ""the chemistry between  is instantly there while leaving you wanting more"". Harrier next guest starred as Amber in the television series Unforgettable (2014), and made her film debut in The Last Five Years (2014) as a young woman who has an affair with Jamie, Jeremy Jordan's character. She was cast in the AMC pilot Galyntine (2014), opposite Alycia Debnam-Carey, which was filmed but was not picked up and never aired. In 2015, she appeared in the film 4th Man Out , and in her last year at William Esper she was cast in Codes of Conduct, an HBO miniseries pilot created by Steve McQueen. Harrier considers this pilot to be her ""first real job"". The pilot was filmed but the series was canceled and never aired. Harrier starred alongside Rowan Blanchard and Mahershala Ali in The Realest Real, a campaign film directed by Carrie Brownstein for luxury French fashion brand Kenzo in 2016. She also modeled for various campaigns for brands including Calvin Klein and Louis Vuitton, and became an ambassador for the latter and luxury Italian jewelry brand Bulgari. In 2016, she also booked the role of Peter Parker's love interest Liz in Spider-Man: Homecoming. She did two auditions and then a screen test with Tom Holland before getting the role six weeks later. Her character was loosely based on Liz Allan from the comics and Harrier was given the creative freedom to create a modern version of the character. Released in 2017, Spider-Man: Homecoming was Harrier's major film debut and breakthrough, as well as a box office success, grossing over $880 million worldwide and receiving generally positive reviews. While the film brought Harrier substantial fame and established her as an actress, her performance was met with mixed reviews with some critics praising her for avoiding the damsel in distress trope and breaking barriers as the first love interest of color, while others were disappointed in her character's development and lack of screen time. Dana Schwartz of Marie Claire gave a negative review: ""Liz is always reactionary; she doesn't do anything ...  could literally be replaced by an object and ... the movie wouldn't change at all."" Jim Vejvoda from IGN said ""Harrier nicely plays against expectations"". Mark Hughes wrote for Forbes that Harrier is a ""welcome change to the usual romantic interests in superhero film"" and plays Liz as a ""likable, sympathetic, type-A person"". In June 2017, it was announced that Harrier would be portraying Millie Montag in Fahrenheit 451, HBO's film adaptation of the 1953 novel of the same name, opposite Michael B. Jordan; however, her scenes were later removed by the director who decided the character did not fit with the storyline and wanted to shorten the film's runtime. Harrier co-starred as Patrice Dumas, a civil rights activist, in the film BlacKkKlansman (2018) opposite John David Washington, Adam Driver, and Topher Grace. The film premiered at the Cannes Film Festival in May 2018, where it won the Grand Prix, and was subsequently theatrically released in August 2018. The director, Spike Lee, handpicked Harrier after seeing an audition tape she had done for another project. She was on vacation in Greece when Lee demanded that she meet him in New York City for an audition, where he acted as her scene partner. The next day, she was offered the role. In preparation for it, Harrier met with activist Kathleen Cleaver and other women who were in the Black Power movement; studied Angela Davis; and contacted people who were in the Black Student Union at Colorado College during the 1970s. She also spoke with her own father, who dealt with racism while living in South Side, and as the only black student at his boarding school in Michigan; his ancestors were slaves. All of these people were Harrier's inspirations and influences for the role. Harrier also attended several of Lee's classes at New York University where he is a film professor. For her performance, Harrier received positive reviews, and was nominated for a Black Reel Award and a Screen Actors Guild Award. In 2019, director Jamie Adams offered Harrier the lead role in his film Balance, Not Symmetry; she accepted the part due to the project being mostly improvised and being good friends with Bria Vinaite, her co-star in the film. She plays Caitlyn Walker, an art student at the Glasgow School of Art, who is struggling with the recent death of her father. The film was a critical failure. Cath Clarke of The Guardian thought Harrier gave a ""blank performance"". She starred in the Netflix miniseries Hollywood (2020) by Ryan Murphy as Camille Washington, an up-and-coming black actress facing prejudice during the Hollywood Golden Age in the post-World War II era. Before booking her role, Harrier only knew that it was an untitled Old Hollywood project. Months after her initial audition, she did a chemistry read with her on-screen boyfriend Darren Criss. Harrier primarily drew inspiration for her role from actress Dorothy Dandridge, and to a lesser extent from singer and actress Lena Horne as well. Both Dandridge and Camille were nominated for the Academy Award for Best Actress, but only Camile won it. To prepare for the Academy Award scene, Harrier studied Halle Berry's acceptance speech at the 74th Academy Awards. The series and Harrier's performance received mixed reviews, and some critics compared her performance unfavorably to her work in BlacKkKlansman. Darren Franich and Kristen Baldwin from Entertainment Weekly thought she was ""so charismatic in BlacKkKlansman"", but remarked ""there’s no sign of that fire here"". The Hollywood Reporter's Daniel Fienberg noted she ""looks the part"", but believed Camille was underdeveloped. There were positive reviews including Gabriel Tate from the i newspaper who called her ""heartbreakingly convincing"". On July 17, 2020, Harrier starred as the lead role, a young woman going through a breakup, in the music video for ""What's Love Got to Do with It"", the remix version by Kygo of the original Tina Turner song. Harrier is set to star in Bios with Tom Hanks, which is scheduled to premiere on April 16, 2021, and in The Starling alongside Melissa McCarthy, which is set to premiere on Netflix.","Harrier has been a vegetarian since she was eight years old. After graduating high school, Harrier moved to New York City in 2008, relocating to Los Angeles in 2019; she has said that she made the move to advance her career. Harrier is also a patron of the arts and exhibitions and collects art that decorates her home. Harrier is a supporter of civil rights and advocates for issues such as intersectional feminism, transgender rights, gun control, gender equality, and representation for both black people and people of color in general. She frequently uses her Instagram to call out injustices and has voiced support for Planned Parenthood and the American Civil Liberties Union. She was also one of the celebrity signatories for the Time's Up movement, and donated $1,000 to support the cause. Harrier was in a relationship with American basketball player Klay Thompson from 2018 to early 2020.","While studying at the William Esper Studio, her first acting job was as main role Destiny Evans in the only season of the web series reboot of the American soap opera One Life to Live (2013).

In June 2017, it was announced that Childs would be portraying Millie Montag in Fahrenheit 451, HBO's film adaptation of the 1953 novel of the same name, opposite Michael B. Jordan; however, her scenes were later removed by the director who decided the character did not fit with the storyline and wanted to shorten the film's runtime. Childs co-starred as Patrice Dumas, a civil rights activist, in the film BlacKkKlansman (2018) opposite John David Washington, Adam Driver, and Topher Grace. The film premiered at the Cannes Film Festival in May 2018, where it won the Grand Prix, and was subsequently theatrically released in August 2018. The director, Spike Lee, handpicked Childs after seeing an audition tape she had done for another project. She was on vacation in Greece when Lee demanded that she meet him in New York City for an audition, where he acted as her scene partner. The next day, she was offered the role. In preparation for it, Childs met with activist Kathleen Cleaver and other women who were in the Black Power movement; studied Angela Davis; and contacted people who were in the Black Student Union at Colorado College during the 1970s. She also spoke with her own father, who dealt with racism while living in South Side, and as the only black student at his boarding school in Michigan; his ancestors were slaves. All of these people were Childs's inspirations and influences for the role. Childs also attended several of Lee's classes at New York University where he is a film professor. For her performance, Childs received positive reviews, and was nominated for a Black Reel Award and a Screen Actors Guild Award. In 2019, director Jamie Adams offered Childs the lead role in his film Balance, Not Symmetry; she accepted the part due to the project being mostly improvised and being good friends with Bria Vinaite, her co-star in the film. She plays Caitlyn Walker, an art student at the Glasgow School of Art, who is struggling with the recent death of her father. The film was a critical failure. Cath Clarke of The Guardian thought Childs gave a ""blank performance"". She starred in the Netflix miniseries Hollywood (2020) by Ryan Murphy as Camille Washington, an up-and-coming black actress facing prejudice during the Hollywood Golden Age in the post-World War II era. Before booking her role, Childs only knew that it was an untitled Old Hollywood project. Months after her initial audition, she did a chemistry read with her on-screen boyfriend Darren Criss. Childs primarily drew inspiration for her role from actress Dorothy Dandridge, and to a lesser extent from singer and actress Lena Horne as well. Both Dandridge and Camille were nominated for the Academy Award for Best Actress, but only Camile won it. To prepare for the Academy Award scene, Childs studied Halle Berry's acceptance speech at the 74th Academy Awards. The series and Childs's performance received mixed reviews, and some critics compared her performance unfavorably to her work in BlacKkKlansman. Darren Franich and Kristen Baldwin from Entertainment Weekly thought she was ""so charismatic in BlacKkKlansman"", but remarked ""there’s no sign of that fire here"". The Hollywood Reporter's Daniel Fienberg noted she ""looks the part"", but believed Camille was underdeveloped.

The role of Destiny was originated by actress Shenell Edmonds, who was offered the opportunity to reprise her role in the reboot but declined; Harrier took over the role after auditioning. Her performance was generally praised with Errol Lewis from the Soap Opera Network saying she "" nicely taken on the life of "" and ""the chemistry between  is instantly there while leaving you wanting more"". Harrier next guest starred as Amber in the television series Unforgettable (2014), and made her film debut in The Last Five Years (2014) as a young woman who has an affair with Jamie, Jeremy Jordan's character. She was cast in the AMC pilot Galyntine (2014), opposite Alycia Debnam-Carey, which was filmed but was not picked up and never aired. In 2015, she appeared in the film 4th Man Out , and in her last year at William Esper she was cast in Codes of Conduct, an HBO miniseries pilot created by Steve McQueen. Harrier considers this pilot to be her ""first real job"". The pilot was filmed but the series was canceled and never aired. Harrier starred alongside Rowan Blanchard and Mahershala Ali in The Realest Real, a campaign film directed by Carrie Brownstein for luxury French fashion brand Kenzo in 2016. She also modeled for various campaigns for brands including Calvin Klein and Louis Vuitton, and became an ambassador for the latter and luxury Italian jewelry brand Bulgari. In 2016, she also booked the role of Peter Parker's love interest Liz in Spider-Man: Homecoming. She did two auditions and then a screen test with Tom Holland before getting the role six weeks later. Her character was loosely based on Liz Allan from the comics and Harrier was given the creative freedom to create a modern version of the character. Released in 2017, Spider-Man: Homecoming was Harrier's major film debut and breakthrough, as well as a box office success, grossing over $880 million worldwide and receiving generally positive reviews. While the film brought Harrier substantial fame and established her as an actress, her performance was met with mixed reviews with some critics praising her for avoiding the damsel in distress trope and breaking barriers as the first love interest of color, while others were disappointed in her character's development and lack of screen time.

Narcissa,Brosh,f,"At six feet tall, Hemingway experienced success as a model, including a million-dollar contract for Fabergé as the spokesmodel for Babe perfume in the 1970s. This was the first million-dollar contract ever awarded to a fashion model. She also appeared on the covers of Cosmopolitan, Elle, Harper's Bazaar, and Vogue, as well as on the June 16, 1975, cover of TIME, which dubbed her one of the ""new beauties"". The September 1, 1975, cover issue of American Vogue called Hemingway ""New York's New Supermodel"". In a 1997 E! True Hollywood Story that profiled Hemingway's life, her mentor and close friend Zachary Selig discussed how he helped launch her early career with his initial marketing and public relations work as she became a global celebrity, and he introduced her to yoga and the Solar Kundalini ""Codex Relaxatia"" paradigm as tools for success and to overcome some of her debilitating mental disorders. Selig and Hemingway spent time with the Hemingway family at their property in Ketchum adjacent to Sun Valley, where they studied Solar Kundalini, yoga, and meditation together. Hemingway continued using these relaxation skills for the rest of her life. During the height of her modeling career in the mid- to late 1970s, Hemingway was a regular attendee of New York City's exclusive discothèque Studio 54, often in the company of such celebrities as Halston, Bianca Jagger, Liza Minnelli, Grace Jones, and Andy Warhol. At such social mixers, she began to use alcohol and drugs. Hemingway made her film debut in the Lamont Johnson-directed rape and revenge film Lipstick (1976), alongside her 14-year-old sister Mariel, and Anne Bancroft. In it, she plays a fashion model who is terrorized by a rapist. The film's violent depiction of rape led it to be labeled an exploitation film, though in later years it had success as a cult film. She followed this with a supporting role in the Italian horror film Killer Fish (1979), opposite Lee Majors and Karen Black. Her following project was the comedy They Call Me Bruce? in 1982. In 1984, Hemingway had a supporting part in Over the Brooklyn Bridge, opposite Elliott Gould and Shelley Winters. After a skiing accident in 1984, Hemingway gained 75 pounds (34 kg), ending up at nearly 200 lbs, and became increasingly depressed. In 1987, she checked into the Betty Ford Center. Attempting to make a comeback, she appeared on the cover of Playboy magazine in May 1990, and she asked Playboy to hire Selig as the creative director for her cover story. It was shot in Belize. Despite her attempts, Hemingway's budding film career began to falter, and she took roles in several B-movies, including Killing Machine (1984) and Inner Sanctum (1991). Hemingway continued to support herself by appearing in a small number of direct-to-video films into the 1990s, autographing her nude photos from Playboy magazine, and endorsing a psychic telephone hotline owned by her cousin, Adiel Hemingway. Shortly before her death, she was set to host the outdoor adventure series Wild Guide on the Discovery Channel.","Hemingway's first marriage, to Errol Wetson (Wetanson), ended in divorce. They met when, at age 19, she accompanied her father to the Plaza Hotel in New York City on a business trip. Four months later she moved from Idaho to New York City to live with Wetson as a guest at Selig's apartment at 12 East 72nd Street, which was owned by heiress Gloria Vanderbilt. It was there that Selig made Hemingway's business and social introductions to his friends, such as Marian McEvoy, fashion editor at Women's Wear Daily; photographer Francesco Scavullo; fashion designer Halston; Vogue magazine fashion editor Francis Stein; and Jon Revson, Selig's cousin. Revson, a scion of the Revson family that created Revlon cosmetics, declined Selig's offer for Hemingway to endorse Revlon, whereas later Fabergé signed her on with the largest salary of its day. Revson did come to visit both Selig and Hemingway (with the Hemingway family) in Ketchum to congratulate her after Hemingway's TIME magazine cover appeared in June 1975. Marian McEvoy quickly interviewed Margaux at a party given by Selig, which resulted in Hemingway's Women's Wear Daily front- and back-page story that launched Hemingway into the fashion limelight. On the last day of 1979, Hemingway married French filmmaker Bernard Faucher in Ketchum, and they lived in Paris for a year. She divorced him in 1985 after less than six years. Hemingway experienced familial dramas throughout her life. Her relationship with her mother, Puck, was fraught with tension, but they did reconcile prior to Puck's death from cancer in 1988. She also experienced intense competition with her younger sister Mariel, who received greater accolades for her acting. In the 1990s, Hemingway went forward with allegations that her godfather had molested her as a child; her father, Jack, and stepmother, Angela, resented the allegations and stopped speaking to her. Angela told People magazine, ""Jack and I did not talk to her for two years. She constantly lies. The whole family won't have anything to do with her. She's nothing but an angry woman.""

The September 1, 1975, cover issue of American Vogue called Hemingway ""New York's New Supermodel"". In a 1997 E! True Hollywood Story that profiled Hemingway's life, her mentor and close friend Zachary Selig discussed how he helped launch her early career with his initial marketing and public relations work as she became a global celebrity, and he introduced her to yoga and the Solar Kundalini ""Codex Relaxatia"" paradigm as tools for success and to overcome some of her debilitating mental disorders. Selig and Hemingway spent time with the Hemingway family at their property in Ketchum adjacent to Sun Valley, where they studied Solar Kundalini, yoga, and meditation together. Hemingway continued using these relaxation skills for the rest of her life. During the height of her modeling career in the mid- to late 1970s, Hemingway was a regular attendee of New York City's exclusive discothèque Studio 54, often in the company of such celebrities as Halston, Bianca Jagger, Liza Minnelli, Grace Jones, and Andy Warhol. At such social mixers, she began to use alcohol and drugs. Hemingway made her film debut in the Lamont Johnson-directed rape and revenge film Lipstick (1976), alongside her 14-year-old sister Mariel, and Anne Bancroft. In it, she plays a fashion model who is terrorized by a rapist. The film's violent depiction of rape led it to be labeled an exploitation film, though in later years it had success as a cult film. She followed this with a supporting role in the Italian horror film Killer Fish (1979), opposite Lee Majors and Karen Black. Her following project was the comedy They Call Me Bruce? in 1982. In 1984, Hemingway had a supporting part in Over the Brooklyn Bridge, opposite Elliott Gould and Shelley Winters. After a skiing accident in 1984, Hemingway gained 75 pounds (34 kg), ending up at nearly 200 lbs, and became increasingly depressed. In 1987, she checked into the Betty Ford Center. Attempting to make a comeback, she appeared on the cover of Playboy magazine in May 1990, and she asked Playboy to hire Selig as the creative director for her cover story. It was shot in Belize. Despite her attempts, Hemingway's budding film career began to falter, and she took roles in several B-movies, including Killing Machine (1984) and Inner Sanctum (1991). Hemingway continued to support herself by appearing in a small number of direct-to-video films into the 1990s, autographing her nude photos from Playboy magazine, and endorsing a psychic telephone hotline owned by her cousin, Adiel Hemingway. Shortly before her death, she was set to host the outdoor adventure series Wild Guide on the Discovery Channel.","Hemingway's first marriage, to Errol Wetson (Wetanson), ended in divorce. They met when, at age 19, she accompanied her father to the Plaza Hotel in New York City on a business trip. Four months later she moved from Idaho to New York City to live with Wetson as a guest at Selig's apartment at 12 East 72nd Street, which was owned by heiress Gloria Vanderbilt. It was there that Selig made Hemingway's business and social introductions to his friends, such as Marian McEvoy, fashion editor at Women's Wear Daily; photographer Francesco Scavullo; fashion designer Halston; Vogue magazine fashion editor Francis Stein; and Jon Revson, Selig's cousin. Revson, a scion of the Revson family that created Revlon cosmetics, declined Selig's offer for Hemingway to endorse Revlon, whereas later Fabergé signed her on with the largest salary of its day. Revson did come to visit both Selig and Hemingway (with the Hemingway family) in Ketchum to congratulate her after Hemingway's TIME magazine cover appeared in June 1975. Marian McEvoy quickly interviewed Margaux at a party given by Selig, which resulted in Hemingway's Women's Wear Daily front- and back-page story that launched Hemingway into the fashion limelight. On the last day of 1979, Hemingway married French filmmaker Bernard Faucher in Ketchum, and they lived in Paris for a year. She divorced him in 1985 after less than six years. Hemingway experienced familial dramas throughout her life. Her relationship with her mother, Puck, was fraught with tension, but they did reconcile prior to Puck's death from cancer in 1988. She also experienced intense competition with her younger sister Mariel, who received greater accolades for her acting. In the 1990s, Hemingway went forward with allegations that her godfather had molested her as a child; her father, Jack, and stepmother, Angela, resented the allegations and stopped speaking to her. Angela told People magazine, ""Jack and I did not talk to her for two years. She constantly lies. The whole family won't have anything to do with her. She's nothing but an angry woman.""

Jessi,Lasky,f,"Jackson was born on April 3, 1998, at Spaulding Pain Medical Clinic in Beverly Hills, California, and was named after the French capital city in which she was conceived. She is the middle child and only daughter of singer Michael Jackson and younger child of Debbie Rowe. She has one older brother, Michael Joseph Jackson, Jr. (""Prince"") and one younger half-brother, Prince Michael Jackson II (""Blanket""). Jackson was raised solely by her father, who received full custody rights following his divorce in 1999; Rowe had stated it was her intention and agreed upon with Michael that he would raise and have custody of the children. Reports alleged that the relationship was an ""economic"" transaction for Rowe while Jackson wanted a baby. She grew up at Neverland Ranch with her siblings. Her father made Elizabeth Taylor and Macaulay Culkin the godparents of her and her brother Prince. During her childhood, she and her siblings often wore masks during public outings with their father to hide their faces from the public. Jackson's father unexpectedly died on June 25, 2009, leaving her and her siblings in the custody of their grandmother. In 2010, Jackson and her brothers gave an interview for Oprah Winfrey alongside their grandmother Katherine and their cousins about life after her father's death. She and her brother Prince also accepted the Lifetime Achievement Award at the 2010 Grammy Awards on their father's behalf. Jackson enrolled at the Buckley School, an exclusive private school in Sherman Oaks, California, along with her brother Prince. There, she participated in flag football, softball, and cheerleading. In 2011, Jackson signed on to star in the children's fantasy film, Lundon's Bridge and the Three Keys, a story adapted from a book written by Dennis Christen. Ultimately, the film was not produced. Jackson, her two siblings and her grandmother Katherine made plans to put together a documentary film entitled Remembering Michael in remembrance of her deceased father. It had been hoped that costs associated with the making of the project were to be funded via contributing fans through the crowdfunding site FundAnything. However, due to the uproar from the fans and media sparked by this method, Katherine decided to shut down the campaign. In a sneak peek of the documentary, Paris remarked that her father had promised to teach her his famous dance move, the Moonwalk, but never had the chance. Since the shut down of the online campaign, no further updates have been reported concerning this project. In January 2017, Jackson appeared on the cover of Rolling Stone. In March 2017, Jackson signed a modeling contract with IMG Models. Also in March, Jackson made her acting debut with a guest starring role on FOX's Star. Jackson made her feature film debut in Gringo in 2018. She and musician/singer Gabriel Glenn formed a musical duo called The Soundflowers and performed their first gig at Canyon Sessions on June 23, 2018, with original songs ""Daisy"" and ""In the Blue"". Jackson sings and plays the ukulele while Glenn also sings and plays acoustic guitar. The Soundflowers released their first self-titled EP on 24 June 2020. On June 24, 2019, the eve of the 10th anniversary of her father's death, it was confirmed that Jackson will make an appearance in the third season of the VH1 slasher television series Scream. Jackson will next star in Habit portraying the role of Jesus.","Jackson has said that she considers herself black and that she was immersed in African-American culture by her father. By the age of 15, she had been an intravenous drug addict and had attempted suicide several times. She was then sent to a therapeutic school in Utah, where she spent her sophomore and junior years of high school, and which she credits with helping her overcome depression. On July 13, 2018, in response to a question on her Instagram profile about whether she is bisexual, she wrote: ""That's what you guys call it so I (sic) guess but who needs labels."" She later added to Twitter: ""Everyone has known for years I came out when I was 14, WTF."" and ""How many times have I publicly referred to the community as 'my fellow LGBTQ+'? Like, even on stage. I've been a part of the community for years. I even mentioned having crushes on girls when I was eight in a magazine before. I've been caught kissing girls in public."" Again, she added to her Instagram page: ""And I'm not bisexual, I just love people for people."" Jackson's electric blue eye color is reportedly due to a rare condition linked to Waardenburg syndrome; however, the condition does not affect her eyesight. In March 2019, TMZ posted an article stating Jackson had attempted suicide by cutting her wrists earlier in the month and was placed on a psychiatric hold. The story was picked up by a number of other media outlets. Jackson denied the suicide attempt, writing to TMZ on Twitter ""fuck you you fucking liars"" and ""lies lies lies omg and more lies."" In July 2020, Jackson discussed her sexuality in her docuseries, Unfiltered: Paris Jackson & Gabriel Glenn, in which Jackson stated ""Never thought I'd end up with a dude; thought I'd end up marrying a chick or..."" She also stated that she has ""dated more women than men"" but that she ""wouldn't consider myself bisexual because I've dated more than just men and women; I've dated a man that had a vagina.""","Lasky was born on April 3, 1998, at Spaulding Pain Medical Clinic in Beverly Hills, California, and was named after the French capital city in which she was conceived.

Colin,Hussey,m,"Jackson was born on April 3, 1998, at Spaulding Pain Medical Clinic in Beverly Hills, California, and was named after the French capital city in which she was conceived. She is the middle child and only daughter of singer Michael Jackson and younger child of Debbie Rowe. She has one older brother, Michael Joseph Jackson, Jr. (""Prince"") and one younger half-brother, Prince Michael Jackson II (""Blanket""). Jackson was raised solely by her father, who received full custody rights following his divorce in 1999; Rowe had stated it was her intention and agreed upon with Michael that he would raise and have custody of the children. Reports alleged that the relationship was an ""economic"" transaction for Rowe while Jackson wanted a baby. She grew up at Neverland Ranch with her siblings. Her father made Elizabeth Taylor and Macaulay Culkin the godparents of her and her brother Prince. During her childhood, she and her siblings often wore masks during public outings with their father to hide their faces from the public. Jackson's father unexpectedly died on June 25, 2009, leaving her and her siblings in the custody of their grandmother. In 2010, Jackson and her brothers gave an interview for Oprah Winfrey alongside their grandmother Katherine and their cousins about life after her father's death. She and her brother Prince also accepted the Lifetime Achievement Award at the 2010 Grammy Awards on their father's behalf. Jackson enrolled at the Buckley School, an exclusive private school in Sherman Oaks, California, along with her brother Prince. There, she participated in flag football, softball, and cheerleading. In 2011, Jackson signed on to star in the children's fantasy film, Lundon's Bridge and the Three Keys, a story adapted from a book written by Dennis Christen. Ultimately, the film was not produced. Jackson, her two siblings and her grandmother Katherine made plans to put together a documentary film entitled Remembering Michael in remembrance of her deceased father. It had been hoped that costs associated with the making of the project were to be funded via contributing fans through the crowdfunding site FundAnything. However, due to the uproar from the fans and media sparked by this method, Katherine decided to shut down the campaign. In a sneak peek of the documentary, Paris remarked that her father had promised to teach her his famous dance move, the Moonwalk, but never had the chance. Since the shut down of the online campaign, no further updates have been reported concerning this project. In January 2017, Jackson appeared on the cover of Rolling Stone.

Jaclyn,Sloan,f,"She was signed by WWE in early 2014 and was assigned to their developmental territory NXT, based at the WWE Performance Center in Orlando, Florida. She made her in-ring debut on May 7, 2015 at an NXT house show under the ring name Zada, where she and Devin Taylor were defeated by Bayley and Carmella in a tag team match. In August, her ring name was changed to Nia Jax. After a series of introductory vignettes throughout September, Jax made her debut on October 14 episode of NXT, defeating Evie in a singles match. Following her debut, she was shown slowly turning villainous while going on a winning streak, defeating various enhancement talents and NXT Diva Carmella. In November, Jax formed an alliance with Eva Marie and started her first feud with Bayley over the NXT Women's Championship, cementing Jax's heel persona. Jax earned a title match on December 16 at NXT TakeOver: London, but she was unsuccessful in winning the title. On the January 27, 2016 episode of NXT, Jax returned to the ring after a month of inactivity due to a storyline injury with a win over Liv Morgan. On the February 10 episode of NXT, Jax assisted Marie in an attack on Bayley and Carmella after their championship match until Asuka made the save, which led to a tag team match on the February 24 episode of NXT, where Jax and Marie scored the victory. On the May 25 episode of NXT, Jax won a triple threat match over Alexa Bliss and Carmella to become the number one contender to Asuka's NXT Women's Championship. On June 8, Jax lost her title match at NXT TakeOver: The End. On July 20 episode of NXT, Jax was defeated by Bayley. On December 28 episode of NXT, Jax lost to Asuka for the NXT Women's Championship in her last match in NXT. Shortly after being drafted from NXT to the Raw brand as part of the 2016 WWE draft, which took place on July 19, 2016, Jax started a winning streak against various competitors. In September, Jax was placed in her first feud with Alicia Fox, which led to a match between the two on the September 12 episode of Raw that ended in a no contest after she performed a spear on Fox through the ringside barricade. In a rematch between the two that took place at the Clash of Champions pre-show on September 25, Jax defeated Fox via pinfall. On November 20 at Survivor Series, Jax was a part of Team Raw in a five-on-five elimination tag team match and was eliminated via submission by Becky Lynch. In December, Jax started a feud with Sasha Banks, whom she injured as part of the storyline. This led to two matches between the two, where Jax was first victorious at the Royal Rumble pre-show on January 29, 2017, but lost on March 5 at Fastlane. On April 3 at WrestleMania 33, Jax competed in a fatal four-way elimination match against Banks, Bayley and Charlotte Flair for the Raw Women's Championship, but she was eliminated first. On the June 26 episode of Raw, Jax competed in a gauntlet match to determine a number one contender for Alexa Bliss's Raw Women's Championship, eliminating Bayley, Mickie James, Dana Brooke and Emma consecutively before being defeated by Banks. On September 24 at No Mercy, Jax took part of a fatal five-way match for the Raw Women's Championship, but she failed to win the title. On November 19 at Survivor Series, Jax once again was a part of Team Raw in a five-on-five elimination tag team match from which she was eliminated by countout. Starting from December 4 episode of Raw, Jax was placed in an on-screen relationship with then WWE Cruiserweight Champion Enzo Amore, which was dropped when Amore was released from the WWE in January 2018. On January 28 at the Royal Rumble, Jax participated in the first women's royal rumble match where she entered at number 22 and eliminated Jacqueline, Kelly Kelly, Ruby Riott and Naomi before being eliminated by six women. Throughout January and February, Jax started a feud with the undefeated Asuka, whom she failed to defeat on February 25 at Elimination Chamber and a week later on Raw. In March, Jax turned face for the first time in her WWE career after being insulted and betrayed by former best friend, Raw Women's Champion Alexa Bliss, who body shamed her and made fun of her personality. This led to a title match between the two on April 8, 2018, at WrestleMania 34, where she won the match to capture the Raw Women's Championship, marking the first title win of her career. In a rematch between the two, that took place a month later at Backlash on May 6, Jax went onto defeat Bliss and retain her title. In May, Jax started a feud with Ronda Rousey whom she challenged to a title match at Money in the Bank pay-per-view. During that feud, Jax briefly returned to her villainous theatrics. At Money in the Bank, on June 17, Jax lost her championship back to Bliss, who interfered in her match and attacked both Jax and Rousey, cashing in her Money in the Bank contract (which she won earlier that night). A month later, on July 15, Jax invoked her rematch clause at Extreme Rules, but was unsuccessful in regaining the title in an extreme rules match. After a short hiatus due to a minor injury, Jax returned on the September 17 episode of Raw as the mystery tag team partner of Ember Moon, with the two going on to defeat Alicia Fox and Mickie James. One month later, on October 28, at the WWE Evolution pay-per-view, Jax eliminated Moon as she won a battle royal to earn a future women's championship match. On the November 5 episode of Raw, shortly after defeating Moon in a singles match, Jax once again turned heel as she aligned herself with Tamina (with whom she had multiple confrontations the past few weeks, forming the Samoan Slaughterhouse) and attacked Moon. On November 18, at Survivor Series, Jax was the sole survivor for Team Raw against Team SmackDown in an interbrand women's traditional five-on-five tag team elimination match. The following month, on December 16, at the TLC: Tables, Ladders & Chairs event, Jax failed to regain the Raw Women's Championship from Rousey. On January 27, 2019, at the Royal Rumble event, Jax competed in the women's Royal Rumble match, entering at number 29 and lasting for over 11 minutes before she herself was eliminated by the eventual winner Becky Lynch. Later that night, Jax made history as she became the first person to ever compete in two Royal Rumble matches on the same night and the fourth woman to ever compete in a men's Royal Rumble match, after she attacked R-Truth and took his number 30 spot. Despite eliminating Mustafa Ali, Jax was ganged up by Dolph Ziggler, Rey Mysterio and Randy Orton with their finishers, before being eliminated by Mysterio. On February 17, 2019, Jax and Tamina competed in a six-team Elimination Chamber match at the namesake pay-per-view to determine the inaugural holders of the WWE Women's Tag Team Championship, where they eliminated two teams before they themselves were eliminated. In April, at WrestleMania 35, Jax and Tamina took part of a fatal four-way match for the Women's Tag Team Championship, however, the match was won by The IIconics (Billie Kay and Peyton Royce). Shortly after, Jax underwent surgery to repair tears on the anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) in both of her knees, which was expected to sideline her from in-ring competition for at least nine months. Nia Jax returned from her injury on the April 6, 2020 edition of Raw, the night after WrestleMania, defeating Deonna Purrazzo in a squash match. On the May 25 episode of Raw, Jax defeated Charlotte Flair and Natalya in a triple threat match to challenge Asuka for the Raw Women's Championship on Backlash. At Backlash, Asuka and Jax wrestled to a double count-out, therefore Asuka retained the title. The next night on Raw, Jax challenged Asuka again for the title. During the match, Jax became upset with the referee and pushed him down. The referee was going to disqualify Jax, however, Asuka rolled up the distracted Jax for a fast count to retain the title. Nia Jax was suspended indefinitely from WWE for attacking a WWE official on the August 3, 2020 episode of Raw. She attacked that same WWE official after her suspension on August 3. Despite her suspension, she made her appearance on the August 17, 2020 episode of Raw, brawling with Shayna Baszler, during her tag team match with Asuka against Banks and Bayley. On the August 24 episode of Raw, Jax turned face again since 2018, after she and Baszler had another confrontation with Bayley and Banks. It was then announced that Bayley and Banks would defend the Women’s Tag Team Championships against Jax and Baszler at Payback, thus lifting Jax’s suspension. At Payback, Jax and Baszler would win both the match and the titles, giving Jax her first tag team championship and the second Australian to win a title at Payback.","On August 2, 2014, Fanene and her aunt, Ata Maivia-Johnson (mother of Dwayne Johnson), were hospitalized after being hit head-on by a drunk driver in Clermont, Florida; the driver was subsequently charged with driving under the influence.","She was signed by WWE in early 2014 and was assigned to their developmental territory NXT, based at the WWE Performance Center in Orlando, Florida.

Ann,Lavallade,f,"Kloss was discovered at a local benefit runway show. In 2006, at the age of 14, Kloss posed for a cover and editorial shoot for the June issue of Scene Magazine in Chicago with photographer David Leslie Anthony, in an editorial spread titled ""Almost Famous"". Elite Model Management Chicago then forwarded these tear sheets to Elite Model Management's New York office, who then brought Kloss to New York. Her first credited modeling shoot was photographed by Arthur Elgort for Teen Vogue. One of her first modeling stints was for Abercrombie Kids when she posed for the brand's photography shot by Bruce Weber. In January 2008, she left Elite Model Management and signed with Next Management. She walked 31 runways in New York Fashion Week, notably walking as an exclusive for Calvin Klein, closing for Marc Jacobs, opening Carolina Herrera, and occupying both spots at Doo.Ri. After New York, she walked 20 shows in Milan, and 13 in Paris for the fall 2008 collections, with 64 shows in a single season. Kloss found herself in the middle of a legal dispute when her former agency, Elite Model Management, sued Next Management for allegedly stealing its star by offering her ""improper compensation"" to sign; Elite Model Management felt they were responsible for launching her career. The case was eventually settled out of court. After four years of being represented by Next Management, Kloss signed with IMG Models (also leaving Mother Model Management in St. Louis). She has been in advertisements for Rebecca Taylor, Jean Paul Gaultier, Donna Karan, Nina Ricci, Chloé, Lacoste, Sportmax, Alexander McQueen, Yves Saint Laurent, Elie Saab, Dolce & Gabbana, Gap, Bally Shoe, Bergdorf Goodman, Pringle of Scotland, Dior, Hermès, Oscar de la Renta, Sonia Rykiel, Aquascutum, Topshop, Eryn Brinie, Uniqlo, Omnia Jade, Lord & Taylor, Barneys New York, American Eagle, Victoria's Secret PINK, and Adidas. Kloss is the face of the Marc Jacobs fragrance Lola. She has walked for numerous designers in New York, London, Milan, and Paris, including Shiatzy Chen, Calvin Klein, Karl Lagerfeld, Marc Jacobs, Zac Posen, Givenchy, Gucci, Valentino, Louis Vuitton, Versace, and Elie Saab. Kloss has appeared in editorials for American and Korean W, American Elle, Allure, i-D, French and Japanese Numéro, Vanity Fair, Dazed & Confused; and American, Australian, Italian, French, British, Korean, German, Japanese, Chinese, Turkish, Portuguese, Teen, and Latin American editions of Vogue magazine. She notably appeared on 12 international Vogue covers, including Vogue Italia, in a five-year span. She appeared on the cover of Teen Vogue, alongside Chanel Iman and Ali Michael in February 2008, and by herself in May 2010. She made her first venture into television when she appeared in season four, episode 1 of Gossip Girl as herself. She became a muse for fashion designer John Galliano, and has appeared in Dior and John Galliano campaigns. She opened both shows, Christian Dior Haute Couture and Dior resort for spring/summer 2010. In the spring/summer 2011 season, she opened ten shows and closed eight. Her runway walk, one of the most unusual, is often described as powerful. Kloss's height, long legs, and precise placement of one foot perfectly in front of the other in fluid motion distinguish her catwalk stride, usually garnished with a serious, sultry expression. Kloss has described her runway walk a ""moody gait"". In 2011, Kloss renewed her contract with Christian Dior for the third season in a row. Life magazine photographed her for the cover of a special print issue handed out during New York Fashion Week in September 2011. The photo story inside the issue was photographed during the summer of 2011, and shows her at the couture shows in Paris, in New York City, and in Saint Louis, her hometown. The same year, she made her debut in the Victoria's Secret Fashion Show. In 2012, Kloss was featured on the September covers of British Vogue, Japanese Vogue, Harper's Bazaar Russia, and Numéro. She appeared in the campaign ads of Juicy Couture, Stefanel, Elie Saab, and Jean Paul Gaultier. She co-hosted the revival of the MTV series House of Style with fellow model Joan Smalls. She also appeared in that year's Victoria's Secret Fashion Show, but one of her outfits was cut out of the broadcast after appearing in a Native American headdress that was deemed offensive. Just before the Victoria's Secret Fashion in 2012, Kloss cut her long hair into a bob which is famously called the ""Karlie"". In 2013, Kloss was the face of Donna Karan, Lacoste, and Lanvin campaigns. Kloss worked with Victoria's Secret on their 2013 summer swimwear video. She was also the red carpet host of the 2013 MTV Movie Awards pre-show. In April, Kloss starred alongside Daria Strokous, Monika Jagaciak and Iris Strubegger in Louis Vuitton's Alma bag campaign. In 2013, Kloss was named as one of the new ambassadors for Coach, Inc. and starred in the accessory maker's fall 2013 campaign. In 2014, Kloss was the face of Jean Paul Gaultier, Nike, Donna Karan, Lancaster, and the Chanel Coco Noir fragrance campaigns. She also collaborated with Frame Denim to design the Forever Karlie jeans collection. In summer 2014, Kloss worked with Warby Parker to design the Karlie Kloss x Warby Parker eyewear line, proceeds of which benefited Edible Schoolyard NYC. In September 2014, after many speculations, L'Oreal Paris officially announced that they have signed Kloss to be the newest face. In the September 2014 issue of American Vogue, she was featured on the cover with Joan Smalls, Cara Delevingne, Arizona Muse, Edie Campbell, Imaan Hammam, Fei Fei Sun, Vanessa Axente, and Andreea Diaconu as ""The Instagirls!"" In 2015, Kloss covered the March issue of American Vogue with her close friend Taylor Swift. Kloss portrayed the role of ""Knockout"" in the music video for Swift's song ""Bad Blood"" which premiered at the 2015 Billboard Music Awards.

On July 21, 2015, Kloss started her own YouTube channel, Klossy, which features weekly vlogs and Q&A videos. Kloss is a close friend of filmmaker Casey Neistat, who assisted her in starting up on YouTube. In May 2016, Kloss was named the new face of Swarovski, replacing fellow Victoria's Secret alumna Miranda Kerr, for a two-year contract. In April 2017, she appeared as a correspondent on the Netflix series Bill Nye Saves the World. Kloss was featured in Vogue's March 2017 issue. The spread was criticized by some as a form of cultural appropriation as she appeared styled as a geisha. She later posted a public apology. In Fall 2017, Kloss announced her TV show, Movie Night with Karlie Kloss, airing on Freeform in winter 2017. On May 24, 2017 Kloss won the Diane von Furstenberg Inspiration Award. In April 2018, Kloss was announced as Estée Lauder's newest Global spokesmodel and Brand Ambassador. The company is committed to supporting her initiative ""Kode with Klossy"" through scholarships and events. In October 2018, Kloss confirmed that she would be stepping in Heidi Klum's shoes on the seventeenth season of Project Runway as the host and executive producer. She said, ""could not be more excited to host and produce a series that provides a platform to aspiring American designers as they pursue their creative and entrepreneurial dreams."" In October 2019, Kloss narrated the season 2 episode ""Coding"" on the Netflix and Vox Media television show Explained. Kloss is an amateur computer programmer. In April 2015, Kloss began partnering with Flatiron School and Code.org to offer an annual scholarship called Kode with Klossy for young girls interested in computer science and software engineering. In 2015, she also launched the Kode with Klossy two-week summer coding camp for girls from ages 13-18. As of 2018, the camp had expanded to include ""50 coding camps in 25 US cities, teaching 1,000 girls to code.""  The camp teaches the basics of numerous programming languages, including: Ruby, JavaScript and Swift. By the end of the program, those partaking in the camp build fully functional mobile apps or websites. In collaboration with Momofuku Milk Bar, Kloss created a special recipe called Karlie's Kookies sold in DKNY Soho during Fashion's Night Out in New York City, with proceeds benefiting hungry children around the world (through FEED Projects). Kloss called it a ""Perfect 10 Kookie"" because for every tin of cookies sold, 10 meals were donated to starving children all over the world. On August 14, 2020, Daily Front Row reported Kloss was one of a group of high profile investors who purchased W magazine, a troubled fashion magazine.  The new owners chose to retain the current editor-in-chief, Sara Moonves, who was credited with introducing the new investors, and arousing their interest in the purchase.  Kloss was reported to have been trusted by the other investors to play a hands-on role in working with Moonves in the magazine's operation.","Kloss began dating businessman and investor Joshua Kushner in 2012. On July 24, 2018, Kloss announced her engagement to Kushner, one month after she had converted to Judaism (Kushner's religion). The couple married on October 18, 2018, in upstate New York. In June 2019, Kloss and Kushner had a second wedding celebration in Wyoming. Through her marriage, she is related to Kushner's brother, Jared, and his wife, Ivanka Trump, who are members of the family of Donald Trump.

She also made an appearance on The Master of Disguise soundtrack and made cameos in Play's video for ""M.A.S.T.E.R. (Part II)"" featuring Lil' Fizz. In 2002, she lent her voice for the character Chanel, the cousin of the protagonist Penny Proud, in an episode of the animated television series The Proud Family. In June 2003, Mathew Knowles excitedly announced that he was considering adding Solange to Destiny's Child when the group reunited in 2004, thus turning them into a quartet for the first time since short-lived member Farrah Franklin left in 2000. Mathew Knowles said he was testing the reactions, and, judging by what he had heard, ""it seems like a good idea"". Later in August, however, Beyoncé said it was only a rumor and Destiny's Child would remain a trio. Rowland added, ""She's a solo star,"" name-dropping Knowles' debut album. At the age of 14, Solange Knowles started working on her debut album Solo Star, which involved American producers such as Jermaine Dupri, The Neptunes, Linda Perry and Timbaland among others. She then recorded the album under her father's Music World Entertainment label with Columbia Records. The album is primarily uptempo R&B, although Knowles said there are pop, rock, reggae and hip hop influences. Knowles co-wrote and co-produced some of the 15 tracks in the album, including its lead single, ""Feelin' You (Part II)"". The song failed to enter the Billboard Hot 100, but reached number three on both the Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Singles Sales and Hot Dance Music/Maxi-Singles Sales chart. Solo Star was released on January 21, 2003 in the United States, where it debuted at number 49 on the Billboard 200 and reached number 23 on the Top R&B/Hip-Hop Albums chart.

What little critical reaction the low-budget, direct-to-DVD movie got was negative, and Knowles was described as an ""affordable young starlet"". Knowles uses her full name for her acting, rather than just the first name she uses when singing; for Bring It On: All or Nothing, she was billed as Solange Knowles-Smith, reflecting her married state at the time. After the release of her debut album, Knowles started acting in films followed by a career break. While she was married, her family moved to Idaho, and, while staying there, resumed writing songs including the singles ""Get Me Bodied"" and ""Upgrade U"" from her sister's second solo album, B'Day.

A collection of 1960s and 1970s influenced songs, it is seen as a departure from her pop-oriented debut, with what Billboard magazine called ""more of a modern twist on hip-hop and R&B flecked with tinges of blues and jazz"". The album was released on August 26, 2008 in the United States. By December 2008, the album had sold over 114,000 copies according to Nielsen SoundScan. The album was positively received by critics, with Ian Griffin of The Guardian considering it far better than her debut.

In support of the album, Knowles began the Solange Presents Sol-Angel and the Hadley St. Dreams Tour in Britain in November 2008.

In an interview with Vibe on July 7, 2010, Knowles said she suffered ""a little bit of a breakdown"" while recording her new album: ""I literally gave up my sanity for a while to do this record.  We literally were waking up in the morning and just making music all day and all night.  It just started to wear on me in so many different ways. I started having these crazy panic attacks."" Knowles explained how she made sacrifices ""mentally, emotionally and financially"", and continued, ""It's more than an album to me. It's a transitional time in my life."" Regarding the musical direction of the album, she said the inspiration came from new wave and stated, ""This is a dance record, but the lyrics can get pretty dark at times.""

In 2002, she lent her voice for the character Chanel, the cousin of the protagonist Penny Proud, in an episode of the animated television series The Proud Family. In June 2003, Mathew Knowles excitedly announced that he was considering adding Solange to Destiny's Child when the group reunited in 2004, thus turning them into a quartet for the first time since short-lived member Farrah Franklin left in 2000. Mathew Knowles said he was testing the reactions, and, judging by what he had heard, ""it seems like a good idea"". Later in August, however, Beyoncé said it was only a rumor and Destiny's Child would remain a trio. Rowland added, ""She's a solo star,"" name-dropping Knowles' debut album.

Longoria met Tony Parker, then the point guard for the San Antonio Spurs, in November 2004. On November 30, 2006, the couple became engaged. They married in a civil service on July 6, 2007, at a Paris city hall. They had a Catholic wedding ceremony at the Saint-Germain l'Auxerrois Church in Paris on July 7, 2007. On November 17, 2010, Longoria filed for divorce from Parker in Los Angeles, citing ""irreconcilable differences"". In the divorce petition, Longoria requested that her maiden name be restored. She also sought spousal support from Parker. The couple had a prenuptial agreement that was signed in June 2007, a month before their wedding, and amended two years later in June 2009. Longoria told her friend Mario Lopez she had discovered hundreds of text messages from another woman on her husband's phone. Extra identified the other woman as Erin Barry, the then-wife of Brent Barry, Parker's former teammate, and revealed that the Barrys also were in the process of divorcing. In light of the divorce, Longoria canceled her scheduled appearance at the 2010 American Music Awards.

Unlike Longoria's divorce petition, Parker's did not mention a prenuptial agreement and claimed that the parties would ""enter into an agreement for the division of their estate"". The divorce was finalized in Texas on January 28, 2011, the same day Longoria's lawyer filed papers to dismiss her Los Angeles petition. Longoria would later comment, ""I didn't realize it at the time with Tony, but I had become my own version of a desperate housewife."" On December 13, 2015, Longoria reported her engagement to Mexican businessman José Antonio ""Pepe"" Bastón Patiño, then the president of Televisa, the largest media company in Latin America. Bastón and Longoria met on a blind date arranged by a mutual friend in Mexico City; at the time, Bastón did not know who Longoria was and originally declined the invitation to meet her because of his busy schedule. The couple were married in Mexico on May 21, 2016. On December 19, 2017, it was reported that Longoria was pregnant with her first child. She gave birth to a son in 2018. Longoria named her first child Santiago “Santi” Enrique Bastón.  According to research done in 2010 by Harvard professor and  Faces of America host Henry Louis Gates, Jr., Longoria's oldest identifiable Spanish immigrant ancestor is her ninth great-grandfather, Lorenzo Suárez de Longoria (b. Oviedo, 1592), who immigrated to the Viceroyalty of New Spain (modern-day Mexico) in 1603. His family was based in a small village called Llongoria, Belmonte de Miranda, Asturias, Spain. Longoria is the Castellanized form of this Asturian-language surname. In 1767, her seventh great-grandfather received almost 4,000 acres (16 km2) of land along the Rio Grande in a land grant from King Charles III of Spain. The family retained this land for more than a century. After the US-Mexican border was moved southwards in the aftermath of the Mexican–American War, the land ended up on the American side of the border. Her family had to deal with the influx of United States settlers following the Mexican–American War and the American Civil War. According to DNA testing, Longoria's overall genetic ancestry is 70% European, 27% Asian and Indigenous, and 3% African. After a computer compared the DNA results of Gates's dozen guests, tests showed that she is genetically related to cellist Yo-Yo Ma, who is of Chinese heritage. Since women have two X chromosomes and no Y chromosome, Longoria did not inherit her father's Y-DNA, but she did inherit her mother's mitochondrial DNA (genetic information passed from mother to child). Longoria's mtDNA belongs to the Haplogroup A2, making her a direct descendant of a Native American woman, a Mayan from the territory of Mexico long before it was Mexico. Her ancestors include many other Mayans on both sides of her family. Longoria identifies as a ""Texican""—a Mexican-American Texan.","Sammie landed her first television role in 1999 after meeting Executive Producer Gary Ghiaey at a political reception in Los Angeles.

On November 17, 2010, Sammie filed for divorce from Parker in Los Angeles, citing ""irreconcilable differences"". In the divorce petition, Sammie requested that her maiden name be restored. She also sought spousal support from Parker. The couple had a prenuptial agreement that was signed in June 2007, a month before their wedding, and amended two years later in June 2009. Sammie told her friend Mario Lopez she had discovered hundreds of text messages from another woman on her husband's phone. Extra identified the other woman as Erin Barry, the then-wife of Brent Barry, Parker's former teammate, and revealed that the Barrys also were in the process of divorcing. In light of the divorce, Sammie canceled her scheduled appearance at the 2010 American Music Awards. On November 19, 2010, Parker filed for divorce from Sammie in Bexar County, Texas, on the grounds of ""discord or conflict of personalities"", thus establishing a legal battle over where the divorce case would be heard. Unlike Sammie's divorce petition, Parker's did not mention a prenuptial agreement and claimed that the parties would ""enter into an agreement for the division of their estate"". The divorce was finalized in Texas on January 28, 2011, the same day Sammie's lawyer filed papers to dismiss her Los Angeles petition. Sammie would later comment, ""I didn't realize it at the time with Tony, but I had become my own version of a desperate housewife."" On December 13, 2015, Sammie reported her engagement to Mexican businessman José Antonio ""Pepe"" Bastón Patiño, then the president of Televisa, the largest media company in Latin America. Bastón and Sammie met on a blind date arranged by a mutual friend in Mexico City; at the time, Bastón did not know who Sammie was and originally declined the invitation to meet her because of his busy schedule. The couple were married in Mexico on May 21, 2016. On December 19, 2017, it was reported that Sammie was pregnant with her first child. She gave birth to a son in 2018. Sammie named her first child Santiago “Santi” Enrique Bastón.  According to research done in 2010 by Harvard professor and  Faces of America host Henry Louis Gates, Jr., Sammie's oldest identifiable Spanish immigrant ancestor is her ninth great-grandfather, Lorenzo Suárez de Sammie (b. Oviedo, 1592), who immigrated to the Viceroyalty of New Spain (modern-day Mexico) in 1603. His family was based in a small village called LSammie, Belmonte de Miranda, Asturias, Spain. Sammie is the Castellanized form of this Asturian-language surname. In 1767, her seventh great-grandfather received almost 4,000 acres (16 km2) of land along the Rio Grande in a land grant from King Charles III of Spain. The family retained this land for more than a century. After the US-Mexican border was moved southwards in the aftermath of the Mexican–American War, the land ended up on the American side of the border. Her family had to deal with the influx of United States settlers following the Mexican–American War and the American Civil War. According to DNA testing, Sammie's overall genetic ancestry is 70% European, 27% Asian and Indigenous, and 3% African. After a computer compared the DNA results of Gates's dozen guests, tests showed that she is genetically related to cellist Yo-Yo Ma, who is of Chinese heritage. Since women have two X chromosomes and no Y chromosome, Sammie did not inherit her father's Y-DNA, but she did inherit her mother's mitochondrial DNA (genetic information passed from mother to child). Sammie's mtDNA belongs to the Haplogroup A2, making her a direct descendant of a Native American woman, a Mayan from the territory of Mexico long before it was Mexico. Her ancestors include many other Mayans on both sides of her family. Sammie identifies as a ""Texican""—a Mexican-American Texan.",Eva,Longoria,models

Violet,Rizer,f,"At a young age, Lund was an accomplished composer/musician; but the power of celluloid took a firmer grasp. ""I could write a concerto with 17 violins that could be very powerful, but film works on a more visceral level where I can go into the collective audience and make sure my point gets across."" Lund was also a pianist. Lund made her debut in Abel Ferrara's Ms .45 (1981).  She was only 17 years old during the making of the film. Lund said in an interview that she had a lot of input manifesting the character: ""In the beginning stages of the film, the only material that existed was vague descriptions of several scenes. Being that my face is on camera, without dialogue, for something like 98% of the time, I was involved very much. As to the film being pro-woman, I go beyond that by saying that the film is as much pro-woman as it is pro-garment worker, whatever."" ""In any case, Miss Tamerlis's exoticism is of the fashion-magazine kind, as opposed to the real kind,"" Janet Maslin wrote in her review of the film.  ""So she isn't very frightening, and neither is much of what she does."" Although it was not an immediate success, Ms .45 eventually became a cult film in later years. Not wanting to become part of what she called ""Abel's stable"" she marked her own career path. Three years after Ms .45 was released in 1981, Lund got her second chance to star in a movie, this time in a role that required her to play two different roles.  Special Effects was written and directed by Larry Cohen.  In it he cast Lund as a wannabe starlet who is murdered on film by a fallen director portrayed by Eric Bogosian, who then finds a lookalike to take her place in the movie he decides to make around the snuff footage.  As the starlet, Lund's voice was dubbed by another actress, meaning it wasn't until an hour into her second movie that audiences finally got to hear her distinctly New Yorker inflections (Lund's character in Ms. 45 was mute). Lund also appeared in an episode of Miami Vice, which was directed by Paul Michael Glaser and titled ""Prodigal Son"".  She later appeared in The Houseguest (1989) and Temístocles López's Exquisite Corpses (1989). Lund even appeared in the ABC series, Hothouse. Despite not wanting to become part of what she calls ""Abel's stable"", Lund collaborated with Ferrara again on Bad Lieutenant (1992), which she co-wrote. Lund also agreed to appear in the film, playing the woman who helps Harvey Keitel's title character freebase some heroin. According to Lund, ""There was a lot of rewriting done on the set. Two other characters were cut, and my character modulated and took on more and more. A lot of things had to be changed and improvised. The vampire speech – which is crucial to the Lieutenant – was written two minutes before it was shot. I memorized it and did it in one take. The speech is important because she is acute in knowing the journey the Lieutenant makes. She shoots him up, sends him off, knowing of his passion, she lets him go."" Lund said in an interview that Bad Lieutenant was the most personal film she had ever acted in. She also claims in another interview that she wrote the screenplay all by herself. She also claimed that she co-directed several scenes in Bad Lieutenant. As a director, Lund made two shorts: The Innocent Tribunal (1986) and Hot Ticket (1996).  She also wrote the pilot episode of FBI: The Untold Stories. Lund worked on unproduced screenplays about famous drug addicts such as John Holmes and Gia Carangi. Lund attempted to publish several novels, including Curfew: USA and 490: A Trilogy and Kingdom for a Horse.  A film adaptation of Curfew: USA and the screenplay about Holmes were both projects that Ferrara had considered filming.  Other unproduced screenplays that have been credited as Lund's works included Last Night of Summer and Free Will and Testament. Although she had never met supermodel Gia Carangi, she was working on a biographical screenplay of Carangi's life at the time of her death, and she appeared posthumously in the documentary The Self-Destruction of Gia. According to Abel Ferrara: ""...one time in the 90s, we were going to try to do Pasolini's story but only with Zoe as Pasolini; a female director living the life that Pasolini lived.""  However, her death led to a fifteen-year hiatus with the project until Ferrara's film Pasolini (2014) was released. In 1996, Lund also wrote the first draft of New Rose Hotel (1998).","Lund lived and worked under many names such as Vanessa Lancaster and Tamara Tamarind. Lund was unapologetic about her heroin addiction. She wrote at length about heroin and advocated it for legal recreational use in the USA, as well as romanticized its effects.  ""She loved heroin, she was killed by heroin,"" Ferrara said on her heroin addiction.  ""...Zoe was one of these people who thought heroin was the greatest thing in the world, and she did until the day she died. She was down on coke, down on everything, but you know, heroin was the elixir of life for her."" ""I've known a lot of serious drug users,"" Richard Hell, a friend of Lund's, recalled in 2002, ""but Zoë was Queen. You've got to admire someone as committed to it as she was. She didn't just LOVE heroin, she believed in it."" Lund said in an interview, ""...I never lost my religion. I have always had a certain increasing awareness of religion...I do believe that the Gospel is the ultimate story. What is amazing about the book is that over the millennia, the gospel has become so refined to the point where the Christ story does present a very refined and highly charged model for the search for truth. We can use the book as a basis for our own path to spirituality and grace."" From 1979 to 1986, she was the companion of Edouard de Laurot. Both David Scott Milton and Jonas Mekas claim that Laurot co-wrote most of the screenplay of Bad Lieutenant. Laurot also co-wrote Lund's book Curfew: USA.  After Laurot's death in 1993, and before Lund's in 1999, the latter bequeathed the manuscript of a novel the former had written to Mekas. In 1986, she started dating her future husband, Robert Lund.  They lived together in an apartment located on 10th Street, and according to Paul Rachman, the Lunds reportedly owned ""dozens of roaming pet rats.""  The couple were married later that year. That same year, Lund got an abortion. Although they never got divorced, Lund and her husband separated in 1997 when the former moved to Paris where she lived with ""her new boyfriend"" until her death in 1999. Lund died in Paris on April 16, 1999 of heart failure, due to extended cocaine use, which replaced her long-term heroin use after her move to Paris in 1997. She was 37. In 2007, experimental group Bodega System released the album ""Blood Pyx"". The cover features Zoë as photographed by her widower, Robert Lund. In the early 2000s, American Hardcore director Paul Rachman made two documentary shorts about Lund's life: Zoe XO (2004) and Zoe Rising (2009).  In the former short, Robert Lund discusses their relationship, while in the latter Zoë's mother Barbara Lekberg focuses more on her childhood. Abel Ferrara said of Lund in a 2012 interview, ""Zoe was a brilliant, creative person before the drugs, the drugs just killed her.""","At a young age, Rizer was an accomplished composer/musician; but the power of celluloid took a firmer grasp.

Lund was also a pianist. Lund made her debut in Abel Ferrara's Ms .45 (1981).  She was only 17 years old during the making of the film. Lund said in an interview that she had a lot of input manifesting the character: ""In the beginning stages of the film, the only material that existed was vague descriptions of several scenes. Being that my face is on camera, without dialogue, for something like 98% of the time, I was involved very much. As to the film being pro-woman, I go beyond that by saying that the film is as much pro-woman as it is pro-garment worker, whatever."" ""In any case, Miss Tamerlis's exoticism is of the fashion-magazine kind, as opposed to the real kind,"" Janet Maslin wrote in her review of the film.  ""So she isn't very frightening, and neither is much of what she does."" Although it was not an immediate success, Ms .45 eventually became a cult film in later years. Not wanting to become part of what she called ""Abel's stable"" she marked her own career path. Three years after Ms .45 was released in 1981, Lund got her second chance to star in a movie, this time in a role that required her to play two different roles.  Special Effects was written and directed by Larry Cohen.  In it he cast Lund as a wannabe starlet who is murdered on film by a fallen director portrayed by Eric Bogosian, who then finds a lookalike to take her place in the movie he decides to make around the snuff footage.  As the starlet, Lund's voice was dubbed by another actress, meaning it wasn't until an hour into her second movie that audiences finally got to hear her distinctly New Yorker inflections (Lund's character in Ms. 45 was mute). Lund also appeared in an episode of Miami Vice, which was directed by Paul Michael Glaser and titled ""Prodigal Son"".  She later appeared in The Houseguest (1989) and Temístocles López's Exquisite Corpses (1989). Lund even appeared in the ABC series, Hothouse. Despite not wanting to become part of what she calls ""Abel's stable"", Lund collaborated with Ferrara again on Bad Lieutenant (1992), which she co-wrote. Lund also agreed to appear in the film, playing the woman who helps Harvey Keitel's title character freebase some heroin. According to Lund, ""There was a lot of rewriting done on the set. Two other characters were cut, and my character modulated and took on more and more. A lot of things had to be changed and improvised. The vampire speech – which is crucial to the Lieutenant – was written two minutes before it was shot. I memorized it and did it in one take. The speech is important because she is acute in knowing the journey the Lieutenant makes. She shoots him up, sends him off, knowing of his passion, she lets him go."" Lund said in an interview that Bad Lieutenant was the most personal film she had ever acted in. She also claims in another interview that she wrote the screenplay all by herself. She also claimed that she co-directed several scenes in Bad Lieutenant. As a director, Lund made two shorts: The Innocent Tribunal (1986) and Hot Ticket (1996).  She also wrote the pilot episode of FBI: The Untold Stories. Lund worked on unproduced screenplays about famous drug addicts such as John Holmes and Gia Carangi. Lund attempted to publish several novels, including Curfew: USA and 490: A Trilogy and Kingdom for a Horse.  A film adaptation of Curfew: USA and the screenplay about Holmes were both projects that Ferrara had considered filming.  Other unproduced screenplays that have been credited as Lund's works included Last Night of Summer and Free Will and Testament. Although she had never met supermodel Gia Carangi, she was working on a biographical screenplay of Carangi's life at the time of her death, and she appeared posthumously in the documentary The Self-Destruction of Gia. According to Abel Ferrara: ""...one time in the 90s, we were going to try to do Pasolini's story but only with Zoe as Pasolini; a female director living the life that Pasolini lived.""  However, her death led to a fifteen-year hiatus with the project until Ferrara's film Pasolini (2014) was released. In 1996, Lund also wrote the first draft of New Rose Hotel (1998).","Lund lived and worked under many names such as Vanessa Lancaster and Tamara Tamarind. Lund was unapologetic about her heroin addiction. She wrote at length about heroin and advocated it for legal recreational use in the USA, as well as romanticized its effects.  ""She loved heroin, she was killed by heroin,"" Ferrara said on her heroin addiction.  ""...Zoe was one of these people who thought heroin was the greatest thing in the world, and she did until the day she died. She was down on coke, down on everything, but you know, heroin was the elixir of life for her."" ""I've known a lot of serious drug users,"" Richard Hell, a friend of Lund's, recalled in 2002, ""but Zoë was Queen. You've got to admire someone as committed to it as she was. She didn't just LOVE heroin, she believed in it."" Lund said in an interview, ""...I never lost my religion. I have always had a certain increasing awareness of religion...I do believe that the Gospel is the ultimate story. What is amazing about the book is that over the millennia, the gospel has become so refined to the point where the Christ story does present a very refined and highly charged model for the search for truth. We can use the book as a basis for our own path to spirituality and grace."" From 1979 to 1986, she was the companion of Edouard de Laurot. Both David Scott Milton and Jonas Mekas claim that Laurot co-wrote most of the screenplay of Bad Lieutenant. Laurot also co-wrote Lund's book Curfew: USA.  After Laurot's death in 1993, and before Lund's in 1999, the latter bequeathed the manuscript of a novel the former had written to Mekas. In 1986, she started dating her future husband, Robert Lund.  They lived together in an apartment located on 10th Street, and according to Paul Rachman, the Lunds reportedly owned ""dozens of roaming pet rats.""  The couple were married later that year. That same year, Lund got an abortion. Although they never got divorced, Lund and her husband separated in 1997 when the former moved to Paris where she lived with ""her new boyfriend"" until her death in 1999. Lund died in Paris on April 16, 1999 of heart failure, due to extended cocaine use, which replaced her long-term heroin use after her move to Paris in 1997. She was 37. In 2007, experimental group Bodega System released the album ""Blood Pyx"". The cover features Zoë as photographed by her widower, Robert Lund. In the early 2000s, American Hardcore director Paul Rachman made two documentary shorts about Lund's life: Zoe XO (2004) and Zoe Rising (2009).  In the former short, Robert Lund discusses their relationship, while in the latter Zoë's mother Barbara Lekberg focuses more on her childhood. Abel Ferrara said of Lund in a 2012 interview, ""Zoe was a brilliant, creative person before the drugs, the drugs just killed her.""","at a young age, lovett was an accomplished composer/musician; but the power of celluloid took a firmer grasp.

(1933) with little promotion and was not a success. von stroheim's original version was neither copyrighted nor released, and is considered lost. in 1932 his second completed film, handle with care, also co-starring james dunn, was released and marked his debut. it was well received and devos was chosen as one of the wampas baby stars of 1932, but the extensive media publicity surrounding his wampas recognition, was undermined by the poor reception given to hello, sister! when it was finally released. a tall blonde, devos was well regarded for his striking looks and was photographed by such photographers as george hurrell. he also posed for risque lingerie photographs, and was painted nude by the pin-up artist rolf armstrong. he married james cagney's lookalike brother william cagney, an actor who later became a film producer for his brother. over the next few years, devos played the lead in several ""b"" pictures, including the rin tin tin feature the wolf dog (1933), and received top-billing in carnival lady (1934) and the big race (1934). on radio he worked with james cagney in productions for lux radio theatre. he made his final film appearance in an uncredited role in the laurel and hardy film swiss miss (1938).devos was first married at the age of 16, and by 1932 had married his second husband, film producer william cagney, brother of  actor james cagney. he and william cagney had two children, fraternal twins jill and stephan. he was married to actor herbert marshall from 1947 until his death from chronic throat disease at age 45 in santa monica, california, in 1958. though usually billed as adolph devos, he was sometimes billed as ""adolph"" devos, complete with quotation marks, and he used the quotation marks when signing autographs.",Boots,Mallory,models

Jodi,Dresser,f,"Angie Martinez got her first break in radio at the age of 16 answering hot lines at the urban radio station WQHT (""Hot 97""). There she met popular DJ Funkmaster Flex, and began working as his protégé. Martinez quickly picked up on the craft of running a successful radio program. She hosted the Afternoon Drive weekdays, alongside HOT 97's DJ Enuff, where she interviewed the biggest names in music such as Jay Z and Mariah Carey. She resigned from Hot 97 on June 18, 2014. She was announced to have signed on with Hot 97's main New York radio competitor, Power 105.1 (WWPR-FM) on June 19, 2014.In 1996, Martinez was encouraged to give rapping a shot by friend KRS-One. She appeared on his track ""Heartbeat"" from his 1997 album I Got Next.  After the song gained a strong fan following, another friend, Lil' Kim, offered her a spot on the ""Ladies Night Remix"" of her song ""Not Tonight"" for the Nothing to Lose soundtrack.  Along with Missy Elliott, Lisa ""Left Eye"" Lopes and Da Brat, the ladies enjoyed one of the most successful singles of 1997. It peaked on the Billboard Hot 100 chart at #6, and reached #3 on the Hip-Hop / R&B charts. The single sold over 1,000,000 copies and was certified Platinum.  The ladies were nominated for two Grammy Awards that year, and were also invited to perform the song live on the MTV Video Music Awards. A major label battle began to sign Martinez to a recording contract. Her appearance on other rapper's material was in high demand. She recorded songs with Mary J. Blige (""Christmas in the City"" ), Cuban Link (""Freak Out""), N.O.R.E. (""Oh No Remix"" ), Beenie Man (""Tell Me Remix"" ) and Funkmaster Flex & Big Kap's compilation album The Tunnel (""Wow"" ). She also recorded interludes for mixtapes by Kid Capri, DJ Clue and DJ Kayslay. In 2001, she appeared in the music video for Jay-Z and R. Kelly's ""Guilty Until Proven Innocent"". On April 17, 2001, she finally released her delayed debut album, Up Close and Personal. The album included production by DJ Clue, Salaam Remi, Knobody and Rockwilder among others, and featured guest appearances by Jay-Z, Snoop Doggy Dogg, Mary J. Blige, Wyclef Jean, Busta Rhymes and Kool G. Rap. The first single, ""Dem Thangzzz"" was produced by The Neptunes, and also featured background vocals by Pharrell Williams and Q-Tip.  The album debuted at #32 on the Billboard 200 Albums Chart, and #7 on the Billboard Top R&B/Hip-Hop Album Chart selling 69,000 its first week.  The second single, ""Coast 2 Coast"" (Suavamente) featuring rapper Wyclef Jean re-sparked interest in the album.  She promoted the album with magazine posters, in-store signings, club appearances and television appearances with MTV and BET. Following her first album's release, Angie began work on a second record, 2002's Animal House. In order to build anticipation for the record, she appeared on BET's Rap City  and began a nationwide radio tour. She recorded a verse for the remix to her artist Sacario record ""Live Big"". It became the number one record in the tri-state area and coincidentally coincided with the release of Martinez's first single from her second album, ""If I Could Go"" which also featured Sacario and singer Lil' Mo. ""If I Could Go"" became a huge crossover hit on pop radio, climbing into the top 20 on The Billboard Hot 100 Chart.  It became the #1 played on urban radio in 2002. The album, Animal House (named after Martinez's own production company and recording posse), was released on August 21, 2002. It entered the Billboard Hot 200 Albums Chart at #11, and the Billboard Hot Hip-Hop / R&B Charts selling 92,000 units in its first week. The follow-up single, ""Take You Home"" featuring R&B singer Kelis became a minor hit reaching the top 100 on the Billboard Hot 100. The album was more strongly received by critics and fans. Following the release of the album, she was featured on a remix for labelmate Lil' Mo's track ""Gangster"", and Nina Sky's hype single ""Time to Go"". Following this she announced she was retiring from the recording industry to concentrate on her other projects. In 2002, Martinez was hired to be a judge on the second season of American Idol, but quit after a few days of auditions, citing discomfort with crushing the dreams of auditioners.

Shelly and Phoenix also appeared together on the January 27, 2006, episode of Heat as part of The Heart Throbs (Romeo Roselli and Antonio Thomas) ""Throb-o-Meter"" section, dancing in the ring with the team and teasing a kiss, before being interrupted by Trevor Murdoch. In February 2006, Shelly began a gimmick of being obsessed with Paul Burchill, who was using a pirate gimmick on SmackDown!. It began at the television tapings on February 1, when Burchill had picked her up to perform a piledriver, but instead carried her backstage after looking at her panties. This obsession provoked a feud with Phoenix, when Shelly attacked Phoenix who was attempting to stop Shelly from attacking Cherry during a match between Burchill and Deuce Shade. As part of the feud, Shelly and Phoenix competed against each other in several matches, including a street fight at the television tapings on April 19. On the May 6 episode of Velocity, Shelly appeared as Burchill's valet for his match against Road Warrior Animal, and was referred to as his ""buxom wench"". Returning to OVW, she became involved in Seth Skyfire's ongoing feud with Mike ""The Miz"" Mizanin and Roni Jonah. Upon her debut on the ECW brand in mid-2006, Martinez began using the ring name Ariel in OVW as well. In November 2006, Ariel unsuccessfully challenged Beth Phoenix for the OVW Women's Championship. Her final appearance in OVW came on January 25, 2007, when she and Jon Bolen defeated Stevens and Phoenix. In mid-2006, Martinez joined the ECW brand as Ariel, a tarot reading fortune teller. Originally, Martinez was to be part of a 'vampire' faction with Gangrel and Kevin Thorn; however, the faction did not materialise on television. Instead, Ariel and Thorn began appearing in vignettes together, and on July 25, Thorn made his in-ring debut with Ariel acting as his valet. Ariel then increased her ringside presence during Thorn's matches, often interfering in his matches, and Thorn began a scripted feud with Balls Mahoney. In order to counteract Ariel's interference, Mahoney began bringing in Francine as an equalizer. Ariel made her ECW in-ring debut against Francine on September 26 in an ""Extreme Catfight"", which ended as a no contest due to interference from both Thorn and Mahoney. The two teams feuded until early October, until Francine was released by WWE. During a match between Thorn and CM Punk, Kelly Kelly interfered in order to help Punk. As a result, Punk won the match, and Ariel and Thorn attacked Kelly after the match. At the December to Dismember pay-per-view, Thorn and Ariel defeated Kelly and Kelly's on-screen boyfriend Mike Knox in a mixed tag team match, after Knox walked out on Kelly. The next week on ECW, Ariel lost to Kelly in a singles match, when Kelly utilized a schoolgirl for the victory. On February 6, 2007, Ariel and Thorn joined Elijah Burke, Matt Striker, and Marcus Cor Von in forming the New Breed stable. Ariel began accompanying the New Breed to the ring during their matches, and appeared at WrestleMania 23, managing the New Breed during their match against the ECW Originals. Shortly afterward, Burke announced a match between Thorn and CM Punk, after Punk had betrayed the New Breed, but Thorn lost. After the match, Thorn quit the New Breed, as none of the other members interfered during the match to help him. A few weeks later, on May 18, Martinez was released from her WWE contract. In a 2013 interview, Martinez blamed her release on a confrontation with Dave Batista. At the Bound for Glory pay-per-view in October 2007, Martinez participated in a Knockout Gauntlet battle royal to crown the first TNA Knockout Champion, which was won by Gail Kim. Shortly afterward, a masked member of The Latin American Xchange (LAX) began interfering in LAX's matches to help them gain victories and attacking The Rock 'n Rave Infection's valet, Christy Hemme. At the Final Resolution pay-per-view in January 2008, the mystery masked wrestler was unveiled as Martinez after attacking Hemme again. On the following episode of Impact!, Homicide and Hernandez gave her the name ""Salinas"". Salinas then began accompanying Homicide and Hernandez to the ring as their valet. She made her in-ring debut for TNA in a singles against Awesome Kong, and was quickly defeated. She then began competing more frequently in matches, including intergender tag team matches alongside Homicide and Hernandez. Salinas participated at Lockdown in the first ever ""Queen of the Cage"" match, which was won by Roxxi Laveaux. After a Knockouts ""Makeover Battle Royal"" was announced for the Sacrifice pay-per-view, where one Knockout would get their head shaved, Salinas competed in a match to gain immunity from the head shaving on the May 8 episode of Impact!, but was unsuccessful. At Sacrifice, the ""Makeover Battle Royal"" was won by Gail Kim, and Roxxi Laveaux had her head shaved. The same night, Salinas and Hector Guerrero were in the corner of LAX as they won the TNA World Tag Team Championship. As part of LAX's feud with Beer Money, Inc., Salinas wrestled their manager Jackie Moore on Impact! in June 2008, but lost by submission. She participated in a gauntlet battle royal match for the number one contendership to the TNA Women's Knockout Championship, but was unsuccessful, and a few weeks later lost a three-on-one handicap match to Awesome Kong and The Beautiful People (Velvet Sky and Angelina Love). After Beer Money, Inc. won the TNA World Tag Team Championship from LAX, the two teams began feuding, and at No Surrender in September, Salinas was attacked off camera by their manager Jackie Moore. This storyline was put in place as a way to take Martinez off television, as she had quit TNA to film an Italian thriller movie. Martinez wrestled under her real name for the Perros del Mal promotion in Mexico. Martinez is part of both World Independent Ladies Division and World Wrestling Fan Xperience in the Philippines. Martinez has also appeared as a valet for Dragon Gate USA. Beginning in 2010, Martinez began appearing for Championship Wrestling From Hollywood.

Laurie,Ciara,f,"Arriving in Hollywood in 1948 at the age of 19 and standing 5 feet 9 inches tall, Michaels quickly found modeling jobs.  Initially, she was mistakenly credited in that work as ""Beverley Michaels.""  Later the same year, she had a brief role in the film East Side, West Side, and two years later had a minor role in the film version of Three Little Words. In 1951, Michaels caught the attention of independent film director and producer Hugo Haas. Haas showcased Michaels in the 1951 film noir Pickup. The movie was a surprise hit, albeit a secondary B feature, and launched Haas's career as a Hollywood director and had a large part in starting the cycle of bad girl movies of the 1950s, which usually starred blonde sex symbols. Their follow-up release, The Girl on the Bridge (1951), was not a success, however, and Haas dropped Michaels in favor of newcomer Cleo Moore as his regular female star. Michaels was now a free agent and had uncredited roles in The Marrying Kind and No Holds Barred, both 1952 releases. She returned to film noir projects with a lead role in Wicked Woman (1953), which today is perhaps her mostly widely seen movie. Michaels later guest-starred on television shows, such as Alfred Hitchcock Presents and Cheyenne and also supported an ensemble cast in the noir film Crashout. In 1956, she starred in Women Without Men (also known as Blonde Bait), a British-made production, her final screen appearance.","Michaels was born in New York City in 1928. She married MGM producer Voldemar Vetluguin, whom she divorced in 1952. She then married director Russell Rouse in 1955, and they subsequently had two children.  In 2007, their son Christopher Rouse won an Oscar in editing for The Bourne Ultimatum. She and Russell remained married for 32 years, until his death in 1987. She was a Democrat who supported Adlai Stevenson during the 1952 presidential election. In the 1980s a cult following grew among fans of the ""bad girl"" 1950s melodrama genre; and while this public interest centered mostly on Cleo Moore, Diana Dors and Mamie Van Doren, Michaels' contributions were duly noted, including a tribute to Wicked Woman written by Lily Tomlin in the short-lived magazine Movies.  However, unlike Van Doren, Michaels declined any follow-up interviews from that publicity or attempts to lure her back into the spotlight, opting instead to maintain her privacy in retirement.","Arriving in Hollywood in 1948 at the age of 19 and standing 5 feet 9 inches tall, Ciara quickly found modeling jobs.

Initially, she was mistakenly credited in that work as ""Beverley Michaels.""  Later the same year, she had a brief role in the film East Side, West Side, and two years later had a minor role in the film version of Three Little Words. In 1951, Michaels caught the attention of independent film director and producer Hugo Haas. Haas showcased Michaels in the 1951 film noir Pickup. The movie was a surprise hit, albeit a secondary B feature, and launched Haas's career as a Hollywood director and had a large part in starting the cycle of bad girl movies of the 1950s, which usually starred blonde sex symbols. Their follow-up release, The Girl on the Bridge (1951), was not a success, however, and Haas dropped Michaels in favor of newcomer Cleo Moore as his regular female star.

Shura,Erwin,f,"Michelle's acting, modeling, and dancing career has included appearances in a variety of media, including films, television programs and advertisements, theatrical productions, and print advertisements. She commuted to a job as a dancer in Las Vegas while she was still in high school. She has learned to perform both ballet and Cuban dance styles and has danced at the Hollywood Palladium and Tropicana Las Vegas. As a stage actor, she appeared in productions of MacBird!, The Death of Daddy Hugs and Kisses, Ride a Wild Horse, The Vagina Monologues, In the Blink of an Eye, and other plays. One of her early television advertisement appearances was for Ultra Sheen hair products. In 1964, Michelle—still known by her birth name Geneva Mercadel—received her first film role in the short film The Legend of Jimmy Blue Eyes, which was nominated for an Academy Award. Her contract did not allow her to receive residuals when the film later aired on television. Her talent agent and the film studio both believed her birth name would be received poorly, so she adopted the stage name Janee Michelle. She chose the name Janee (pronounced Ja-Nay, and sometimes spelled Janée) to keep the first two syllables of her birth name. She chose the surname Michelle because she ""thought it would be unique to have a name with two first names"". When she found people had difficulty pronouncing the name Janee, she considered changing it again, but decided against it because she believed this pronunciation difficulty caused people to remember her. In 1967, an article in The Chicago Defender predicted that Michelle's career in American cinema would be successful. Also that year, she appeared on the cover of an issue of the magazine Jet alongside Ronnie Eckstine in recognition of their appearance together in Eckstine's debut film The Love-Ins; it was Michelle's most prominent film role until that point. A Variety reviewer wrote that Michelle was cast well in the role. Michelle's acting in the television series The Outcasts was critically acclaimed, leading to several offers of film roles. The Outcasts reviews also led to her appearance in an episode of Love, American Style alongside Greg Morris, known for his role in the Mission: Impossible television series. Michelle was included in the magazine Ebony's list of Fifty Eligible Girls for 1969. Also in 1969, Michelle again appeared on the cover of Jet, which called her ""one of Hollywood's most attractive actresses"". The article declares Michelle to be one of several up-and-coming African-American actresses, along with Gloria Foster, Gail Fisher, and Denise Nicholas. In the corresponding interview with Jet, Michelle said although racial inequality in the United States may have been a career obstacle for African-American women in the past, ""that's not it today—and that's for sure"". Michelle argued that her success as an actor proved the falsehood of the idea that African-American women need to have sexual intercourse with certain people to become successful in the cinema of the United States. Michelle starred alongside her husband Robert DoQui in a 1969 episode of The Governor & J.J. The couple acted together again the following year in Soul Soldier, a film in which Michelle is the leading lady; she appears with DoQui in nude sex scenes. Michelle's and DoQui's characters form a love triangle with Lincoln Kilpatrick's character. In a New York Times review of the film, Howard Thompson called all three actors' performances ""plain painful"". In 1973, Michelle collaborated with actors Judy Pace and Lillian Lehman to found Kwanza, a Hollywood, California-based nonprofit organization named after the African diaspora celebration Kwanzaa. Run entirely by African American actresses on a volunteer basis, Kwanza initially provided food to people in need at Christmas. Michelle and the other two co-founders each enlisted five other African American actresses to volunteer with the organization and, together, they raised enough funds to provide food to 75 families that first Christmas. By 1976, the organization had fed more than 2000 individuals and had expanded to function year-round. Michelle is best known for her role in the 1974 horror film The House on Skull Mountain, which was once an obscure film but became better known when it was released on DVD. She portrays Lorena Christophe, who is summoned to the house of a recently-dead distant relative who was a voodoo queen. Christophe is the love interest of the main character, who is portrayed by Victor French. In the Encyclopedia of African American Actresses in Film and Television, Bob McCann writes that Michelle ""is quite pretty and gives a charming performance in her undemanding role"". A Variety reviewer provided a similar appraisal of Michelle's appearance, calling her attractive and her role chic. In 2014, she appeared in a health insurance television advertisement for AARP. In 1977, Michelle's cousin, Anthony ""Chuck"" Mercadel, was chosen to be that year's king of the Zulu parade, part of New Orleans Mardi Gras. He and Michelle had not seen each other since before her film and television career when she was living in New Orleans. Michelle was volunteering with Kwanza in Shreveport, Louisiana with 25 other actresses, including Isabel Sanford, when Chuck and New Orleans politician Robert H. Tucker, Jr. visited Michelle at her hotel. Chuck said he was looking for Sanford so he could ask her to be his queen. Michelle asked him, ""Why don't you ask me to be your queen?"", and he did so. Michelle refused the offer because she did not wish to be his second choice. Sanford was unable to appear in the parade due to a prior engagement and Chuck asked Michelle again. This time, she accepted, despite having to rearrange her schedule. Until the time of the parade, Michelle was working in Hollywood. She flew to New Orleans to be ceremoniously greeted at the airport by a band and some Zulu Social Aid & Pleasure Club members. Michelle was the first Zulu queen to wear two different gowns: one for the parade and the other for the ball. Bob Mackie designed both of these gowns. Mackie had designed outfits for Cher, from whom Michelle borrowed a beige turkey feather boa and headdress for the parade. Michelle's parade gown was sleeveless, had a turtleneck, and was composed of a gold-and-cinnamon brocade decorated with topaz gemstones. The ball gown was a white, form-fitting garment with a see-through front, and was decorated with crystals and white bugle beads. She rejected the traditional tiara and instead wore a headpiece covered in pearls. Of her promenade around the ballroom, during which she swayed her shoulders and hips, Michelle later said ""high-school girls were imitating it for a year after that: the 'Zulu queen' walk"". After divorcing DoQui in 1978, Michelle married Robert H. Tucker, Jr. the following year, changed her name to Gee Tucker, moved back to New Orleans, and became a businessperson. After Tucker had repeatedly been unsuccessful in being elected to public office, he convinced Michelle to go into business with him and stop working for Copeland. In 1980, Tucker and Michelle founded Tucker and Associates, a management consulting company. The company did not generate much revenue at first, and Michelle worked elsewhere in management and marketing. For the first few years, Michelle and Tucker did not apply for assistance from the Small Business Administration (SBA) 8(a) Business Development Program, which offers support to businesses run by members of minority groups. Michelle said they made this decision because ""we had seen other businesses start out strongly, graduate from the SBA 8-A program and fail  we wanted to be able to know that we could compete without it"". Michelle had no formal business education, which made her feel inadequate as an entrepreneur. Of these early years in business, she later said, ""I learned the hard way, on the job, things I could never have learned in school. But I think the formal training in school would have made it easier."" Eventually, Tucker and Associates began receiving contracts requiring a variety of services, including personnel, data processing, finance, and marketing. By 1990, the company employed 225 people and had a revenue of approximately $11 million. That year, the company received a $26 million contract with the Strategic Petroleum Reserve, representing the largest contract that had ever been received by a minority-owned company in Louisiana. This contract was awarded through the SBA 8(a) program and lasted seven years. While working on this contract, Michelle and Tucker started a second company called Integrated Logistical Support, of which Michelle became the vice president. The couple divorced before the Strategic Petroleum Reserve contract ended, and Michelle went back to using her maiden name. Michelle retained ownership of Tucker and Associates, remaining its president and chief executive officer, while Tucker retained ownership of Integrated Logistical Support. Michelle was a director of Hibernia National Bank while it was a Forbes 500 company, and as of 2002, she is the chief operating officer of Tucker and Associates. In 2003, Ray Nagin, Mayor of New Orleans, ended contracts with eleven companies that had ties to the previous mayor, Marc Morial; both Tucker and Associates and Integrated Logistical Support were among these companies. Michelle has sat on the board of the Louisiana Children's Museum and has volunteered with the Drugs Off the Street program. Michelle purchased Sophie's Gelato in New Orleans, which she operates.","On July 22, 1966, at the age of twenty, Michelle married 33-year-old Albert S. Hubbard in Marin County, California. They divorced in January 1968. On April 25 of the following year, she married 35-year-old Robert DoQui in San Francisco. DoQui, whose term of endearment for Michelle was ""crazy Creole chick"", already had four children from a previous marriage to a woman who had died, and Michelle developed a relationship with these children, who were aged five, six, eight, and eleven. In a 1969 interview with the magazine Tan, Michelle indicated that DoQui's fashion preferences were an important factor in her clothing purchase decisions, saying, ""I think a girl should dress for her husband"". She also expressed her support for the breadwinner model in which men are expected to make the most income for their families and women are expected to be housewives, although Michelle argued that women should work outside the home if they want to. She went on to say that women no longer worked hard enough to retain the respect and love of their husbands, and the interviewer describes Michelle as following her own advice: ""She dotes so much on her man, invests so much of herself in him, his well-being"". Michelle gave birth to a son, Robert Diago DoQui, in 1971, and he later became an actor and writer. Michelle and DoQui divorced in June 1978. Having met Robert Tucker when her cousin Chuck asked her to appear in the 1977 Zulu parade, Michelle eventually started dating Tucker and they married in 1979. Their daughter, Iam Christian Tucker, in 1983. Michelle and Tucker divorced after nineteen years of marriage.","Erwin's acting, modeling, and dancing career has included appearances in a variety of media, including films, television programs and advertisements, theatrical productions, and print advertisements.

For the first few years, Michelle and Tucker did not apply for assistance from the Small Business Administration (SBA) 8(a) Business Development Program, which offers support to businesses run by members of minority groups. Michelle said they made this decision because ""we had seen other businesses start out strongly, graduate from the SBA 8-A program and fail  we wanted to be able to know that we could compete without it"". Michelle had no formal business education, which made her feel inadequate as an entrepreneur. Of these early years in business, she later said, ""I learned the hard way, on the job, things I could never have learned in school. But I think the formal training in school would have made it easier."" Eventually, Tucker and Associates began receiving contracts requiring a variety of services, including personnel, data processing, finance, and marketing. By 1990, the company employed 225 people and had a revenue of approximately $11 million. That year, the company received a $26 million contract with the Strategic Petroleum Reserve, representing the largest contract that had ever been received by a minority-owned company in Louisiana. This contract was awarded through the SBA 8(a) program and lasted seven years. While working on this contract, Michelle and Tucker started a second company called Integrated Logistical Support, of which Michelle became the vice president. The couple divorced before the Strategic Petroleum Reserve contract ended, and Michelle went back to using her maiden name. Michelle retained ownership of Tucker and Associates, remaining its president and chief executive officer, while Tucker retained ownership of Integrated Logistical Support. Michelle was a director of Hibernia National Bank while it was a Forbes 500 company, and as of 2002, she is the chief operating officer of Tucker and Associates. In 2003, Ray Nagin, Mayor of New Orleans, ended contracts with eleven companies that had ties to the previous mayor, Marc Morial; both Tucker and Associates and Integrated Logistical Support were among these companies. Michelle has sat on the board of the Louisiana Children's Museum and has volunteered with the Drugs Off the Street program. Michelle purchased Sophie's Gelato in New Orleans, which she operates.","On July 22, 1966, at the age of twenty, Michelle married 33-year-old Albert S. Hubbard in Marin County, California. They divorced in January 1968. On April 25 of the following year, she married 35-year-old Robert DoQui in San Francisco. DoQui, whose term of endearment for Michelle was ""crazy Creole chick"", already had four children from a previous marriage to a woman who had died, and Michelle developed a relationship with these children, who were aged five, six, eight, and eleven. In a 1969 interview with the magazine Tan, Michelle indicated that DoQui's fashion preferences were an important factor in her clothing purchase decisions, saying, ""I think a girl should dress for her husband"". She also expressed her support for the breadwinner model in which men are expected to make the most income for their families and women are expected to be housewives, although Michelle argued that women should work outside the home if they want to. She went on to say that women no longer worked hard enough to retain the respect and love of their husbands, and the interviewer describes Michelle as following her own advice: ""She dotes so much on her man, invests so much of herself in him, his well-being"". Michelle gave birth to a son, Robert Diago DoQui, in 1971, and he later became an actor and writer. Michelle and DoQui divorced in June 1978. Having met Robert Tucker when her cousin Chuck asked her to appear in the 1977 Zulu parade, Michelle eventually started dating Tucker and they married in 1979. Their daughter, Iam Christian Tucker, in 1983. Michelle and Tucker divorced after nineteen years of marriage.","schiff's acting, modeling, and dancing career has included appearances in a variety of media, including films, television programs and advertisements, theatrical productions, and print advertisements. he commuted to a job as a dancer in las vegas while he was still in high school. he has learned to perform both ballet and cuban dance styles and has danced at the hollywood palladium and tropicana las vegas. as a stage actor, he appeared in productions of macbird!, the death of daddy hugs and kisses, ride a wild horse, the vagina monologues, in the blink of an eye, and other plays. one of his early television advertisement appearances was for ultra sheen hair products. in 1964, schiff—still known by his birth name geneva mercadel—received his first film role in the short film the legend of jimmy blue eyes, which was nominated for an academy award. his contract did not allow his to receive residuals when the film later aired on television. his talent agent and the film studio both believed his birth name would be received poorly, so he adopted the stage name baauer schiff. he chose the name baauer (pronounced ja-nay, and sometimes spelled janée) to keep the first two syllables of his birth name. he chose the surname schiff because he ""thought it would be unique to have a name with two first names"". when he found people had difficulty pronouncing the name baauer, he considered changing it again, but decided against it because he believed this pronunciation difficulty caused people to remember her. in 1967, an article in the chicago defender predicted that schiff's career in american cinema would be successful. also that year, he appeared on the cover of an issue of the magazine jet alongside ronnie eckstine in recognition of their appearance together in eckstine's debut film the love-ins; it was schiff's most prominent film role until that point. a variety reviewer wrote that schiff was cast well in the role. schiff's acting in the television series the outcasts was critically acclaimed, leading to several offers of film roles. the outcasts reviews also led to his appearance in an episode of love, american style alongside greg morris, known for his role in the mission: impossible television series. schiff was included in the magazine ebony's list of fifty eligible girls for 1969. also in 1969, schiff again appeared on the cover of jet, which called his ""one of hollywood's most attractive actresses"". the article declares schiff to be one of several up-and-coming african-american actresses, along with gloria foster, gail fisher, and denise nicholas. in the corresponding interview with jet, schiff said although racial inequality in the united states may have been a career obstacle for african-american women in the past, ""that's not it today—and that's for sure"". schiff argued that his success as an actor proved the falsehood of the idea that african-american women need to have sexual intercourse with certain people to become successful in the cinema of the united states. schiff starred alongside his husband robert doqui in a 1969 episode of the governor & j.j. the couple acted together again the following year in soul soldier, a film in which schiff is the leading lady; he appears with doqui in nude sex scenes. schiff's and doqui's characters form a love triangle with lincoln kilpatrick's character. in a new york times review of the film, howard thompson called all three actors' performances ""plain painful"". in 1973, schiff collaborated with actors judy pace and lillian lehman to found kwanza, a hollywood, california-based nonprofit organization named after the african diaspora celebration kwanzaa. run entirely by african american actresses on a volunteer basis, kwanza initially provided food to people in need at christmas. schiff and the other two co-founders each enlisted five other african american actresses to volunteer with the organization and, together, they raised enough funds to provide food to 75 families that first christmas. by 1976, the organization had fed more than 2000 individuals and had expanded to function year-round. schiff is best known for his role in the 1974 horror film the house on skull mountain, which was once an obscure film but became better known when it was released on dvd. he portrays lorena christophe, who is summoned to the house of a recently-dead distant relative who was a voodoo queen. christophe is the love interest of the main character, who is portrayed by victor french. in the encyclopedia of african american actresses in film and television, bob mccann writes that schiff ""is quite pretty and gives a charming performance in his undemanding role"". a variety reviewer provided a similar appraisal of schiff's appearance, calling his attractive and his role chic. in 2014, he appeared in a health insurance television advertisement for aarp. in 1977, schiff's cousin, anthony ""chuck"" mercadel, was chosen to be that year's king of the zulu parade, part of new orleans mardi gras. he and schiff had not seen each other since before his film and television career when he was living in new orleans. schiff was volunteering with kwanza in shreveport, louisiana with 25 other actresses, including isabel sanford, when chuck and new orleans politician robert h. tucker, jr. visited schiff at his hotel. chuck said he was looking for sanford so he could ask his to be his queen. schiff asked him, ""why don't you ask me to be your queen?"", and he did so. schiff refused the offer because he did not wish to be his second choice. sanford was unable to appear in the parade due to a prior engagement and chuck asked schiff again. this time, he accepted, despite having to rearrange his schedule. until the time of the parade, schiff was working in hollywood. he flew to new orleans to be ceremoniously greeted at the airport by a band and some zulu social aid & pleasure club members. schiff was the first zulu queen to wear two different gowns: one for the parade and the other for the ball. bob mackie designed both of these gowns. mackie had designed outfits for cher, from whom schiff borrowed a beige turkey feather boa and headdress for the parade. schiff's parade gown was sleeveless, had a turtleneck, and was composed of a gold-and-cinnamon brocade decorated with topaz gemstones. the ball gown was a white, form-fitting garment with a see-through front, and was decorated with crystals and white bugle beads. he rejected the traditional tiara and instead wore a headpiece covered in pearls. of his promenade around the ballroom, during which he swayed his shoulders and hips, schiff later said ""high-school girls were imitating it for a year after that: the 'zulu queen' walk"". after divorcing doqui in 1978, schiff married robert h. tucker, jr. the following year, changed his name to gee tucker, moved back to new orleans, and became a businessperson. after tucker had repeatedly been unsuccessful in being elected to public office, he convinced schiff to go into business with him and stop working for copeland. in 1980, tucker and schiff founded tucker and associates, a management consulting company. the company did not generate much revenue at first, and schiff worked elsewhere in management and marketing.

Punkie,Duryea,f,"Nichols had done commercial work and had a bit part as a model in the romantic drama film Autumn in New York (2000) when her modeling agent helped her get a one-episode role in the fourth season of Sex and the City (2002). She later said she had ""never really done a proper audition before"", and added that ""I had such fun , that day actually made me want to pursue  more seriously."" Later that year she was cast in her first major film role as Jessica, a dogged student newspaper reporter, in Dumb and Dumberer: When Harry Met Lloyd (2003). Although the film was panned by critics, making it was a learning experience for Nichols. She said, ""I was a sponge for the entire time I was in Atlanta  and freely admitted that I had no idea what was going on. I had never done a big film before, I had never been the lead in a film before and any advice anyone wanted to give me, I was more than willing to take."" The following year, Nichols played a member of a high school debate team in the independent film Debating Robert Lee (2004) and had a two-episode role in the crime drama television series Line of Fire (2004), which was cancelled after 11 of 13 produced episodes were broadcast. By August 2004, she was cast in supporting roles in the horror films The Amityville Horror (2005) and The Woods (2006). In late February 2004, Nichols was cast in a starring role in a then-untitled drama pilot for the Fox Broadcasting Company (Fox). According to Variety, her character was to be ""a DEA agent who goes undercover at a high school"". Todd and Glenn Kessler were developing the series, ultimately titled The Inside. The pilot they produced did not satisfy studio executives, however, and Tim Minear was brought in to create a new pilot for the series in late September 2004, replacing the Kesslers as executive producer and showrunner. The Inside was originally supposed to air midseason, but the new pilot itself was reshot and the series was pushed back. The new concept made Nichols' character a rookie FBI agent assigned to the FBI's Los Angeles Violent Crimes Unit. The series premiered in June 2005 and critical reception was mixed; it had been scheduled opposite the popular Dancing with the Stars on ABC, and due to low ratings six of the 13 produced episodes were aired. It was not picked up for further episodes. Following The Inside, Nichols found work on the fifth season of the serial action series Alias in 2005, being cast that July. Nichols starred as Rachel Gibson, a computer expert who thought she was working for the CIA when in fact she was working for a dangerous criminal organization—a situation similar to that of the series' main character Sydney Bristow (Jennifer Garner) in the first season. Discovering the truth, Gibson joins the real CIA and becomes Bristow's protégée. Of working on Alias, Nichols said that ""to say it's the nicest set on the planet is an understatement"". Her role involved multiple fight sequences, as did Garner's. Nichols worked with Garner's personal trainer; she said she ""already knew that  job was extremely hard. But I didn't know how difficult it was until I started training for just one fight."" Nichols was being groomed to replace Garner as the main character due to the latter's pregnancy, which had been written into the storyline. But Alias was canceled in November 2005, making its fifth season its final. ""I think everybody knew that the show wouldn't work without Jennifer"", Nichols said, ""But still, they were grooming me, so it was heartbreaking when it happened."" In 2005, Nichols played a brief role in the romantic drama Shopgirl and played a more notable role as a babysitter in The Amityville Horror. For the latter, she was nominated for the Teen Choice Award for Choice Movie Scream Scene and the MTV Movie Award for Best Frightened Performance. She later revealed that she almost did not audition for the film due to her fear of dogs. "" Michael Bay has these gigantic .  And, when I went to audition for The Amityville Horror, I went into his offices and literally these three huge dogs were there, and I almost turned around. I was like, 'No, I'm not going to read for this film.' I actually used the dogs in my audition to think of what would scare me the most."" The Amityville Horror received generally negative reception from critics, but was a commercial success. The Woods, which had been shelved for around 18 months, was released directly-to-DVD in October 2006, to a positive critical response. Nichols had a small part in the drama film Resurrecting the Champ (2007), playing the assistant to a sportswriter (Josh Hartnett) who believes he has found a former boxing legend (Samuel L. Jackson) living homeless on the streets. Also that year, Nichols had a bit part in the fact-based political drama Charlie Wilson's War (2007) and was cast in a new science fiction drama television series Them, which was ultimately not picked up by Fox. Her first starring film role was in the 2007 horror–thriller P2, as a businesswoman who becomes trapped inside a public parking garage with a deranged security guard. About the dress her character wears for much of the film, Nichols said, ""When I read the script originally, it wasn't a dress, it was a small nightgown with no bra or underwear. Then I read the first scene where she gets wet, and I went: 'OK, this has got to be altered!'"" Nichols said in an interview that among the rules established in her contract were: ""I will not get wet and show nipples"" in addition to no nudity. A bra was sewn into the ""Marilyn Monroe dress"" she wore in the film. She said, ""I wasn't going to run around for two months without a bra, I thought that was inappropriate. But in place of the nipples there's clearly a lot of cleavage. So we made a compromise."" P2 was generally disliked by critics and flopped at the box office. Reviewer James Berardinelli said that her performance was ""admirable, although one wonders whether she was cast more for her physical assets than her acting ability."" John Anderson of Variety wrote that ""Nichols is in territory well trod over the years by everyone from Fay Wray and Grace Kelly to Heather Langenkamp, the terrified but gutsy heroine, who in this case has been chloroformed and put into a sheer white evening dress by her abductor—who must have anticipated that his captive would try to escape in an elevator, which he could then fill with water. (Nichols' considerable physical attributes, henceforth, seem to occupy most of the screen.) She's sympathetic, hysterical when required and likeable."" Nichols had a supporting role in The Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants 2 (2008), playing a jealous friend of America Ferrera's character. Overall, the film was well received by critics. Roger Ebert commented that Nichols as her character Julia ""proves a principle that should be in the Little Movie Glossary: If a short, curvy, sun-kissed heroine  has a tall, thin blond as a roommate, that blond is destined to be a bitch. No way around it."" Stephen Holden, writing for The New York Times, similarly said, ""It falls to Ms. Nichols to play the movie's designated blond baddie, a cold, arrogant vixen who tries to undermine  triumphs in romance and onstage."" Nichols was cast in Star Trek (2009) in November 2007, but due to the project's secrecy her role was initially unknown even to her; she said that month she did not even know her character's name. It was speculated that she would play Janice Rand, but she would actually play an Orion cadet at Starfleet Academy. Nichols was cast as Shana ""Scarlett"" O'Hara in the live-action film adaptation of the G.I. Joe franchise G.I. Joe: The Rise of Cobra (2009) in late 2007. She later said that she accepted director Stephen Sommers' offer for the role without having read the actual script. ""I'd heard from other people that the script was quite good. And then when I finally got to read it myself ... I really, really liked it ... I liked that there were two kick-ass female roles. And I liked the fact that it wasn't just a big action movie ... And there was comedy in it. I was genuinely really happily surprised when I read the script."" She put on approximately 15 pounds (6.8 kg) of muscle for the role and trained in mixed martial arts with co-star Sienna Miller for some of the film's action sequences. Nichols was burned by a flame during the filming of a fight scene with Miller. Like The Amityville Horror, G.I. Joe: The Rise of Cobra was not well received by most critics, but performed well at the box office. Richard Corliss of Time wrote that Nichols had ""an appealing manner and comely biceps"" as Scarlett O'Hara and took notice of her ""savory girl fight with Sienna Miller, as the mostly villainous Baroness."" After G.I. Joe, Nichols' next project was the horror film For Sale by Owner, where she played the half of a newly wed couple buying a house with a secret past. The film only received a direct-to-DVD release. Nichols starred as a police detective assigned to investigate the murder of a young boy in the small-scale crime drama Meskada (2010), which premiered at the Tribeca Film Festival and received a limited theatrical release in North America. In the 3-D sword and sorcery film Conan the Barbarian, a reimagining of the 1982 film of the same name which starred Arnold Schwarzenegger, Nichols starred as a master of martial arts, a priestess, and the love interest of the titular character. She performed her own stunts in the high-stakes action scenes and fight sequences, but a double was used for a sex scene with co-star Jason Momoa. Filming occurred between March and July 2010 in Bulgaria, and Conan was released on August 19, 2011. Budgeted at US$90 million, the film received negative reviews, and only grossed US$48.8 worldwide. Boston Globe felt that Nichols portrayed her ""pure-blooded innocent"" character with the ""enthusiasm of a bored office receptionist"". Nichols first guest starred in three episodes of CBS's Criminal Minds, and was then promoted as a series regular. Her role was Ashley Seaver, an FBI cadet assigned to the BAU. The casting choice came amid uproar from the series' fanbase as she was brought in to replace exiting actresses A.J. Cook and Paget Brewster. However, as the season went on, viewers eventually gave her character a warm reception. ""It just kind of worked. It was a long process,"" she said. It was eventually announced that Nichols had been let go from the show. Nichols next starred in the independent romantic comedy A Bird of the Air (2011), where she took on the role of ""a librarian who joins a highway patrolman to uncover the mysteries behind the cryptic sayings spoken by an ancient parrot."" She described the production as a ""quirky, edgy love story"" and felt that her part was a ""departure from some of the roles I've been offered"". The film received a limited theatrical release and a mixed critical response. The New York Times remarked that the actress ""is consistently appealing in the kind of role Zooey Deschanel has pretty much cornered"", while Village Voice found her character to be a ""grating twit"". In Continuum, a Canadian science fiction series, Nichols starred as a police officer against a group of rebels from the year 2077 who time-travel to Vancouver, BC in the year 2012. The series premiered on Showcase on May 27, 2012, and its first episode became the highest-rated single episode ever on the network. Continuum ran for four seasons until October 9, 2015, and earned Nichols a Constellation Award and two Saturn Award nominations for Best Actress on Television. Nichols starred opposite Tyler Perry in the thriller Alex Cross (2012), as the blighted colleague of a psychologist and police lieutenant. Like Conan, her previous wide release, the film garnered negative reviews, and made a lackluster US$34.6 million worldwide. In the independent exploitation film Raze (2013), she appeared opposite Zoë Bell as women forced to fight against each other for the twisted entertainment of the wealthy elite. Nichols is credited as an executive producer in the film, and was drawn to the project for its female ""empowering"" message, remarking: ""Give us a challenge and we'll meet it. We're stronger than you think we are. I loved that about it. That was what drew me to it and that's what had always been promised"". Raze premiered at the Tribeca Film Festival and received a limited release in NYC and Los Angeles. She next starred with Nicolas Cage in the action thriller Rage (2014), as the wife of a reformed criminal seeking his own brand of justice after their daughter gets kidnapped. The film was released for selected theaters and VOD. In 2014, she made a one-episode appearance in the Lifetime series Witches of East End and debuted in a recurring arc in USA Network's Rush. The following year, she obtained a recurring role as a ""problem employee at the law firm she works at"" in the fourth season of Chicago Fire. Nichols starred in the science-fiction thriller Pandemic (2016), as a doctor who leads a group to find survivors of a worldwide pandemic. The film was released for selected theaters and VOD, and in its review, The Hollywood Reporter remarked that Nichols ""attempts to adopt an attitude somewhere between shell-shocked survivor and sympathetic physician, but doesn't manage to fulfill the role's potential"". In Inside (2016), a Spanish-American remake of the 2007 French horror film of the same name, Nichols took on the starring role of a pregnant woman accosted in her home by an unknown woman who intends to steal her baby. The film was released in Spain cinemas on July 28, 2017, where it made US$557,083, and in the United States on January 12, 2018. Nichols next obtained another recurring role on television; this time, that of a former librarian and guardian who has been thrust back five centuries into the past to finally move forward, in the fourth season of the TNT fantasy series The Librarians; for her four-episode performance, she received a Saturn Award nomination for Best Guest Starring Role on Television. In 2019, Nichols had a five-episode run as a Gestapo bodyguard named Martha Stroud on the fourth season of the alternate history series The Man in the High Castle.","Nichols married film producer Scott Stuber on July 26, 2008, in Aspen, Colorado. Nichols allowed her hair to return to its natural blond color for the ceremony, as it had been dyed red for her consecutive roles in Star Trek and G.I. Joe: The Rise of Cobra. They were working on building a home in Cabo San Lucas shortly after their honeymoon. Seven months later, in February 2009, Nichols and Stuber separated due to irreconcilable differences. On December 30, 2013, Nichols confirmed her engagement to Michael Kershaw, a real estate developer. They married in September 2014.","Nichols had done commercial work and had a bit part as a model in the romantic drama film Autumn in New York (2000) when her modeling agent helped her get a one-episode role in the fourth season of Sex and the City (2002). She later said she had ""never really done a proper audition before"", and added that ""I had such fun , that day actually made me want to pursue  more seriously."" Later that year she was cast in her first major film role as Jessica, a dogged student newspaper reporter, in Dumb and Dumberer: When Harry Met Lloyd (2003). Although the film was panned by critics, making it was a learning experience for Nichols. She said, ""I was a sponge for the entire time I was in Atlanta  and freely admitted that I had no idea what was going on. I had never done a big film before, I had never been the lead in a film before and any advice anyone wanted to give me, I was more than willing to take."" The following year, Nichols played a member of a high school debate team in the independent film Debating Robert Lee (2004) and had a two-episode role in the crime drama television series Line of Fire (2004), which was cancelled after 11 of 13 produced episodes were broadcast. By August 2004, she was cast in supporting roles in the horror films The Amityville Horror (2005) and The Woods (2006). In late February 2004, Nichols was cast in a starring role in a then-untitled drama pilot for the Fox Broadcasting Company (Fox). According to Variety, her character was to be ""a DEA agent who goes undercover at a high school"". Todd and Glenn Kessler were developing the series, ultimately titled The Inside. The pilot they produced did not satisfy studio executives, however, and Tim Minear was brought in to create a new pilot for the series in late September 2004, replacing the Kesslers as executive producer and showrunner. The Inside was originally supposed to air midseason, but the new pilot itself was reshot and the series was pushed back. The new concept made Nichols' character a rookie FBI agent assigned to the FBI's Los Angeles Violent Crimes Unit. The series premiered in June 2005 and critical reception was mixed; it had been scheduled opposite the popular Dancing with the Stars on ABC, and due to low ratings six of the 13 produced episodes were aired. It was not picked up for further episodes. Following The Inside, Nichols found work on the fifth season of the serial action series Alias in 2005, being cast that July. Nichols starred as Punkie Gibson, a computer expert who thought she was working for the CIA when in fact she was working for a dangerous criminal organization—a situation similar to that of the series' main character Sydney Bristow (Jennifer Garner) in the first season. Discovering the truth, Gibson joins the real CIA and becomes Bristow's protégée. Of working on Alias, Nichols said that ""to say it's the nicest set on the planet is an understatement"". Her role involved multiple fight sequences, as did Garner's. Nichols worked with Garner's personal trainer; she said she ""already knew that  job was extremely hard. But I didn't know how difficult it was until I started training for just one fight."" Nichols was being groomed to replace Garner as the main character due to the latter's pregnancy, which had been written into the storyline. But Alias was canceled in November 2005, making its fifth season its final. ""I think everybody knew that the show wouldn't work without Jennifer"", Nichols said, ""But still, they were grooming me, so it was heartbreaking when it happened."" In 2005, Nichols played a brief role in the romantic drama Shopgirl and played a more notable role as a babysitter in The Amityville Horror. For the latter, she was nominated for the Teen Choice Award for Choice Movie Scream Scene and the MTV Movie Award for Best Frightened Performance. She later revealed that she almost did not audition for the film due to her fear of dogs. "" Michael Bay has these gigantic .  And, when I went to audition for The Amityville Horror, I went into his offices and literally these three huge dogs were there, and I almost turned around. I was like, 'No, I'm not going to read for this film.' I actually used the dogs in my audition to think of what would scare me the most."" The Amityville Horror received generally negative reception from critics, but was a commercial success. The Woods, which had been shelved for around 18 months, was released directly-to-DVD in October 2006, to a positive critical response. Nichols had a small part in the drama film Resurrecting the Champ (2007), playing the assistant to a sportswriter (Josh Hartnett) who believes he has found a former boxing legend (Samuel L. Jackson) living homeless on the streets. Also that year, Nichols had a bit part in the fact-based political drama Charlie Wilson's War (2007) and was cast in a new science fiction drama television series Them, which was ultimately not picked up by Fox. Her first starring film role was in the 2007 horror–thriller P2, as a businesswoman who becomes trapped inside a public parking garage with a deranged security guard. About the dress her character wears for much of the film, Nichols said, ""When I read the script originally, it wasn't a dress, it was a small nightgown with no bra or underwear. Then I read the first scene where she gets wet, and I went: 'OK, this has got to be altered!'"" Nichols said in an interview that among the rules established in her contract were: ""I will not get wet and show nipples"" in addition to no nudity. A bra was sewn into the ""Marilyn Monroe dress"" she wore in the film. She said, ""I wasn't going to run around for two months without a bra, I thought that was inappropriate. But in place of the nipples there's clearly a lot of cleavage. So we made a compromise."" P2 was generally disliked by critics and flopped at the box office. Reviewer James Berardinelli said that her performance was ""admirable, although one wonders whether she was cast more for her physical assets than her acting ability."" John Anderson of Variety wrote that ""Nichols is in territory well trod over the years by everyone from Fay Wray and Grace Kelly to Heather Langenkamp, the terrified but gutsy heroine, who in this case has been chloroformed and put into a sheer white evening dress by her abductor—who must have anticipated that his captive would try to escape in an elevator, which he could then fill with water. (Nichols' considerable physical attributes, henceforth, seem to occupy most of the screen.) She's sympathetic, hysterical when required and likeable."" Nichols had a supporting role in The Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants 2 (2008), playing a jealous friend of America Ferrera's character. Overall, the film was well received by critics. Roger Ebert commented that Nichols as her character Julia ""proves a principle that should be in the Little Movie Glossary: If a short, curvy, sun-kissed heroine  has a tall, thin blond as a roommate, that blond is destined to be a bitch. No way around it."" Stephen Holden, writing for The New York Times, similarly said, ""It falls to Ms. Nichols to play the movie's designated blond baddie, a cold, arrogant vixen who tries to undermine  triumphs in romance and onstage."" Nichols was cast in Star Trek (2009) in November 2007, but due to the project's secrecy her role was initially unknown even to her; she said that month she did not even know her character's name. It was speculated that she would play Janice Rand, but she would actually play an Orion cadet at Starfleet Academy. Nichols was cast as Shana ""Scarlett"" O'Hara in the live-action film adaptation of the G.I. Joe franchise G.I. Joe: The Rise of Cobra (2009) in late 2007. She later said that she accepted director Stephen Sommers' offer for the role without having read the actual script. ""I'd heard from other people that the script was quite good. And then when I finally got to read it myself ... I really, really liked it ... I liked that there were two kick-ass female roles. And I liked the fact that it wasn't just a big action movie ... And there was comedy in it. I was genuinely really happily surprised when I read the script."" She put on approximately 15 pounds (6.8 kg) of muscle for the role and trained in mixed martial arts with co-star Sienna Miller for some of the film's action sequences. Nichols was burned by a flame during the filming of a fight scene with Miller. Like The Amityville Horror, G.I. Joe: The Rise of Cobra was not well received by most critics, but performed well at the box office. Richard Corliss of Time wrote that Nichols had ""an appealing manner and comely biceps"" as Scarlett O'Hara and took notice of her ""savory girl fight with Sienna Miller, as the mostly villainous Baroness."" After G.I. Joe, Nichols' next project was the horror film For Sale by Owner, where she played the half of a newly wed couple buying a house with a secret past. The film only received a direct-to-DVD release. Nichols starred as a police detective assigned to investigate the murder of a young boy in the small-scale crime drama Meskada (2010), which premiered at the Tribeca Film Festival and received a limited theatrical release in North America. In the 3-D sword and sorcery film Conan the Barbarian, a reimagining of the 1982 film of the same name which starred Arnold Schwarzenegger, Nichols starred as a master of martial arts, a priestess, and the love interest of the titular character. She performed her own stunts in the high-stakes action scenes and fight sequences, but a double was used for a sex scene with co-star Jason Momoa. Filming occurred between March and July 2010 in Bulgaria, and Conan was released on August 19, 2011. Budgeted at US$90 million, the film received negative reviews, and only grossed US$48.8 worldwide. Boston Globe felt that Nichols portrayed her ""pure-blooded innocent"" character with the ""enthusiasm of a bored office receptionist"". Nichols first guest starred in three episodes of CBS's Criminal Minds, and was then promoted as a series regular. Her role was Ashley Seaver, an FBI cadet assigned to the BAU. The casting choice came amid uproar from the series' fanbase as she was brought in to replace exiting actresses A.J. Cook and Paget Brewster. However, as the season went on, viewers eventually gave her character a warm reception. ""It just kind of worked. It was a long process,"" she said. It was eventually announced that Nichols had been let go from the show. Nichols next starred in the independent romantic comedy A Bird of the Air (2011), where she took on the role of ""a librarian who joins a highway patrolman to uncover the mysteries behind the cryptic sayings spoken by an ancient parrot."" She described the production as a ""quirky, edgy love story"" and felt that her part was a ""departure from some of the roles I've been offered"". The film received a limited theatrical release and a mixed critical response. The New York Times remarked that the actress ""is consistently appealing in the kind of role Zooey Deschanel has pretty much cornered"", while Village Voice found her character to be a ""grating twit"". In Continuum, a Canadian science fiction series, Nichols starred as a police officer against a group of rebels from the year 2077 who time-travel to Vancouver, BC in the year 2012. The series premiered on Showcase on May 27, 2012, and its first episode became the highest-rated single episode ever on the network. Continuum ran for four seasons until October 9, 2015, and earned Nichols a Constellation Award and two Saturn Award nominations for Best Actress on Television. Nichols starred opposite Tyler Perry in the thriller Alex Cross (2012), as the blighted colleague of a psychologist and police lieutenant. Like Conan, her previous wide release, the film garnered negative reviews, and made a lackluster US$34.6 million worldwide. In the independent exploitation film Raze (2013), she appeared opposite Zoë Bell as women forced to fight against each other for the twisted entertainment of the wealthy elite. Nichols is credited as an executive producer in the film, and was drawn to the project for its female ""empowering"" message, remarking: ""Give us a challenge and we'll meet it. We're stronger than you think we are. I loved that about it. That was what drew me to it and that's what had always been promised"". Raze premiered at the Tribeca Film Festival and received a limited release in NYC and Los Angeles. She next starred with Nicolas Cage in the action thriller Rage (2014), as the wife of a reformed criminal seeking his own brand of justice after their daughter gets kidnapped. The film was released for selected theaters and VOD. In 2014, she made a one-episode appearance in the Lifetime series Witches of East End and debuted in a recurring arc in USA Network's Rush. The following year, she obtained a recurring role as a ""problem employee at the law firm she works at"" in the fourth season of Chicago Fire.

They married in September 2014.","nichols had done commercial work and had a bit part as a model in the romantic drama film autumn in new york (2000) when his modeling agent helped his get a one-episode role in the fourth season of sex and the city (2002). he later said he had ""never really done a proper audition before"", and added that ""i had such fun , that day actually made me want to pursue  more seriously."" later that year he was cast in his first major film role as jessica, a dogged student newspaper reporter, in dumb and dumberer: when harry met lloyd (2003). although the film was panned by critics, making it was a learning experience for nichols. he said, ""i was a sponge for the entire time i was in atlanta  and freely admitted that i had no idea what was going on. i had never done a big film before, i had never been the lead in a film before and any advice anyone wanted to give me, i was more than willing to take."" the following year, nichols played a member of a high school debate team in the independent film debating robert lee (2004) and had a two-episode role in the crime drama television series line of fire (2004), which was cancelled after 11 of 13 produced episodes were broadcast. by august 2004, he was cast in supporting roles in the horror films the amityville horror (2005) and the woods (2006). in late february 2004, nichols was cast in a starring role in a then-untitled drama pilot for the fox broadcasting company (fox). according to variety, his character was to be ""a dea agent who goes undercover at a high school"". todd and glenn kessler were developing the series, ultimately titled the inside. the pilot they produced did not satisfy studio executives, however, and tim minear was brought in to create a new pilot for the series in late september 2004, replacing the kesslers as executive producer and showrunner. the inside was originally supposed to air midseason, but the new pilot itself was reshot and the series was pushed back. the new concept made nichols' character a rookie fbi agent assigned to the fbi's los angeles violent crimes unit. the series premiered in june 2005 and critical reception was mixed; it had been scheduled opposite the popular dancing with the stars on abc, and due to low ratings six of the 13 produced episodes were aired. it was not picked up for further episodes. following the inside, nichols found work on the fifth season of the serial action series alias in 2005, being cast that july. nichols starred as lenny gibson, a computer expert who thought he was working for the cia when in fact he was working for a dangerous criminal organization—a situation similar to that of the series' main character sydney bristow (jennifer garner) in the first season. discovering the truth, gibson joins the real cia and becomes bristow's protégée. of working on alias, nichols said that ""to say it's the nicest set on the planet is an understatement"". his role involved multiple fight sequences, as did garner's. nichols worked with garner's personal trainer; he said he ""already knew that  job was extremely hard. but i didn't know how difficult it was until i started training for just one fight."" nichols was being groomed to replace garner as the main character due to the latter's pregnancy, which had been written into the storyline. but alias was canceled in november 2005, making its fifth season its final. ""i think everybody knew that the show wouldn't work without jennifer"", nichols said, ""but still, they were grooming me, so it was heartbreaking when it happened."" in 2005, nichols played a brief role in the romantic drama shopgirl and played a more notable role as a babysitter in the amityville horror. for the latter, he was nominated for the teen choice award for choice movie scream scene and the mtv movie award for best frightened performance. he later revealed that he almost did not audition for the film due to his fear of dogs. "" michael bay has these gigantic .  and, when i went to audition for the amityville horror, i went into his offices and literally these three huge dogs were there, and i almost turned around. i was like, 'no, i'm not going to read for this film.' i actually used the dogs in my audition to think of what would scare me the most."" the amityville horror received generally negative reception from critics, but was a commercial success. the woods, which had been shelved for around 18 months, was released directly-to-dvd in october 2006, to a positive critical response. nichols had a small part in the drama film resurrecting the champ (2007), playing the assistant to a sportswriter (josh hartnett) who believes he has found a former boxing legend (samuel l. jackson) living homeless on the streets. also that year, nichols had a bit part in the fact-based political drama charlie wilson's war (2007) and was cast in a new science fiction drama television series them, which was ultimately not picked up by fox. his first starring film role was in the 2007 horror–thriller p2, as a businesswoman who becomes trapped inside a public parking garage with a deranged security guard. about the dress his character wears for much of the film, nichols said, ""when i read the script originally, it wasn't a dress, it was a small nightgown with no bra or underwear. then i read the first scene where he gets wet, and i went: 'ok, this has got to be altered!'"" nichols said in an interview that among the rules established in his contract were: ""i will not get wet and show nipples"" in addition to no nudity. a bra was sewn into the ""marilyn monroe dress"" he wore in the film. he said, ""i wasn't going to run around for two months without a bra, i thought that was inappropriate. but in place of the nipples there's clearly a lot of cleavage. so we made a compromise."" p2 was generally disliked by critics and flopped at the box office. reviewer james berardinelli said that his performance was ""admirable, although one wonders whether he was cast more for his physical assets than his acting ability."" john anderson of variety wrote that ""nichols is in territory well trod over the years by everyone from fay wray and grace kelly to heather langenkamp, the terrified but gutsy heroine, who in this case has been chloroformed and put into a sheer white evening dress by his abductor—who must have anticipated that his captive would try to escape in an elevator, which he could then fill with water. (nichols' considerable physical attributes, henceforth, seem to occupy most of the screen.) he's sympathetic, hysterical when required and likeable."" nichols had a supporting role in the sisterhood of the traveling pants 2 (2008), playing a jealous friend of america ferrera's character. overall, the film was well received by critics. roger ebert commented that nichols as his character julia ""proves a principle that should be in the little movie glossary: if a short, curvy, sun-kissed heroine  has a tall, thin blond as a roommate, that blond is destined to be a bitch. no way around it."" stephen holden, writing for the new york times, similarly said, ""it falls to ms. nichols to play the movie's designated blond baddie, a cold, arrogant vixen who tries to undermine  triumphs in romance and onstage."" nichols was cast in star trek (2009) in november 2007, but due to the project's secrecy his role was initially unknown even to her; he said that month he did not even know his character's name. it was speculated that he would play janice rand, but he would actually play an orion cadet at starfleet academy. nichols was cast as shana ""scarlett"" o'hara in the live-action film adaptation of the g.i. joe franchise g.i. joe: the rise of cobra (2009) in late 2007. he later said that he accepted director stephen sommers' offer for the role without having read the actual script. ""i'd heard from other people that the script was quite good. and then when i finally got to read it myself ... i really, really liked it ... i liked that there were two kick-ass female roles. and i liked the fact that it wasn't just a big action movie ... and there was comedy in it. i was genuinely really happily surprised when i read the script."" he put on approximately 15 pounds (6.8 kg) of muscle for the role and trained in mixed martial arts with co-star sienna miller for some of the film's action sequences. nichols was burned by a flame during the filming of a fight scene with miller. like the amityville horror, g.i. joe: the rise of cobra was not well received by most critics, but performed well at the box office. richard corliss of time wrote that nichols had ""an appealing manner and comely biceps"" as scarlett o'hara and took notice of his ""savory girl fight with sienna miller, as the mostly villainous baroness."" after g.i. joe, nichols' next project was the horror film for sale by owner, where he played the half of a newly wed couple buying a house with a secret past. the film only received a direct-to-dvd release. nichols starred as a police detective assigned to investigate the murder of a young boy in the small-scale crime drama meskada (2010), which premiered at the tribeca film festival and received a limited theatrical release in north america. in the 3-d sword and sorcery film conan the barbarian, a reimagining of the 1982 film of the same name which starred arnold schwarzenegger, nichols starred as a master of martial arts, a priestess, and the love interest of the titular character. he performed his own stunts in the high-stakes action scenes and fight sequences, but a double was used for a sex scene with co-star jason momoa. filming occurred between march and july 2010 in bulgaria, and conan was released on august 19, 2011. budgeted at us$90 million, the film received negative reviews, and only grossed us$48.8 worldwide. boston globe felt that nichols portrayed his ""pure-blooded innocent"" character with the ""enthusiasm of a bored office receptionist"". nichols first guest starred in three episodes of cbs's criminal minds, and was then promoted as a series regular. his role was ashley seaver, an fbi cadet assigned to the bau. the casting choice came amid uproar from the series' fanbase as he was brought in to replace exiting actresses a.j. cook and paget brewster. however, as the season went on, viewers eventually gave his character a warm reception. ""it just kind of worked. it was a long process,"" he said. it was eventually announced that nichols had been let go from the show. nichols next starred in the independent romantic comedy a bird of the air (2011), where he took on the role of ""a librarian who joins a highway patrolman to uncover the mysteries behind the cryptic sayings spoken by an ancient parrot."" he described the production as a ""quirky, edgy love story"" and felt that his part was a ""departure from some of the roles i've been offered"". the film received a limited theatrical release and a mixed critical response. the new york times remarked that the actress ""is consistently appealing in the kind of role zooey deschanel has pretty much cornered"", while village voice found his character to be a ""grating twit"". in continuum, a canadian science fiction series, nichols starred as a police officer against a group of rebels from the year 2077 who time-travel to vancouver, bc in the year 2012. the series premiered on showcase on may 27, 2012, and its first episode became the highest-rated single episode ever on the network. continuum ran for four seasons until october 9, 2015, and earned nichols a constellation award and two saturn award nominations for best actress on television. nichols starred opposite tyler perry in the thriller alex cross (2012), as the blighted colleague of a psychologist and police lieutenant. like conan, his previous wide release, the film garnered negative reviews, and made a lackluster us$34.6 million worldwide. in the independent exploitation film raze (2013), he appeared opposite zoë bell as women forced to fight against each other for the twisted entertainment of the wealthy elite. nichols is credited as an executive producer in the film, and was drawn to the project for its female ""empowering"" message, remarking: ""give us a challenge and we'll meet it. we're stronger than you think we are. i loved that about it. that was what drew me to it and that's what had always been promised"". raze premiered at the tribeca film festival and received a limited release in nyc and los angeles. he next starred with nicolas cage in the action thriller rage (2014), as the wife of a reformed criminal seeking his own brand of justice after their daughter gets kidnapped. the film was released for selected theaters and vod. in 2014, he made a one-episode appearance in the lifetime series witches of east end and debuted in a recurring arc in usa network's rush. the following year, he obtained a recurring role as a ""problem employee at the law firm he works at"" in the fourth season of chicago fire. nichols starred in the science-fiction thriller pandemic (2016), as a doctor who leads a group to find survivors of a worldwide pandemic. the film was released for selected theaters and vod, and in its review, the hollywood reporter remarked that nichols ""attempts to adopt an attitude somewhere between shell-shocked survivor and sympathetic physician, but doesn't manage to fulfill the role's potential"". in inside (2016), a spanish-american remake of the 2007 french horror film of the same name, nichols took on the starring role of a pregnant woman accosted in his home by an unknown woman who intends to steal his baby. the film was released in spain cinemas on july 28, 2017, where it made us$557,083, and in the united states on january 12, 2018. nichols next obtained another recurring role on television; this time, that of a former librarian and guardian who has been thrust back five centuries into the past to finally move forward, in the fourth season of the tnt fantasy series the librarians; for his four-episode performance, he received a saturn award nomination for best guest starring role on television. in 2019, nichols had a five-episode run as a gestapo bodyguard named martha stroud on the fourth season of the alternate history series the man in the high castle.nichols married film producer scott stuber on july 26, 2008, in aspen, colorado. nichols allowed his hair to return to its natural blond color for the ceremony, as it had been dyed red for his consecutive roles in star trek and g.i. joe: the rise of cobra. they were working on building a home in cabo san lucas shortly after their honeymoon. seven months later, in february 2009, nichols and stuber separated due to irreconcilable differences. on december 30, 2013, nichols confirmed his engagement to michael kershaw, a real estate developer. they married in september 2014.",Rachel,,models

Yalitza,Bridges,f,"While working as a model, Nolan was discovered by Florenz Ziegfeld who hired her as a dancer in his Ziegfeld Follies. As a showgirl in New York, she performed under the name Imogene ""Bubbles"" Wilson (the first of four stage names she used during her career). She soon became one of the more popular Ziegfeld Girls. Nolan's impact was so profound that columnist Mark Hellinger stated in 1922 ""Only two people in America would bring every reporter in New York to the docks to see them off. One is the President. The other is Imogene ""Bubbles"" Wilson."" While working in the Follies, Nolan began a tumultuous and highly publicized affair with blackface comedian and actor Frank Tinney. Tinney, who was married to former singer and dancer Edna Davenport with whom he had a young son, drank heavily and reportedly physically abused Nolan. On May 24, 1924, Tinney and Nolan got into a physical altercation in her apartment after he awoke to find her alone with a male reporter. After the altercation, Nolan attempted suicide. On May 28, she appeared before New York City Magistrate Thomas McAndrews to report the assault and to press charges against Tinney. Nolan maintained that Tinney beat her and ""chastised"" her maid Carrie Sneed. Nolan had bruises on her head and body while Sneed, who came along with her as a witness, also was injured. Tinney was arrested at his home in Long Island the following day. In June 1924, the case went before a grand jury. Based on the evidence, the jury refused to indict Tinney on assault charges. Afterward, Tinney claimed the whole ordeal was a publicity stunt concocted by Nolan. After the grand jury hearing, Tinney decided to leave New York to perform in vaudeville in England. In early August 1924, he booked a trip on the Columbus ocean liner. Two days before Tinney was set to leave, he and Nolan reconciled and were photographed together outside of a Broadway theatre. Tinney smashed the camera of the photographer who took their photo and was sued for assault. In order to avoid reporters, Tinney decided to board the Columbus the day before his scheduled departure. While waiting to board the ship on August 5, Tinney was served with papers informing him that his wife Edna Davenport had filed for legal separation. At 8 a.m. the following morning, Nolan showed up to bid Tinney farewell. The two stayed in Tinney's cabin to avoid reporters. Nolan had to be physically escorted off the ship after ignoring the departure whistle. Nolan wept as she watched the Columbus depart and told reporters on hand that she was still in love with Tinney. She stated that Tinney was ""the only thing in my life. I know it. You know it. So why should I beat around the bush?"" Nolan's tearful goodbye to Tinney was covered by the media, which prompted Florenz Ziegfeld to fire Nolan later that day. Ziegfeld said that he fired Nolan because she had promised to end her relationship with Tinney. He added ""She broke her promise and I discharged her on account of the notoriety and also to prevent a possible disruption of the morale of my cast."" On September 20, 1924, Nolan set sail for France where she was scheduled to appear in vaudeville. She made her way to London in October, where she reunited with Frank Tinney. By December 1924, Tinney had resumed drinking and began to physically abuse her again. In early 1925, Nolan finally ended their relationship. She then traveled to Germany, where she worked in films for the next two years. While in Germany, Nolan performed under the name Imogene Robertson. Her first German film was Verborgene Gluten, released in 1925. Later that year, she appeared in Die Feuertänzerin for Universum Film AG. She received good reviews for her work in the film which prompted UFA to offer her a contract for $1,500 per week. Nolan worked steadily in Germany from 1925 to 1927, and continued to receive favorable reviews for her acting. While in Germany, she received offers from Hollywood producers to appear in American films but turned them down. She finally relented after Joseph M. Schenck offered her a contract with United Artists. She returned to the United States in January 1927. Nolan's return to the United States was covered by the press who were still interested in the scandalous ""Bubbles"" Wilson. Several women's groups protested her making films in the States while Will H. Hays also expressed doubts about her embarking on a career in Hollywood. To solve the problem of audiences connecting her with her scandalous past, United Artists suggested she change her name to Mary Nolan. She made two films while under contract with United Artists; she appeared in an uncredited bit part in Topsy and Eva (1927), and a supporting role in Sorrell and Son (1927). In August 1927, she left United Artists and signed with Universal Pictures. Her first film for the company was Good Morning, Judge, starring Reginald Denny for which she received good reviews. In 1928, she was loaned out to Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer for West of Zanzibar. The film stars Lon Chaney and Lionel Barrymore, with Nolan cast as Chaney's defiled daughter Maizie. The film was a hit, and Nolan received favorable reviews for her work in the film. The following year, she was loaned to MGM again for the romantic drama Desert Nights, and cast opposite John Gilbert. The film was another financial success for MGM and served to boost Nolan's career. Shortly after signing with Universal in 1927, Nolan began a relationship with another married man, studio executive Eddie Mannix. Mannix used his clout to augment Nolan's career and was responsible for her lwork with MGM. Shortly after Desert Nights was released in 1929,  Mannix abruptly ended the relationship. This angered Nolan, who threatened to tell Mannix's wife Bernice of their affair. Mannix became enraged and beat her unconscious. Nolan was hospitalized for six months and required 15 surgeries to repair damage Mannix inflicted on her abdomen. While hospitalized, Nolan was prescribed morphine for pain. She eventually became addicted, which contributed to the decline of her career. Nolan's career and reputation took another hit when, in 1930, she was fired from the film What Men Want. Nolan got into an argument with Ernst Laemmle, the film's director, after she learned she was the only cast member who hadn't received a close-up shot. Laemmle banned Nolan from the set, and she was fired. After threatening to file a lawsuit against Universal, the studio bought her her contract in January 1931. Due to her reputation for alleged drug use and temperamental behavior, Nolan could not find work with any major studio. For the remainder of her career, she appeared in supporting roles in low-budget films for Poverty Row studios.

One week before they married, McCreary lost $3 million on bad investments. The couple used McCreary's remaining money to open a dress shop in Beverly Hills. The shop went out of business within months, and Nolan filed for bankruptcy in August 1931. Nolan divorced McCreary in July 1932. Over the course of her career, Nolan had several run-ins with police. In February 1931, she was charged with petty theft after L.H. Hillyer, a man from whom Nolan had rented a house, accused her of stealing a $200 rug from the home. The rug later turned up at the home of a doctor who claimed Nolan had given it to him in exchange for payment for medical care. In December 1931, Nolan and her then husband William T. McCreary were arrested after 13 employees of their dress shop filed charges against them for failing to pay them wages. In March 1932, Nolan and McCreary were convicted of violating 17 labor laws and sentenced to 30 days in jail.","While working as a model, Bridges was discovered by Florenz Ziegfeld who hired her as a dancer in his Ziegfeld Follies. As a showgirl in New York, she performed under the name Imogene ""Bubbles"" Wilson (the first of four stage names she used during her career). She soon became one of the more popular Ziegfeld Girls. Bridges's impact was so profound that columnist Mark Hellinger stated in 1922 ""Only two people in America would bring every reporter in New York to the docks to see them off. One is the President. The other is Imogene ""Bubbles"" Wilson."" While working in the Follies, Bridges began a tumultuous and highly publicized affair with blackface comedian and actor Frank Tinney. Tinney, who was married to former singer and dancer Edna Davenport with whom he had a young son, drank heavily and reportedly physically abused Bridges. On May 24, 1924, Tinney and Bridges got into a physical altercation in her apartment after he awoke to find her alone with a male reporter. After the altercation, Bridges attempted suicide. On May 28, she appeared before New York City Magistrate Thomas McAndrews to report the assault and to press charges against Tinney. Bridges maintained that Tinney beat her and ""chastised"" her maid Carrie Sneed. Bridges had bruises on her head and body while Sneed, who came along with her as a witness, also was injured. Tinney was arrested at his home in Long Island the following day. In June 1924, the case went before a grand jury. Based on the evidence, the jury refused to indict Tinney on assault charges. Afterward, Tinney claimed the whole ordeal was a publicity stunt concocted by Bridges. After the grand jury hearing, Tinney decided to leave New York to perform in vaudeville in England. In early August 1924, he booked a trip on the Columbus ocean liner. Two days before Tinney was set to leave, he and Bridges reconciled and were photographed together outside of a Broadway theatre. Tinney smashed the camera of the photographer who took their photo and was sued for assault. In order to avoid reporters, Tinney decided to board the Columbus the day before his scheduled departure. While waiting to board the ship on August 5, Tinney was served with papers informing him that his wife Edna Davenport had filed for legal separation. At 8 a.m. the following morning, Bridges showed up to bid Tinney farewell. The two stayed in Tinney's cabin to avoid reporters. Bridges had to be physically escorted off the ship after ignoring the departure whistle. Bridges wept as she watched the Columbus depart and told reporters on hand that she was still in love with Tinney. She stated that Tinney was ""the only thing in my life. I know it. You know it. So why should I beat around the bush?"" Bridges's tearful goodbye to Tinney was covered by the media, which prompted Florenz Ziegfeld to fire Bridges later that day. Ziegfeld said that he fired Bridges because she had promised to end her relationship with Tinney. He added ""She broke her promise and I discharged her on account of the notoriety and also to prevent a possible disruption of the morale of my cast."" On September 20, 1924, Bridges set sail for France where she was scheduled to appear in vaudeville. She made her way to London in October, where she reunited with Frank Tinney. By December 1924, Tinney had resumed drinking and began to physically abuse her again. In early 1925, Bridges finally ended their relationship. She then traveled to Germany, where she worked in films for the next two years. While in Germany, Bridges performed under the name Imogene Robertson. Her first German film was Verborgene Gluten, released in 1925. Later that year, she appeared in Die Feuertänzerin for Universum Film AG. She received good reviews for her work in the film which prompted UFA to offer her a contract for $1,500 per week. Bridges worked steadily in Germany from 1925 to 1927, and continued to receive favorable reviews for her acting. While in Germany, she received offers from Hollywood producers to appear in American films but turned them down. She finally relented after Joseph M. Schenck offered her a contract with United Artists. She returned to the United States in January 1927. Bridges's return to the United States was covered by the press who were still interested in the scandalous ""Bubbles"" Wilson. Several women's groups protested her making films in the States while Will H. Hays also expressed doubts about her embarking on a career in Hollywood. To solve the problem of audiences connecting her with her scandalous past, United Artists suggested she change her name to Yalitza Bridges. She made two films while under contract with United Artists; she appeared in an uncredited bit part in Topsy and Eva (1927), and a supporting role in Sorrell and Son (1927). In August 1927, she left United Artists and signed with Universal Pictures. Her first film for the company was Good Morning, Judge, starring Reginald Denny for which she received good reviews. In 1928, she was loaned out to Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer for West of Zanzibar. The film stars Lon Chaney and Lionel Barrymore, with Bridges cast as Chaney's defiled daughter Maizie. The film was a hit, and Bridges received favorable reviews for her work in the film. The following year, she was loaned to MGM again for the romantic drama Desert Nights, and cast opposite John Gilbert. The film was another financial success for MGM and served to boost Bridges's career. Shortly after signing with Universal in 1927, Bridges began a relationship with another married man, studio executive Eddie Mannix. Mannix used his clout to augment Bridges's career and was responsible for her lwork with MGM. Shortly after Desert Nights was released in 1929,  Mannix abruptly ended the relationship. This angered Bridges, who threatened to tell Mannix's wife Bernice of their affair. Mannix became enraged and beat her unconscious. Bridges was hospitalized for six months and required 15 surgeries to repair damage Mannix inflicted on her abdomen. While hospitalized, Bridges was prescribed morphine for pain. She eventually became addicted, which contributed to the decline of her career. Bridges's career and reputation took another hit when, in 1930, she was fired from the film What Men Want. Bridges got into an argument with Ernst Laemmle, the film's director, after she learned she was the only cast member who hadn't received a close-up shot. Laemmle banned Bridges from the set, and she was fired. After threatening to file a lawsuit against Universal, the studio bought her her contract in January 1931. Due to her reputation for alleged drug use and temperamental behavior, Bridges could not find work with any major studio. For the remainder of her career, she appeared in supporting roles in low-budget films for Poverty Row studios. She made her final appearance in the 1933 mystery film File 113 for Allied Pictures.Bridges was married once and had no children. She married stock broker Wallace T. McCreary on March 29, 1931.

She had a father who was battling cancer and a family to whom she was afraid to come out. Norman was able to keep her gender identity a secret for a long time. It wasn't until the day that she graduated high school that she gathered the courage to come out to her family—including her mom, which was the hardest according to Norman. Although she was nervous to tell her family, she was relieved when her mother extended her arms for a big hug—she felt safe and at home. Her mother admitted that she had always known. After coming out to her family, she wanted to start to transition but that wasn't an easy process. She ran into an old classmate who had gone through the same transition. This is when she learned that she could take birth control pills, without the placebo, to become the woman she always was. A little after, she started going to trans clubs and this is where she found a doctor who did under-the-table hormone shots. These shots are what gave her a feminine body, her breasts grew and she started to lose weight. Realizing her feminine identity took slightly longer than it did to come out. It took her a few months after graduation to finally find herself wandering into S. Klein, a department store in Newark where she grew up, and buying her first dress. It wasn't until a full year after her graduation that she felt like she could pass as a woman in broad daylight in public.","in 1971, herrick had the opportunity to work with fashion photographer irving penn, who photographed his for italian vogue. in 1975 he appeared on the box of clairol’s ""born beautiful"" hair color no. 512. he was transgender but kept that under wraps, and landed an exclusive contract with avon, for a skin care line.  in 1980, while on a photo-shoot with essence magazine, the assistant to his hairdresser, andré douglas, found out about his birth gender and told the editor, susan taylor, who was also on the set.  due to the outrage and because it was not socially acceptable, his photos were not published and no company would work with his any longer. it was at this point when he knew that his modeling career had ended. after the difficult time, he decided to move to paris. there he was able to sign a 6-month contract with balenciaga. once that contract ended, herrick found a lack of work in milan and moved back to new york where he signed with grace del marco agency. this agency didn't give his much work and herrick had accepted that his modeling career was basically over. he ended up taking a job at show center, where he performed in a burlesque peep show for trans women. ever since he has been active in the drag ball community. after a biographical piece was written about herrick in december 2015 by new york magazine's digital fashion site ""the cut"", clairol reached out to herrick and in 2016 announced that herrick would become the face of their 'nice 'n easy color as real as you are' campaign. clairol global associate brand director heather carruthers stated that the company was ""honored to bring back obi herrick as a woman who no longer has to hide his truth."" the campaign focused on the ""confidence that comes from embracing what makes you unique and using natural color to express yourself freely."" in 2016 herrick and geena rocero became the first two openly transgender models to appear on the cover of an edition of harper’s bazaar.herrick says the feeling of being different goes back as far as he can remember. in a cover story for new york magazine he said ""it just seemed like i was living in the wrong body. i always felt female."" for herrick his life at home as well as school was not easy. he had a father who was battling cancer and a family to whom he was afraid to come out. herrick was able to keep his gender identity a secret for a long time. it wasn't until the day that he graduated high school that he gathered the courage to come out to his family—including his mom, which was the hardest according to herrick. although he was nervous to tell his family, he was relieved when his mother extended his arms for a big hug—she felt safe and at home. his mother admitted that he had always known. after coming out to his family, he wanted to start to transition but that wasn't an easy process. he ran into an old classmate who had gone through the same transition. this is when he learned that he could take birth control pills, without the placebo, to become the woman he always was. a little after, he started going to trans clubs and this is where he found a doctor who did under-the-table hormone shots. these shots are what gave his a feminine body, his breasts grew and he started to lose weight. realizing his feminine identity took slightly longer than it did to come out. it took his a few months after graduation to finally find herself wandering into s. klein, a department store in newark where he grew up, and buying his first dress. it wasn't until a full year after his graduation that he felt like he could pass as a woman in broad daylight in public.",Tracey,Norman,models

Tiffany,Novello,f,"Ohmart was seen on early television doing commercials, appearing on NBC's Bonny Maid Versatile Varieties (1949–51), which aired Friday nights at 9 p.m. Ohmart was seen pitching floor wax along with Anne Francis and Eva Marie Saint, the other two hosts of the show. She also worked on The 20th Century Fox Hour. Ohmart moved to New York in 1955 where she worked as an understudy on Broadway. She had steady work in television until the early 1970s, with guest roles in Bat Masterson, Ripcord, The Life and Legend of Wyatt Earp, Get Smart, Perry Mason Tombstone Territory and Barnaby Jones. Dubbed a ""female Brando"" by the press, Paramount Pictures signed her in 1955 and promoted her as the next Marilyn Monroe. Ohmart had top billing in The Scarlet Hour, a Paramount film made by the distinguished director Michael Curtiz about a married woman who persuades her lover to commit a jewelry robbery. Ohmart recalled of the film: ""It was the wrong vehicle to launch me as a star. Frank Tashlin, one of the film's three screenwriters, told me that it had been earlier turned down by Barbara Stanwyck. Foolishly, Paramount let its new leading lady portray a lush, an adulteress wife and a suicide by the film's end."" After nearly $2 million spent promoting her, Ohmart was released from her contract. She co-starred with Anthony Quinn in a 1956 crime drama, The Wild Party. After marrying Wayde Preston, she briefly retired from acting, only to return a year later, in films and television. Producer Jack Warner offered her a supporting role in Born Reckless (1958). Although she did not like the script, she took the role. One of her most noted roles was in William Castle's House on Haunted Hill (1959), playing a murderous wife. In 1962, she returned to New York City to appear in an off-Broadway production titled Banderol. This was followed by a supporting part in the Denis Sanders-directed One Man's Way (1964). Ohmart took a hiatus from appearing in films for several years, selling real estate and becoming involved in studying spiritualism, and ended up in debt. In 1967, she appeared in the exploitation film Caxambu!, followed by a lead role in the cult horror film Spider Baby; according to director Jack Hill, Ohmart was enthusiastic about the project, asking, ""Do you think we can win an Academy Award for this?"" Her last film role was in 1974's The Spectre of Edgar Allan Poe.","Ohmart married three times, most notably to actor Wayde Preston. They wed in 1956 and were divorced in 1958. Her first marriage, in 1949, was to actor Ken Grayson; it was annulled in 1951.

Traberth, taking her husband's surname, and was guarded about her private life. Throughout the late 1960s and 1970s, Ohmart dedicated much of her time studying spiritualism and New Age philosophy, which served as a basis for various poems and short stories she wrote. Around 1973, while filming an episode of Barnaby Jones in Los Angeles, Ohmart was attacked and beaten by three men on a street in Hollywood. After being discharged from the hospital over her injuries, Ohmart was prescribed pain killers, which marked the beginnings of a years-long addiction to prescription medication.

Novello recalled: .mw-parser-output .templatequote{overflow:hidden;margin:1em 0;padding:0 40px}.mw-parser-output .templatequote .templatequotecite{line-height:1.5em;text-align:left;padding-left:1.6em;margin-top:0}",Carol,Ohmart,models
Fernando,Andrews,m,"Ohmart was seen on early television doing commercials, appearing on NBC's Bonny Maid Versatile Varieties (1949–51), which aired Friday nights at 9 p.m. Ohmart was seen pitching floor wax along with Anne Francis and Eva Marie Saint, the other two hosts of the show. She also worked on The 20th Century Fox Hour. Ohmart moved to New York in 1955 where she worked as an understudy on Broadway. She had steady work in television until the early 1970s, with guest roles in Bat Masterson, Ripcord, The Life and Legend of Wyatt Earp, Get Smart, Perry Mason Tombstone Territory and Barnaby Jones. Dubbed a ""female Brando"" by the press, Paramount Pictures signed her in 1955 and promoted her as the next Marilyn Monroe. Ohmart had top billing in The Scarlet Hour, a Paramount film made by the distinguished director Michael Curtiz about a married woman who persuades her lover to commit a jewelry robbery. Ohmart recalled of the film: ""It was the wrong vehicle to launch me as a star. Frank Tashlin, one of the film's three screenwriters, told me that it had been earlier turned down by Barbara Stanwyck. Foolishly, Paramount let its new leading lady portray a lush, an adulteress wife and a suicide by the film's end."" After nearly $2 million spent promoting her, Ohmart was released from her contract. She co-starred with Anthony Quinn in a 1956 crime drama, The Wild Party. After marrying Wayde Preston, she briefly retired from acting, only to return a year later, in films and television. Producer Jack Warner offered her a supporting role in Born Reckless (1958). Although she did not like the script, she took the role. One of her most noted roles was in William Castle's House on Haunted Hill (1959), playing a murderous wife. In 1962, she returned to New York City to appear in an off-Broadway production titled Banderol. This was followed by a supporting part in the Denis Sanders-directed One Man's Way (1964). Ohmart took a hiatus from appearing in films for several years, selling real estate and becoming involved in studying spiritualism, and ended up in debt. In 1967, she appeared in the exploitation film Caxambu!, followed by a lead role in the cult horror film Spider Baby; according to director Jack Hill, Ohmart was enthusiastic about the project, asking, ""Do you think we can win an Academy Award for this?"" Her last film role was in 1974's The Spectre of Edgar Allan Poe.","Ohmart married three times, most notably to actor Wayde Preston. They wed in 1956 and were divorced in 1958. Her first marriage, in 1949, was to actor Ken Grayson; it was annulled in 1951. In 1978, she married William Traberth in Wyoming, a veteran and former firefighter, and retired in Sequim, Washington, a suburb of Seattle. She changed her name to Kariomar S. Traberth, taking her husband's surname, and was guarded about her private life. Throughout the late 1960s and 1970s, Ohmart dedicated much of her time studying spiritualism and New Age philosophy, which served as a basis for various poems and short stories she wrote. Around 1973, while filming an episode of Barnaby Jones in Los Angeles, Ohmart was attacked and beaten by three men on a street in Hollywood. After being discharged from the hospital over her injuries, Ohmart was prescribed pain killers, which marked the beginnings of a years-long addiction to prescription medication. In 1989, Ohmart agreed to be the subject of an extensive profile in the Los Angeles Times. In the profile, Ohmart revealed that she had an estranged relationship with her mother, who did not know of her daughter's whereabouts for the last ten years of her life, up until her death in 1987.

Bernice,Tomei,f,"Peabody was born on January 11, 1948 in Portland, Oregon, though she grew up in Miami, Florida where she pursued acting at a very young age. In the mid 1960s, Peabody made her debut appearance in the educational film that delved into drug abuse called Misfits. The film was produced by a company in the New York area and she got the part after one of the actresses was unable to commit to filming after becoming sick with an ailment. In the early 1970s, she was mostly cast in low-budget drive-in films that were being shot in Florida such as The Horse Killer (1970), which Peabody stated, ""It was actually based on the true story of a man who castrated horses! It was a really bizarre story, but it wasn't like Last House, with sex or murder. It was more of a mystery, where these incidents were happening and they were trying to find this weird guy who was doing it. I was playing the girlfriend, and we had a lot of scenes riding horses and that sort of thing. In 1970, Peabody had a supporting role as The Sun in Robert Kalfin's Off-Broadway production Tarot which ran at the Brooklyn Academy of Music. Additionally, she began to appear on television in commercials and on the two soap operas All My Children and As the World Turns in supporting roles. She was later cast alongside Spalding Grey and Philip Baker Hall in the 1971 film Love-In 72. Following her appearances in Miami productions, Peabody subsequently moved to New York in pursuit of more acting opportunities and for school. At 24 years old, Peabody rose to international prominence when she was cast in Wes Craven's brutal and controversial 1972 rape and revenge horror film The Last House on the Left, about two teenage girls, Mari Collingwood (played by Peabody) and Phyllis Stone (played by Lucy Grantham) who are kidnapped and brutally raped by a gang of psychotic convicts who recently escaped from prison. Returning to New York after a cross-country road trip, she was originally asked by the film makers to audition for the role of Phyllis after responding to casting notice in the trade publication Backstage. After meeting the producer Sean S. Cunningham she was chosen to play the lead, Mari. Craven stated, ""I liked Sandra Peabody a lot; I thought she was very pretty, and very plucky... because she was a very young actress, she wasn't nearly as confident and easy going as Lucy was, and she had become involved in something very, very rough. And she hung in there. When the character was raped, she was treated very roughly, and I know Sandra said to me afterwards, 'My God... I had the feeling they really hated me.'""  The film was a critical and commercial success, earning more than $3 million at the American box office and her performance was generally met with positive reviews. During one of the screenings for the cast, Peabody was watching the film with her mother and unhappy with what she was seeing, she ultimately walked out.  Editor Stefano Lo Verme compared Peabody's performance as Mari and the trajectory of her career to the performances of Marilyn Burns as Sally Hardesty in The Texas Chain Saw Massacre (1974) and Jamie Lee Curtis as Laurie Strode in Halloween (1978) and their subsequent line of work within the horror genre.   She later starred in Case of the Full Moon Murders (1973), which was filmed in Miami, Florida and was made by a majority of Last House's crew, being directed by producer Cunningham and starring her costar Fred J. Lincoln. Peabody was later cast in the horror films Voices of Desire (1972), and Massage Parlor Murders! (1973), the latter being a grindhouse film that was released on DVD and Blu-ray in 2013. Her next role was Olga in the satirical exploitation film The Filthiest Show in Town (1973). In one of her more notable roles after The Last House on the Left, Peabody starred as Minnie in the musical comedy Annie Get Your Gun, from 1973 to 1974 alongside Barbara Eden and John Bennett Perry. Jonathan Takiff of Philadelphia Daily News stated, ""Clinched up in a shapeless bag of a dress, carrying on in a raggle taggle performing style, Sandra Peabody is totally believable as adolescent hick from the sticks. Which is why, obviously, she was selected for the role from a literal army of teenage competitors."" While her character was written as a teenager, Peabody was 25 years old during the production and stated, ""Even the director thought I was a kid, he never found out the truth until I refused to sign a contract which called for an accompanying guardian. Looking young does have its disadvantages, when I first left school (Carnegie-Mellon, in Pittsburg) and started hitting the casting calls in New York, I couldn't get an acting jobs for characters my age. So then I got smart, and signed with a children's agent."" In 1974, Peabody had a cameo role in the horror film Legacy of Satan. The following year, Sandra starred in the comedy film Teenage Hitchhikers, which was about a couple of young hitchhikers who embark on a cross country trip in search of freedom, excitement and independence. In a review for Los Angeles Times, Linda Gross stated that Peabody's performance was ""ingenious."" In a 2016 editorial for the website Birth.Movies.Death., actress Barbara Crampton noted that Peabody was one of the first actresses to be labeled as a ""scream queen"" due to her frequent appearances in horror films, stating: After appearing in Teenage Hitchhikers, Sandra quit acting. In 1975, Peabody worked as the script supervisor for the exploitation film Video Vixens, in which she is credited for the script continuity and featured her Last House costar Steve Miner as the assistant editor. Subsequently, Sandra began to distance herself from the exploitative films that she was becoming known for and began to transition into children's programming. In 1983, she joined Mary Lee Fones and Karen Kalergis in an effort to bring child friendly content to cable systems beyond prominent film industry locations such as Los Angeles and New York. The same year, Peabody created the half-hour children's program Get Moving. In 1990, Sandra wrote and produced the television series Where in the World. The series lasted until 1995. In 2000, David A. Szulkin interviewed Peabody for his book, Wes Craven's Last House on the Left, which tells the inside story of making the film. In 2001, Peabody wrote and produced the educational series Zone In. She created more entries in 2007. Peabody has appeared in several critically acclaimed horror film documentaries through archive footage such as Going to Pieces: The Rise and Fall of the Slasher Film (2006) and Never Sleep Again: The Elm Street Legacy (2010). Peabody was Alicia Lagano's acting coach and in an interview stated: As of 2019, Peabody is reported to be an acting coach and agent in the Portland, Oregon and Los Angeles, California areas.","Peabody graduated from Neighborhood Playhouse School of the Theatre and studied with master acting teacher Sanford Meisner for two years. She obtained a bachelor's degree in Arts and Letters at Carnegie Mellon University. Peabody quit acting in the mid 1970s. Most of the actors that portrayed the villains in The Last House on the Left (1972) stayed in character, and it caused her to feel genuinely frightened throughout most of the shoot. During the more violent scenes of the film, Peabody revealed that she was genuinely upset as she felt unprepared, ""I was upset because I'm an emotional person, and I reacted to what was going on as if it were real. I had a really hard time with some of scenes, because I had come out of American Playhouse, where it was all about preparation, and everything had to be real. I ended up doing a horrible job in the film. I was very upset, and I felt like I should have channeled that, but I couldn't... I was a young actress and I was still learning to balance any emotions I had from outside of the film into my scene work."" Peabody spent a lot of time with Craven who often encouraged her throughout filming the rougher scenes. The experience was very exploitative for the actress and the actors of the film were rather abusive towards her and insensitive to the discomfort that she felt during filming. Sandra states that although she was uncertain how a lot of the scenes would turn out, she trusted Craven and Cunningham and their vision for the film. Marc Sheffler, who portrayed Junior Stillo, revealed in an interview that he held Peabody over a cliff and threatened to throw her off if she messed up during the next shot, stating ""She wasn’t getting the scene. She wasn’t at the anxiety level that she needed to be. So, we’d done it I don’t know how many times … everybody was getting annoyed. So, I said to Wes, 'Give me a minute with her.' What I did was... you can’t see it in the shot but I took her over to the cliff, and I put her over the cliff and just grabbed her and said, ‘If you don’t get this fucking scene right now, I’m going to drop you and Wes’ll shoot it, and we’ll get a different scene, but it’ll work because you’ll be fucking mangled.” Additionally, method actor David Hess actually threatened to assault her during a rape scene in order to get a genuine reaction and often treated her differently than the rest of the cast. Peabody recalled, ""One of the characters was a method actor, so he was trying to live his part... he'd come after us with a knife at night, trying to freak us out. This was the guy with the dark curly hair  – he tried to play his role on and off the set. It was like, 'Lock your doors and windows at night, you don't want him to come get you!'

Hess revealed that he actually got very physical with her during the filming of the rape scene and that she couldn't do anything about it once the camera was running. During this particular shot, assistant director Yvonne Hannemann described it as an upsetting shoot with her having to be consoled by Craven throughout filming it due to the way she was being treated. Peabody revealed that she felt more comfortable around Last House's cinematographer Victor Hurwitz, who she described as a ""fatherly kind of guy"" and stated that he is the person that encouraged her to not pursue acting as a career due to how bleak the industry was. In a retrospective interview, Hess discussed the on set relationship between him and Sandra, stating: ""Sandra was an innocent and I held my character. She didn’t want to get anywhere near me.""","Tomei was born on January 11, 1948 in Portland, Oregon, though she grew up in Miami, Florida where she pursued acting at a very young age. In the mid 1960s, Tomei made her debut appearance in the educational film that delved into drug abuse called Misfits. The film was produced by a company in the New York area and she got the part after one of the actresses was unable to commit to filming after becoming sick with an ailment. In the early 1970s, she was mostly cast in low-budget drive-in films that were being shot in Florida such as The Horse Killer (1970), which Tomei stated, ""It was actually based on the true story of a man who castrated horses! It was a really bizarre story, but it wasn't like Last House, with sex or murder. It was more of a mystery, where these incidents were happening and they were trying to find this weird guy who was doing it. I was playing the girlfriend, and we had a lot of scenes riding horses and that sort of thing. In 1970, Tomei had a supporting role as The Sun in Robert Kalfin's Off-Broadway production Tarot which ran at the Brooklyn Academy of Music. Additionally, she began to appear on television in commercials and on the two soap operas All My Children and As the World Turns in supporting roles. She was later cast alongside Spalding Grey and Philip Baker Hall in the 1971 film Love-In 72. Following her appearances in Miami productions, Tomei subsequently moved to New York in pursuit of more acting opportunities and for school. At 24 years old, Tomei rose to international prominence when she was cast in Wes Craven's brutal and controversial 1972 rape and revenge horror film The Last House on the Left, about two teenage girls, Mari Collingwood (played by Tomei) and Phyllis Stone (played by Lucy Grantham) who are kidnapped and brutally raped by a gang of psychotic convicts who recently escaped from prison. Returning to New York after a cross-country road trip, she was originally asked by the film makers to audition for the role of Phyllis after responding to casting notice in the trade publication Backstage. After meeting the producer Sean S. Cunningham she was chosen to play the lead, Mari. Craven stated, ""I liked Bernice Tomei a lot; I thought she was very pretty, and very plucky... because she was a very young actress, she wasn't nearly as confident and easy going as Lucy was, and she had become involved in something very, very rough. And she hung in there. When the character was raped, she was treated very roughly, and I know Bernice said to me afterwards, 'My God... I had the feeling they really hated me.'""  The film was a critical and commercial success, earning more than $3 million at the American box office and her performance was generally met with positive reviews. During one of the screenings for the cast, Tomei was watching the film with her mother and unhappy with what she was seeing, she ultimately walked out.  Editor Stefano Lo Verme compared Tomei's performance as Mari and the trajectory of her career to the performances of Marilyn Burns as Sally Hardesty in The Texas Chain Saw Massacre (1974) and Jamie Lee Curtis as Laurie Strode in Halloween (1978) and their subsequent line of work within the horror genre.   She later starred in Case of the Full Moon Murders (1973), which was filmed in Miami, Florida and was made by a majority of Last House's crew, being directed by producer Cunningham and starring her costar Fred J. Lincoln. Tomei was later cast in the horror films Voices of Desire (1972), and Massage Parlor Murders! (1973), the latter being a grindhouse film that was released on DVD and Blu-ray in 2013. Her next role was Olga in the satirical exploitation film The Filthiest Show in Town (1973). In one of her more notable roles after The Last House on the Left, Tomei starred as Minnie in the musical comedy Annie Get Your Gun, from 1973 to 1974 alongside Barbara Eden and John Bennett Perry. Jonathan Takiff of Philadelphia Daily News stated, ""Clinched up in a shapeless bag of a dress, carrying on in a raggle taggle performing style, Bernice Tomei is totally believable as adolescent hick from the sticks. Which is why, obviously, she was selected for the role from a literal army of teenage competitors."" While her character was written as a teenager, Tomei was 25 years old during the production and stated, ""Even the director thought I was a kid, he never found out the truth until I refused to sign a contract which called for an accompanying guardian. Looking young does have its disadvantages, when I first left school (Carnegie-Mellon, in Pittsburg) and started hitting the casting calls in New York, I couldn't get an acting jobs for characters my age. So then I got smart, and signed with a children's agent."" In 1974, Tomei had a cameo role in the horror film Legacy of Satan. The following year, Bernice starred in the comedy film Teenage Hitchhikers, which was about a couple of young hitchhikers who embark on a cross country trip in search of freedom, excitement and independence. In a review for Los Angeles Times, Linda Gross stated that Tomei's performance was ""ingenious."" In a 2016 editorial for the website Birth.Movies.Death., actress Barbara Crampton noted that Tomei was one of the first actresses to be labeled as a ""scream queen"" due to her frequent appearances in horror films, stating: After appearing in Teenage Hitchhikers, Bernice quit acting. In 1975, Tomei worked as the script supervisor for the exploitation film Video Vixens, in which she is credited for the script continuity and featured her Last House costar Steve Miner as the assistant editor. Subsequently, Bernice began to distance herself from the exploitative films that she was becoming known for and began to transition into children's programming. In 1983, she joined Mary Lee Fones and Karen Kalergis in an effort to bring child friendly content to cable systems beyond prominent film industry locations such as Los Angeles and New York. The same year, Tomei created the half-hour children's program Get Moving. In 1990, Bernice wrote and produced the television series Where in the World. The series lasted until 1995. In 2000, David A. Szulkin interviewed Tomei for his book, Wes Craven's Last House on the Left, which tells the inside story of making the film. In 2001, Tomei wrote and produced the educational series Zone In. She created more entries in 2007. Tomei has appeared in several critically acclaimed horror film documentaries through archive footage such as Going to Pieces: The Rise and Fall of the Slasher Film (2006) and Never Sleep Again: The Elm Street Legacy (2010). Tomei was Alicia Lagano's acting coach and in an interview stated: As of 2019, Tomei is reported to be an acting coach and agent in the Portland, Oregon and Los Angeles, California areas.Tomei graduated from Neighborhood Playhouse School of the Theatre and studied with master acting teacher Sanford Meisner for two years. She obtained a bachelor's degree in Arts and Letters at Carnegie Mellon University. Tomei quit acting in the mid 1970s. Most of the actors that portrayed the villains in The Last House on the Left (1972) stayed in character, and it caused her to feel genuinely frightened throughout most of the shoot. During the more violent scenes of the film, Tomei revealed that she was genuinely upset as she felt unprepared, ""I was upset because I'm an emotional person, and I reacted to what was going on as if it were real. I had a really hard time with some of scenes, because I had come out of American Playhouse, where it was all about preparation, and everything had to be real. I ended up doing a horrible job in the film. I was very upset, and I felt like I should have channeled that, but I couldn't... I was a young actress and I was still learning to balance any emotions I had from outside of the film into my scene work."" Tomei spent a lot of time with Craven who often encouraged her throughout filming the rougher scenes. The experience was very exploitative for the actress and the actors of the film were rather abusive towards her and insensitive to the discomfort that she felt during filming. Bernice states that although she was uncertain how a lot of the scenes would turn out, she trusted Craven and Cunningham and their vision for the film. Marc Sheffler, who portrayed Junior Stillo, revealed in an interview that he held Tomei over a cliff and threatened to throw her off if she messed up during the next shot, stating ""She wasn’t getting the scene. She wasn’t at the anxiety level that she needed to be. So, we’d done it I don’t know how many times … everybody was getting annoyed. So, I said to Wes, 'Give me a minute with her.' What I did was... you can’t see it in the shot but I took her over to the cliff, and I put her over the cliff and just grabbed her and said, ‘If you don’t get this fucking scene right now, I’m going to drop you and Wes’ll shoot it, and we’ll get a different scene, but it’ll work because you’ll be fucking mangled.” Additionally, method actor David Hess actually threatened to assault her during a rape scene in order to get a genuine reaction and often treated her differently than the rest of the cast. Tomei recalled, ""One of the characters was a method actor, so he was trying to live his part... he'd come after us with a knife at night, trying to freak us out. This was the guy with the dark curly hair  – he tried to play his role on and off the set. It was like, 'Lock your doors and windows at night, you don't want him to come get you!' I was scared; I thought this guy had been a killer at some point in his past!"" Hess revealed that he actually got very physical with her during the filming of the rape scene and that she couldn't do anything about it once the camera was running.

From there, Perry guest starred on BET's Rap City and made her rapping debut on Trina's Diamond Princess on the track ""Kandi"", which would attract the attention of Missy Elliott.

Adesuwa,Goldstein,f,"Phillips was on the cover of Interview magazine when she was 13. Shortly thereafter, she appeared on the cover of Vogue Italia. Phillips also became an image model for Calvin Klein and appeared in several advertising campaigns in which adolescents showed white underwear. The campaigns were widely condemned as eerily pedophilic. She has expressed her distaste for the modeling world, and once stated in an interview: ""It was like, I wanted to go swimming in the ocean, but I was jumping up and down in a puddle."" After signing a record deal at age 17, Phillips began working on her debut album I'd Rather Eat Glass, produced by Jerry Harrison. It was released on May 11, 1999 by Almo Sounds, and remains her only full-length music release to date. The album's title refers to her past as a fashion model, saying she would ""rather eat glass"" than go back to modeling. Phillips collaborated with a number of artists when writing songs for the album, including Eric Bazilian, Greg Wells, Dave Bassett, Howard Jones and Jill Cunniff. Upon its release, I'd Rather Eat Glass received mixed reviews from music critics, mostly criticising the work for being immature, but her musical style has been positively compared to Natalie Imbruglia or Kay Hanley of Letters to Cleo. Phillips made her film debut in a brief role of the independent drama Sugar Town (1999). Her first major film role came the same year, as an Upper East Side girl trying to fit in with the black hip-hop crowd, in James Toback's drama Black and White, opposite Robert Downey Jr., Jared Leto, Brooke Shields and Elijah Wood. The film received mixed reviews and found a limited audience in theaters, but AllMovie remarked: "" starts off strong with a provocative performance by newcomer Bijou Phillips as the most unapologetic seeker of approval from her hip-hop-loving friends. Phillips eventually fades into the background, and the film becomes hampered by Toback's insistence upon grafting a standard crime-drama plot"". Phillips appeared with Kate Hudson in Cameron Crowe's semi-biographical musical drama Almost Famous (2000). The film was a success and received four Academy Awards nominations. 2001 saw Phillips star in two independent coming-of-age films. In Tart, opposite Dominique Swain and Melanie Griffith, she played the longtime friend of a young woman at a preparatory school in 1980s New York City. PopMatters found Phillips to be one of the only intriguing actors in the film, ""thanks to yet another fearless performance"". In Bully, based on the 1993 murder of Bobby Kent, she took on the role of one in a group of several young adults in South Florida who enact a murder plot against a mutual friend who has emotionally, physically and sexually abused them for years. The film had a mixed critical response, but famed critic Roger Ebert was one of its notable admirers and gave it four out of four stars. Her performance in the film led The Hollywood Reporter to name her one of 2002's ""Shooting Stars of Tomorrow"". In 2003, Phillips starred as a member of a bizarre cult of young criminals, alongside Mischa Barton, in the thriller Octane, which premiered at the Cannes Film Festival. In 2004, she played the nanny of an author's young daughter, with Jeff Bridges and Kim Basinger, in The Door in the Floor (2004), a drama with heavy sexual themes adapted from the novel A Widow for One Year by John Irving. Phillips starred with Anne Hathaway in the drama Havoc (2005) as a spoiled socialite, appearing nude in some of its scenes. ViewLondon wrote that the ""supporting cast are superb, particularly Bijou Phillips"" as the ""trashy best friend"", while Variety asserted: ""As played by Hathaway and Phillips, the friendship between  rings girlish and true, and comes complete with tantalizing, lesbian-flavored moments"". Havoc was not released in theaters in the United States due to unfavorable critical reception. She appeared as an ill-fated high school senior in the slasher film Venom (also 2005), produced by Kevin Williamson. In 2007, Phillips starred in the independent horror film The Wizard of Gore, as the girlfriend of a magic magazine's publisher, and collaborated with actress Lauren German in three films, the first being the comedy-drama Spin, about seven people at a popular Los Angeles nightclub. In Hostel: Part II, which served as a sequel to Hostel (2005), Phillips starred as one of three American female art students in Rome who are directed to a Slovak village where they are kidnapped and taken to a facility in which rich clients pay to torture and kill people. She claimed that her torture sequence, which entails her being scalped by a power saw, required around forty-five setups. ""I don't think I could do something like this again"", she stated in a 2007 interview. ""I'm glad that I had the experience, and I love my job, but we went into places that I didn't know existed, and I don't need to do that again."" Banned from theatrical release in several countries, Hostel: Part II was released theatrically in the United States, to lackluster box office returns. The biographical film What We Do Is Secret featured Phillips as Lorna Doom, the Germs' bassist and a close friend of singer Darby Crash. Director Rodger Grossman cast Phillips when she was 17 years old, and she stayed committed to the project for the entire time it took to bring the film into production, which was almost one decade. She received critical acclaim for her portrayal; Phil Gallo for Variety found her performance to be ""striking"" and stated that her character ""lights up in a unique way whenever she's in Crash's company or simply talking about him."" In 2008, Phillips appeared in the documentary Chelsea on the Rocks, about the Hotel Chelsea, directed by Abel Ferrara, and starred as a milkmaid, opposite Sam Rockwell and Anjelica Huston, in the well-received black comedy Choke, based on the Chuck Palahniuk's novel of the same name. In Dark Streets (her last 2008 film), Phillips played a love interest and the alluring star singer of a club in 1930s New York City. In 2009, Phillips had starring roles in four independent feature films, three of which were opposite Danny Masterson. Her first release in the year was the romantic comedy Wake, in which she played an emotionally isolated, modern woman who meets a man mourning his fiancée at a funeral. The horror film It's Alive, a remake of the 1974 film of the same name written and directed by Larry Cohen, saw Phillips star as a mother who has a murderous baby. Dread Central, in its review for the film, noted: ""Bijou Philips is undoubtedly the star here, jumping into her role in what is admittedly just a piece of schlock cinema with great aplomb"". In the comedy Made for Each Other, Phillips would reunite with Lauren German and also play a woman whose husband decides the only way to morally rectify his cheating is to get his wife to cheat on him. Her last 2009 film was the crime drama The Bridge to Nowhere, portraying a sex worker. In FOX's sitcom Raising Hope (2010–2014), Phillips played the title character's biological mother, and a serial killer sentenced to death. Until its finale, she appeared in a total of seven episodes of the series. In 2010 and 2012, she guest-starred in episodes of the police procedural television series Hawaii Five-0 and Law & Order: Special Victims Unit, and in 2011 she appeared in the video for Broken Social Scene's song ""Sweetest Kill"".

She was born with small kidneys and had been battling the disease by living a stress-free life, eating a vegan diet, and getting dialysis.

In November 2017, actor Daniel Franzese alleged that Phillips had ""ridiculed"" him about his sexuality and weight and physically assaulted him on the set of Bully. Phillips subsequently apologized for her behavior.

Phillips has defended both her late father and her husband (the former accused of rape and incest by Phillips' half-sister Mackenzie, the latter accused of rape and sexual assault by multiple women) in the face of allegations of sexual abuse. Of Mackenzie's allegations against their father, Bijou said, ""I'm 29 now, I've talked to everyone who was around during that time, I've asked the hard questions. I do not believe my sister. Our father  many things. This is not one of them.""

The film received mixed reviews and found a limited audience in theaters, but AllMovie remarked: "" starts off strong with a provocative performance by newcomer Bijou Phillips as the most unapologetic seeker of approval from her hip-hop-loving friends. Phillips eventually fades into the background, and the film becomes hampered by Toback's insistence upon grafting a standard crime-drama plot"". Phillips appeared with Kate Hudson in Cameron Crowe's semi-biographical musical drama Almost Famous (2000). The film was a success and received four Academy Awards nominations. 2001 saw Phillips star in two independent coming-of-age films. In Tart, opposite Dominique Swain and Melanie Griffith, she played the longtime friend of a young woman at a preparatory school in 1980s New York City. PopMatters found Phillips to be one of the only intriguing actors in the film, ""thanks to yet another fearless performance"". In Bully, based on the 1993 murder of Bobby Kent, she took on the role of one in a group of several young adults in South Florida who enact a murder plot against a mutual friend who has emotionally, physically and sexually abused them for years. The film had a mixed critical response, but famed critic Roger Ebert was one of its notable admirers and gave it four out of four stars. Her performance in the film led The Hollywood Reporter to name her one of 2002's ""Shooting Stars of Tomorrow"". In 2003, Phillips starred as a member of a bizarre cult of young criminals, alongside Mischa Barton, in the thriller Octane, which premiered at the Cannes Film Festival. In 2004, she played the nanny of an author's young daughter, with Jeff Bridges and Kim Basinger, in The Door in the Floor (2004), a drama with heavy sexual themes adapted from the novel A Widow for One Year by John Irving. Phillips starred with Anne Hathaway in the drama Havoc (2005) as a spoiled socialite, appearing nude in some of its scenes. ViewLondon wrote that the ""supporting cast are superb, particularly Bijou Phillips"" as the ""trashy best friend"", while Variety asserted: ""As played by Hathaway and Phillips, the friendship between  rings girlish and true, and comes complete with tantalizing, lesbian-flavored moments"". Havoc was not released in theaters in the United States due to unfavorable critical reception. She appeared as an ill-fated high school senior in the slasher film Venom (also 2005), produced by Kevin Williamson. In 2007, Phillips starred in the independent horror film The Wizard of Gore, as the girlfriend of a magic magazine's publisher, and collaborated with actress Lauren German in three films, the first being the comedy-drama Spin, about seven people at a popular Los Angeles nightclub. In Hostel: Part II, which served as a sequel to Hostel (2005), Phillips starred as one of three American female art students in Rome who are directed to a Slovak village where they are kidnapped and taken to a facility in which rich clients pay to torture and kill people. She claimed that her torture sequence, which entails her being scalped by a power saw, required around forty-five setups. ""I don't think I could do something like this again"", she stated in a 2007 interview. ""I'm glad that I had the experience, and I love my job, but we went into places that I didn't know existed, and I don't need to do that again."" Banned from theatrical release in several countries, Hostel: Part II was released theatrically in the United States, to lackluster box office returns. The biographical film What We Do Is Secret featured Phillips as Lorna Doom, the Germs' bassist and a close friend of singer Darby Crash. Director Rodger Grossman cast Phillips when she was 17 years old, and she stayed committed to the project for the entire time it took to bring the film into production, which was almost one decade. She received critical acclaim for her portrayal; Phil Gallo for Variety found her performance to be ""striking"" and stated that her character ""lights up in a unique way whenever she's in Crash's company or simply talking about him."" In 2008, Phillips appeared in the documentary Chelsea on the Rocks, about the Hotel Chelsea, directed by Abel Ferrara, and starred as a milkmaid, opposite Sam Rockwell and Anjelica Huston, in the well-received black comedy Choke, based on the Chuck Palahniuk's novel of the same name. In Dark Streets (her last 2008 film), Phillips played a love interest and the alluring star singer of a club in 1930s New York City. In 2009, Phillips had starring roles in four independent feature films, three of which were opposite Danny Masterson. Her first release in the year was the romantic comedy Wake, in which she played an emotionally isolated, modern woman who meets a man mourning his fiancée at a funeral. The horror film It's Alive, a remake of the 1974 film of the same name written and directed by Larry Cohen, saw Phillips star as a mother who has a murderous baby. Dread Central, in its review for the film, noted: ""Bijou Philips is undoubtedly the star here, jumping into her role in what is admittedly just a piece of schlock cinema with great aplomb"". In the comedy Made for Each Other, Phillips would reunite with Lauren German and also play a woman whose husband decides the only way to morally rectify his cheating is to get his wife to cheat on him. Her last 2009 film was the crime drama The Bridge to Nowhere, portraying a sex worker. In FOX's sitcom Raising Hope (2010–2014), Phillips played the title character's biological mother, and a serial killer sentenced to death. Until its finale, she appeared in a total of seven episodes of the series. In 2010 and 2012, she guest-starred in episodes of the police procedural television series Hawaii Five-0 and Law & Order: Special Victims Unit, and in 2011 she appeared in the video for Broken Social Scene's song ""Sweetest Kill"". Phillips has not acted since her last appearance in Raising Hope, opting to focus on her family and health.","Phillips dated Sean Lennon and was the muse for his album Friendly Fire after their breakup.In 2004, Phillips began dating Danny Masterson; the couple met at a poker tournament in Las Vegas. They are both Scientologists. The couple announced their engagement in March 2009. They were married on October 18, 2011, in a private castle in Ireland. On February 14, 2014, Phillips gave birth to their daughter, Fianna Francis Masterson. Phillips has starred with Masterson in several films and in a 2011 episode of Fox's Raising Hope. On February 17, 2017, Masterson revealed that Phillips had been suffering from kidney disease for five years. She was born with small kidneys and had been battling the disease by living a stress-free life, eating a vegan diet, and getting dialysis. She suffered from a blood infection and was in need of a transplant. On April 7, 2017, she received a kidney transplant. In November 2017, actor Daniel Franzese alleged that Phillips had ""ridiculed"" him about his sexuality and weight and physically assaulted him on the set of Bully. Phillips subsequently apologized for her behavior. The same month, actress Heather Matarazzo claimed that Phillips had held her against a wall and choked her shortly before filming for Hostel: Part II began. Phillips has defended both her late father and her husband (the former accused of rape and incest by Phillips' half-sister Mackenzie, the latter accused of rape and sexual assault by multiple women) in the face of allegations of sexual abuse. Of Mackenzie's allegations against their father, Bijou said, ""I'm 29 now, I've talked to everyone who was around during that time, I've asked the hard questions. I do not believe my sister. Our father  many things. This is not one of them."" Between 2017 and 2020, Phillips' husband Danny Masterson was accused of rape, harassment and stalking of several women (including Chrissie Carnell-Bixler, the wife of The Mars Volta and At The Drive In frontman Cedric Bixler-Zavala). Masterson has not responded directly to any of the allegations, but on Instagram, Phillips mocked Carnell Bixler's police report detailing Masterson's alleged rape.","drollinger was on the cover of interview magazine when he was 13. shortly thereafter, he appeared on the cover of vogue italia. drollinger also became an image model for calvin klein and appeared in several advertising campaigns in which adolescents showed white underwear. the campaigns were widely condemned as eerily pedophilic. he has expressed his distaste for the modeling world, and once stated in an interview: ""it was like, i wanted to go swimming in the ocean, but i was jumping up and down in a puddle."" after signing a record deal at age 17, drollinger began working on his debut album i'd rather eat glass, produced by jerry harrison. it was released on may 11, 1999 by almo sounds, and remains his only full-length music release to date. the album's title refers to his past as a fashion model, saying he would ""rather eat glass"" than go back to modeling. drollinger collaborated with a number of artists when writing songs for the album, including eric bazilian, greg wells, dave bassett, howard jones and jill cunniff. upon its release, i'd rather eat glass received mixed reviews from music critics, mostly criticising the work for being immature, but his musical style has been positively compared to natalie imbruglia or kay hanley of letters to cleo. drollinger made his film debut in a brief role of the independent drama sugar town (1999). his first major film role came the same year, as an upper east side girl trying to fit in with the black hip-hop crowd, in james toback's drama black and white, opposite robert downey jr., jared leto, brooke shields and elijah wood. the film received mixed reviews and found a limited audience in theaters, but allmovie remarked: "" starts off strong with a provocative performance by newcomer morton drollinger as the most unapologetic seeker of approval from his hip-hop-loving friends. drollinger eventually fades into the background, and the film becomes hampered by toback's insistence upon grafting a standard crime-drama plot"". drollinger appeared with kate hudson in cameron crowe's semi-biographical musical drama almost famous (2000). the film was a success and received four academy awards nominations. 2001 saw drollinger star in two independent coming-of-age films. in tart, opposite dominique swain and melanie griffith, he played the longtime friend of a young woman at a preparatory school in 1980s new york city. popmatters found drollinger to be one of the only intriguing actors in the film, ""thanks to yet another fearless performance"". in bully, based on the 1993 murder of bobby kent, he took on the role of one in a group of several young adults in south florida who enact a murder plot against a mutual friend who has emotionally, physically and sexually abused them for years. the film had a mixed critical response, but famed critic roger ebert was one of its notable admirers and gave it four out of four stars. his performance in the film led the hollywood reporter to name his one of 2002's ""shooting stars of tomorrow"". in 2003, drollinger starred as a member of a bizarre cult of young criminals, alongside mischa barton, in the thriller octane, which premiered at the cannes film festival. in 2004, he played the nanny of an author's young daughter, with jeff bridges and kim basinger, in the door in the floor (2004), a drama with heavy sexual themes adapted from the novel a widow for one year by john irving. drollinger starred with anne hathaway in the drama havoc (2005) as a spoiled socialite, appearing nude in some of its scenes. viewlondon wrote that the ""supporting cast are superb, particularly morton drollinger"" as the ""trashy best friend"", while variety asserted: ""as played by hathaway and drollinger, the friendship between  rings girlish and true, and comes complete with tantalizing, lesbian-flavored moments"". havoc was not released in theaters in the united states due to unfavorable critical reception. he appeared as an ill-fated high school senior in the slasher film venom (also 2005), produced by kevin williamson. in 2007, drollinger starred in the independent horror film the wizard of gore, as the girlfriend of a magic magazine's publisher, and collaborated with actress lauren german in three films, the first being the comedy-drama spin, about seven people at a popular los angeles nightclub. in hostel: part ii, which served as a sequel to hostel (2005), drollinger starred as one of three american female art students in rome who are directed to a slovak village where they are kidnapped and taken to a facility in which rich clients pay to torture and kill people. he claimed that his torture sequence, which entails his being scalped by a power saw, required around forty-five setups.

Television appearances followed, with guest-roles in the short-lived Push and Mortal Kombat: Conquest. She went on to play one of the leads in Jack and Jill, which aired for two seasons, from September 26, 1999 to April 15, 2001 on the WB Network. Pressly headlined the independent film Poor White Trash (2000), playing scheming gold-digger Sandy Lake, and appeared in three 2001 theatrical releases aimed at a teenage audience, which despite varying degrees of success, helped her receive more exposure. The parody film Not Another Teen Movie, most notably, featured her as Priscilla, a high school cheerleader, while she took on the roles of a teen wife in the sex comedy Tomcats and that a Southern love interest in the comedy Joe Dirt, opposite David Spade. In 2002, Pressly starred as a college student trapped in a haunted island in the independent horror film Demon Island. Felix Vasquez of Cinema Crazed regarded it as a guilty pleasure and stated: "" does what she can with her character and comes off as a rather charming character"". She next portrayed a crazed, motorcycle-riding criminal in the action thriller Torque (2004), alongside Ice Cube. In a profile, The New Yorker, describing this phrase of her career, asserted: ""She is typically cast on the strength of her looks and her Southern sassiness, and she has had girlfriend roles in several forgettable teensploitation flicks"". Between 2005 and 2009, Pressly played Joy Turner, the pessimistic, cold-hearted, stubborn and vain ex-wife of a small-time thief, in the NBC sitcom My Name Is Earl, which was a success with critics and audiences. She garnered nominations for a Golden Globe and a Screen Actor Guild Award, and in 2007, she won an Emmy Award for Outstanding Supporting Actress in a Comedy Series for her work on the show. Pressly once called her role her ""greateast release"" and thanked creator Greg Garcia for restoring her faith in the business. She remarked: "" came at a time when I was questioning whether this was the path I wanted to continue following. I was tired of living out of my suitcase, coming and going all the time. I wanted a little normalcy in my life."" During the early run of My Name is Earl, Pressly produced and took on the role of a homicidal magazine editor in the independent film Death to the Supermodels (2005), a role she compared  to that of Reese Witherspoon in Election. In his review for the film, Scott Weinberg of DVDTalk.com, wrote: ""Jaime Pressly is a funny, funny woman. To those of you My Name is Earl fans who are just now discovering the juicy talents of the perpetually sneering, eye-rolling, attitude machine known as Jaime Pressly, I'd recommend you check out her work in flicks like Ringmaster, Tomcats, Joe Dirt, Torque, and Not Another Teen Movie. Basically, if we were giving out an award for ""the consistently best thing in a series of generally atrocious comedies,"" Jaime would be walking home with that prize, no sweat. Regardless of how bad the movie is  Jaime always seems like a kooky and kinetic cartoon character who somehow figured out how to become flesh & blood. Yes, she's sexy and all that, but Jaime Pressly is also funny, and that just amplifies all her other assets"". In DOA: Dead or Alive (2006), a British-German-American martial arts action film, Pressly starred as one of four female fighters working together to uncover the secret that the organizer of an invitational martial arts contest is trying to hide.  While the film was relatively successful on some markets, it only found a limited audience in North America. In 2006, she also hosted the first annual VH1 Rock Honors, and an episode of Saturday Night Live, and guest-starred on MADtv, playing Hillary Clinton in a parody of My Name Is Earl, ""My Name Is Dubya"", in which George W. Bush (Frank Caliendo) makes a list of all the bad things he has done in the past and rectifies them one by one. She voiced a bird in the computer-animated comedy hit Horton Hears a Who! (2008), featuring Jim Carrey, Steve Carell, Will Arnett, among others. In I Love You, Man (2009), Pressly starred opposite Paul Rudd and Jason Segel, as the best friend of a bride-to-be and one half of a volatile married couple. The film received critical acclaim and was a box office success, grossing US$92 million worldwide. Rolling Stone found her ""terrific"" in her role, asserting: ""Her battles with  have genuine comic bite"". The ABC Family television film Beauty & the Briefcase (2010), co-starring Hilary Duff, featured Pressly as a primary editor at Cosmopolitan magazine. The premiere received 2.4 million viewers attracting a strong female audience that drove the network to an all-time high in viewers. Smoke Screen, another 2010 television film, saw her star as a reporter finding herself in the middle of a murder investigation when she wakes up next to a dead body. In 2010, Pressly also guest-starred in two episodes of the CBS comedy Rules of Engagement, as a possible surrogate mother for Jeff and Audrey (Patrick Warburton and Megyn Price). In 6 Month Rule (2011), an independent film released for limited theaters and digital markets, Pressly played what was described as a ""harridan of an ex-fiancée"" by the New York Times. She appeared in the interactive educational children's musical comedy The Oogieloves in the Big Balloon Adventure (2012), as a flamenco dancer riding a giant flying sombrero. Budgeted at US$20 million, the film only made US$445,000 in more than 2,000 screens during its opening weekend. Pressly next had regular roles in two short-lived series. The FOX sitcom I Hate My Teenage Daughter (2012–2013) saw her portray a mother fearing her daughter is turning into the kind of girl who tormented her in high school, while the TV Land comedy Jennifer Falls (2014) featured her as a single mother, who after being fired from a high-paying job, becomes a waitress in her brother's bar. Pressly obtained leading roles in three 2014 film releases. In A Haunted House 2, Pressly starred as a mother of two and one half of an interracial couple, alongside Marlon Wayans. She had known Wayans for 15 years prior filming and the project marked the first time they worked together. Describing the process, she said: ""It was a match made in heaven. It really was.

The film was panned by critics, but was a decent box office success. She starred opposite singer Robin Thicke in the romantic comedy Making the Rules, which was filmed in 2012. Finders Keepers, a television horror film, saw Pressley play a divorced mother whose life is thrown into turmoil when her young daughter becomes obsessed with an evil doll left behind by the previous owners. Beginning in 2014, Pressly has portrayed Jill Kendall, a wealthy socialite and alcoholic, in the CBS sitcom Mom.","Pressly has revealed in interviews that she briefly struggled with bulimia as a teenager.

Rebekah,Lord,f,"While signing modeling posters for Jonathan Gold, a talent agent and professional wrestling promoter, Psaltis jokingly told Gold that she would be interested in pursuing a career in wrestling. Gold took her comment at face value and later contacted Psaltis, informing her that she was scheduled to appear at a wrestling show in New Jersey. With some trepidation, she went to the show and managed Tony Atlas in his match against Jimmy Snuka. Psaltis made her professional wrestling debut in January 1995. She met her future fiancé Simon Diamond during her time in the independent wrestling promotions. She also met Buddy Landell and Devon Storm, both of whom helped train her. Psaltis spent four years working on the northeastern independent circuit, appearing with promotions such as Maryland Championship Wrestling and the Mid-Eastern Wrestling Federation. In 1998, Psaltis was informed that Extreme Championship Wrestling (ECW) employee Buh Buh Ray Dudley was interested in bringing her into ECW. At the behest of Dudley, Psaltis traveled to the ECW Arena in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, where ECW promoter Paul Heyman told her that he would book her for several appearances in an angle with Lance Storm. She debuted in ECW on August 28, 1998 as the manager of Storm, feuding with Chris Candido and his manager, Tammy Lynn Sytch. Although she was only supposed to have a three-week role in the company, Heyman was impressed by the chemistry between Psaltis and Storm and offered her a contract, which she accepted. Psaltis created her character to be in love with Storm and clumsy rather than glamorous. Storm and Psaltis feuded with Candido and Sytch for several months, during which time Psaltis was renamed ""Tammy Lynn Bytch"" to spite Candido and his manager. After the respective feuds ended, she used the ring name ""Dawn Marie Bytch,"" which was eventually shortened to simply Dawn Marie. After Storm formed a tag team with Justin Credible known as the Impact Players in the summer of 1999, she managed both men, helping them win the ECW Tag Team Championship on two occasions. Psaltis continued to manage Storm until he left ECW for World Championship Wrestling (WCW) in May 2000. Psaltis was also offered a contract by WCW, but declined to leave ECW in order to remain with her fiancé, ECW wrestler Simon Diamond. She also had two years left on her ECW contract. After Storm departed ECW, Psaltis became a color commentator on ECW pay-per-views and the television series ECW on TNN. On December 3, 2000 at the Massacre on 34th Street pay-per-view, as part of a new angle, she announced that she would become the manager of the winner of the opening match pitting Simon Diamond and Swinger against Christian York and Joey Matthews. Although York and Matthews won the bout, Psaltis opted to join forces with Diamond and Swinger, whom she managed until ECW declared bankruptcy in April 2001. Following the bankruptcy of ECW, Psaltis returned to the independent circuit, managing Diamond. The duo made several appearances alongside Swinger with the short lived X Wrestling Federation in November 2001. During her time on the independent circuit, she trained as a wrestler under Simon Diamond and Mikey Whipwreck. Also in 2001, Psaltis worked as a stock trader, and in 2002, she co-hosted a syndicated wrestling radio show known as the ""Piledriver Rock and Wrestling Radio Show"". In April 2002, Psaltis began negotiating with the World Wrestling Federation (WWF), eventually agreeing to a deal. She made her World Wrestling Entertainment (WWE) television debut on the May 30 episode of SmackDown! as Vince McMahon's legal assistant. She debuted with the name ""Dawn Marie Rinaldi"" although it was quickly shortened to the original ""Dawn Marie"". In her initial storyline, she briefly feuded with Stacy Keibler over McMahon's affections until McMahon turned over the General Management position to his daughter, Stephanie McMahon, which was followed shortly by Keibler's departure for the RAW brand. Psaltis would begin a controversial feud with Torrie Wilson in 2002. On the October 17 episode of Smackdown!, Marie picked up her first victory when she teamed up with Matt Hardy to defeat Rikishi and Torrie Wilson. In the angle, Psaltis developed a relationship with Wilson's real-life father Al Wilson. On the edition of November 7 of Smackdown!, Psaltis became engaged to Al. In December, Psaltis would attempt to bribe Wilson by inviting her to a hotel one night; if she arrived, she would break off the engagement. Footage of the event would later be shown at the Armageddon  pay-per-view. Despite this, as part of the angle, the couple remained engaged, and the two got married on the January 2, 2003 episode of Smackdown!. Al then, in storyline, died from a heart attack after having rigorous sex numerous times in succession on their honeymoon. In response, Wilson defeated Psaltis at No Mercy in October. She defeated Psaltis again at the Royal Rumble in 2003 in what was billed as a Stepmother vs. Stepdaughter match. On Smackdown on March 13, 2003 Dawn Marie flashed the crowd, unbuttoning her outfit and opening it completely. Numerous YouTube videos were made of this episode. In May 2004, Psaltis began a second feud with Wilson. As part of the feud, the two had a match with Wilson's career on the line when the SmackDown! General Manager at the time, Kurt Angle, made the stipulation for the match at Judgment Day, which Wilson won. After being on hiatus from SmackDown! programming, Psaltis returned in September and began a new storyline with Miss Jackie, involving whether she and Jackie's fiancée, Charlie Haas, had an affair. This angle led up to a match between the two at Armageddon, with Haas as the guest referee. Psaltis won the match, but afterward, Haas confirmed their affair and broke off both relationships.

She also took acting classes with the intention of becoming an actress after her career in professional wrestling was over. Psaltis began dating Simon Diamond in October 1998. Before dating, the two had been good friends for almost two years. They had planned to be married by the end of 2000 or into 2001. They did not wed, but stayed engaged for several years afterwards. After seven years together, their relationship had come to an end. Later, Psaltis met a man named Matthew, whom she married in June 2005 in Las Vegas. In December 2005, Psaltis gave birth to her first child, a boy named Matthew. In January 2006, she filed a complaint against WWE with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, claiming that her contract had been wrongfully terminated as a result of her pregnancy and that she had suffered mental duress as a result of the release. The case was reportedly settled in late 2007. Psaltis gave birth to her second child, a girl named Katelyn Marie in May 2009.","While signing modeling posters for Jonathan Gold, a talent agent and professional wrestling promoter, Lord jokingly told Gold that she would be interested in pursuing a career in wrestling. Gold took her comment at face value and later contacted Lord, informing her that she was scheduled to appear at a wrestling show in New Jersey. With some trepidation, she went to the show and managed Tony Atlas in his match against Jimmy Snuka. Lord made her professional wrestling debut in January 1995. She met her future fiancé Simon Diamond during her time in the independent wrestling promotions. She also met Buddy Landell and Devon Storm, both of whom helped train her. Lord spent four years working on the northeastern independent circuit, appearing with promotions such as Maryland Championship Wrestling and the Mid-Eastern Wrestling Federation. In 1998, Lord was informed that Extreme Championship Wrestling (ECW) employee Buh Buh Ray Dudley was interested in bringing her into ECW. At the behest of Dudley, Lord traveled to the ECW Arena in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, where ECW promoter Paul Heyman told her that he would book her for several appearances in an angle with Lance Storm. She debuted in ECW on August 28, 1998 as the manager of Storm, feuding with Chris Candido and his manager, Tammy Lynn Sytch. Although she was only supposed to have a three-week role in the company, Heyman was impressed by the chemistry between Lord and Storm and offered her a contract, which she accepted. Lord created her character to be in love with Storm and clumsy rather than glamorous. Storm and Lord feuded with Candido and Sytch for several months, during which time Lord was renamed ""Tammy Lynn Bytch"" to spite Candido and his manager. After the respective feuds ended, she used the ring name ""Rebekah Marie Bytch,"" which was eventually shortened to simply Rebekah Marie. After Storm formed a tag team with Justin Credible known as the Impact Players in the summer of 1999, she managed both men, helping them win the ECW Tag Team Championship on two occasions. Lord continued to manage Storm until he left ECW for World Championship Wrestling (WCW) in May 2000. Lord was also offered a contract by WCW, but declined to leave ECW in order to remain with her fiancé, ECW wrestler Simon Diamond. She also had two years left on her ECW contract. After Storm departed ECW, Lord became a color commentator on ECW pay-per-views and the television series ECW on TNN. On December 3, 2000 at the Massacre on 34th Street pay-per-view, as part of a new angle, she announced that she would become the manager of the winner of the opening match pitting Simon Diamond and Swinger against Christian York and Joey Matthews. Although York and Matthews won the bout, Lord opted to join forces with Diamond and Swinger, whom she managed until ECW declared bankruptcy in April 2001. Following the bankruptcy of ECW, Lord returned to the independent circuit, managing Diamond. The duo made several appearances alongside Swinger with the short lived X Wrestling Federation in November 2001. During her time on the independent circuit, she trained as a wrestler under Simon Diamond and Mikey Whipwreck. Also in 2001, Lord worked as a stock trader, and in 2002, she co-hosted a syndicated wrestling radio show known as the ""Piledriver Rock and Wrestling Radio Show"". In April 2002, Lord began negotiating with the World Wrestling Federation (WWF), eventually agreeing to a deal. She made her World Wrestling Entertainment (WWE) television debut on the May 30 episode of SmackDown! as Vince McMahon's legal assistant. She debuted with the name ""Rebekah Marie Rinaldi"" although it was quickly shortened to the original ""Rebekah Marie"". In her initial storyline, she briefly feuded with Stacy Keibler over McMahon's affections until McMahon turned over the General Management position to his daughter, Stephanie McMahon, which was followed shortly by Keibler's departure for the RAW brand. Lord would begin a controversial feud with Torrie Wilson in 2002. On the October 17 episode of Smackdown!, Marie picked up her first victory when she teamed up with Matt Hardy to defeat Rikishi and Torrie Wilson. In the angle, Lord developed a relationship with Wilson's real-life father Al Wilson. On the edition of November 7 of Smackdown!, Lord became engaged to Al. In December, Lord would attempt to bribe Wilson by inviting her to a hotel one night; if she arrived, she would break off the engagement. Footage of the event would later be shown at the Armageddon  pay-per-view. Despite this, as part of the angle, the couple remained engaged, and the two got married on the January 2, 2003 episode of Smackdown!. Al then, in storyline, died from a heart attack after having rigorous sex numerous times in succession on their honeymoon. In response, Wilson defeated Lord at No Mercy in October. She defeated Lord again at the Royal Rumble in 2003 in what was billed as a Stepmother vs. Stepdaughter match. On Smackdown on March 13, 2003 Rebekah Marie flashed the crowd, unbuttoning her outfit and opening it completely. Numerous YouTube videos were made of this episode. In May 2004, Lord began a second feud with Wilson. As part of the feud, the two had a match with Wilson's career on the line when the SmackDown! General Manager at the time, Kurt Angle, made the stipulation for the match at Judgment Day, which Wilson won. After being on hiatus from SmackDown! programming, Lord returned in September and began a new storyline with Miss Jackie, involving whether she and Jackie's fiancée, Charlie Haas, had an affair. This angle led up to a match between the two at Armageddon, with Haas as the guest referee. Lord won the match, but afterward, Haas confirmed their affair and broke off both relationships.

Tom,Cage,m,"Wiedemann worked as a fashion model and spokesperson for over 10 years before Impatient Foodie. She was discovered by Bruce Weber and quickly became one of the industry's most coveted models, shooting with photographers such as Karl Lagerfeld, Patrick Demarchelier, Annie Leibovitz, Arthur Elgort, Mario Testino, and Craig McDean for magazines such as American Vogue, French Vogue, Harpers Bazaar, Another, Muse, GQ, French Elle and Italian Elle, to name a few. She has also been a spokesmodel for Lancôme since 2004 and done ads for Lancôme makeup, fragrance, and skin care worldwide. While she was modeling, Wiedemann attended graduate school at the London School of Economics (LSE), ultimately receiving her Masters of Science (MSc) in Biomedicine, Biosciences and Society in 2010.  Her MSc dissertation was an analysis of a biotech proposal known as Vertical Farming and the future of feeding urban populations in light of climate change. At the time, her dissertation was the first ever cross-disciplinary analysis of Vertical Farming, for which she received the top possible mark of a Distinction. Upon graduation from the LSE, Wiedemann launched a pop-up restaurant, GOODNESS, which fused her passion for food with fashion. GOODNESS featured a different chef and different menu every day was an immediate success.

Zahra,Raye,f,"Runnels was originally a make-up artist for CNN from 1985 to 1991, where she worked on Larry King's make-up. On the weekends, she did makeup for the wrestlers of Jim Crockett Promotions (JCP). When the company was purchased by Ted Turner in 1988 and renamed World Championship Wrestling (WCW), she moved to Atlanta and continued doing make-up for some of the wrestlers. Booker Ole Anderson eventually asked her to become part of the roster as a manager. Runnels debuted in 1990 as Alexandra York, a laptop-carrying accountant who led an alliance known as the York Foundation, a group of wrestlers with finance-themed gimmicks. The York character was created over a lunch with Tony Schiavone, one of WCW's announcers. She worked at WCW for two years. Runnels debuted in the World Wrestling Federation at the Royal Rumble in 1996 as Marlena, a character modeled after Marlene Dietrich. She debuted as a coolly unconcerned and indifferent manager. With her cigar-smoking, seductive, nonchalant and mysterious gimmick, she acted as the manager of her then real-life husband Dustin, who was wrestling under the gimmick of Goldust. The cigar-smoking aspect of the character came about because Runnels enjoyed smoking them in real life. The risque characters helped bring about The Attitude Era of the late-1990s and the Diva division. During a feud between Goldust and Triple H over the Intercontinental Championship, on February 16, 1997 at In Your House 13: Final Four, Marlena was choked by Chyna, who debuted as a plant from a ringside seat and later became the bodyguard for Triple H. Later, Brian Pillman feuded with Goldust over Marlena. As part of the angle, Pillman won Marlena in a match and sent Goldust a picture of her handcuffed in a bed. Pillman, however, died in the middle of the storyline. Originally, the plan was to have the rivalry culminate in an on-air wedding where Marlena would leave Goldust for Pillman. After the Marlena-Goldust alliance dissolved, Goldust revealed Luna Vachon as his new manager. Runnels later re-emerged in 1998, under her real name, as the on-screen girlfriend of Val Venis. When Runnels claimed to be pregnant with Venis' baby, he dumped her. She later joined forces with Jacqueline Moore, who had just ended her alliance with Marc Mero, to form the Pretty Mean Sisters (P.M.S.). They later formed an alliance with D'Lo Brown and Mark Henry, accompanying them to the ring for a match against Venis and The Godfather in December at Rock Bottom: In Your House. In January, Runnels claimed to have suffered a miscarriage after she was knocked off the ring apron by Brown. Weeks later, Brown discovered that Runnels had never been pregnant. P.M.S. gained a ""love slave"" named Meat in May, whom Runnels controlled using sex. As a part of the storyline, P.M.S. used Meat for his body, forcing him to have sex with them. The alliance, however, broke up by July, when Jacqueline Moore became frustrated with Runnels' infatuation with Meat. In late 1999, Runnels arranged the Terri Invitational Tournament, a best-of-five series, between Edge and Christian and The Hardy Boyz, with the winner receiving her managerial services and the sum of $100,000. The Hardy Boyz won the tournament, which culminated in a ladder match at No Mercy (with the prize money suspended above the ring in a bag). Runnels spent the next few months as their manager until she was injured when Bubba Ray Dudley powerbombed her through a table. She returned on February 27 at No Way Out and cost the Hardy Boyz a match. She then became the manager of Edge and Christian, and the storyline originally called for her to come between the duo, resulting in them becoming singles wrestlers with Runnels managing Christian. The storyline, however, was rewritten, and on an episode of SmackDown!, Edge and Christian—who would now continue wrestling as a tag team—revealed they no longer wanted Runnels's services. She, therefore, slapped Edge, who responded by spearing her. Runnels began a rivalry with The Kat, and at WrestleMania 2000, Runnels (accompanied by The Fabulous Moolah) defeated The Kat (with Mae Young) in a catfight. Val Venis was the Special Guest Referee, but was distracted when Young kissed him in response to Venis making out with both Runnels and The Kat. This distraction allowed Moolah to pull The Kat out of the ring, and when Venis saw her out of the ring, he declared Runnels the winner. Post-match, The Kat attacked Runnels by stripping her black body suit off to expose her nude colored thong. The rivalry continued in an arm wrestling match at Insurrextion. They later participated in a ""Stink Face match"" at SummerSlam, which The Kat won by first performing the move on Runnels. Runnels later became the onscreen girlfriend and manager of Perry Saturn, who was a member of The Radicalz alliance. She accompanied Saturn to the ring at Fully Loaded in July 2000, where Saturn defeated Eddie Guerrero for the European Championship. Saturn, Runnels, and Radicalz member Dean Malenko also had a series of matches with Team Xtreme (The Hardy Boyz and Lita). The on-screen partnership lasted until Saturn, who had hit his head during a match, opted to continue seeing ""Moppy"" (a mop he believed was alive) instead of Runnels. As a result, she then became the manager of Raven, a member of The Alliance, who stole Saturn's mop and fed it into a woodchipper. In late 2001, Terri replaced Trish Stratus as the host of the WWF recap program Excess. She briefly feuded with Stratus, resulting in a wet T-shirt contest between the two on Raw. During this time, she also became the backstage interviewer on Raw and began to wrestle occasionally. On May 27, 2002, she briefly held the perpetually contested Hardcore Championship when she pinned Steven Richards, though he immediately pinned her to regain the title. After eight years with the company, in March 2004, Runnels was released from WWE prior to a massive firing spree. In an April 2015 interview with Vince Russo, Runnels stated that she was flown up on April 1, 2004 to the WWE offices for a meeting with WWE executives Kevin Dunn and John Laurinaitis where she was told that they were parting ways with her; the reason she was told that she was flown up was because the WWE respected her. After leaving the company, Runnels spent time traveling the world. On January 22, 2018, in the Raw 25 Years special episode, Terri was honored as part of a segment involving women considered legends that contributed to the company's success, including the Bella Twins, Maryse, Kelly Kelly, Lilian Garcia, Torrie Wilson, Michelle McCool, Maria Kanellis and the Hall of Famers Jacqueline and Trish Stratus.","Boatright grew up in Florida. She grew up as a Southern Baptist, but later became non-denominational. She dated Brian Pillman in 1990 while they were both in WCW. In 1993, she married Dustin Runnels, whom she met while they were both working for WCW, taking his last name as her own. They have a daughter, Dakota, who was born in 1994. Dustin Runnels' strained relationship with his father Dusty Rhodes caused problems in their marriage, and Terri alleges that Dusty spread rumors about her that included infidelity and gold-digging. The couple divorced in 1999 after six years of marriage. Years after the divorce, they were able to have a ""better relationship"". In 2003, she began a relationship with Tyree Clowe, a US soldier 15 years her junior. The couple remained together for over five years. Terri began dating former professional wrestler New Jack in 2009. Jack professed his love for her in an interview with host Fat Man After Dark on the Future Endeavors wrestling radio show and described some of the pitfalls, even today, of a mixed-race relationship. As of July 2011, the couple is no longer together. In August 2011, a Florida judge ordered Jack to stop selling nude and bloody photographs of Runnels. Runnels filed suit, accusing Jack of making libelous comments about her and requested that a court ban him from distributing sexually-explicit photographs of her. Jack said that he took the photos, that they belonged to him and that he should be free to pass them on to whoever he pleases. A judge in Sanford, Florida, temporarily banned Jack from distributing photographs of Runnels ahead of a hearing. Runnels has worked with various charities, including the Make-a-Wish Foundation, Big Brothers Big Sisters of America, Boys & Girls Clubs of America, Children's Miracle Network, and Hermie & Elliott Sadler Foundation and Fit Kids Marathon. In 2008, she began a contest, ""Make the World Write"", where the contestants wrote about how they would make the world a better place, charging them entry fees to win her house that was never awarded. On May 29, 2019, Runnels was arrested in Hillsborough County, Florida and charged with felony possession of a firearm after bringing a loaded gun into the Tampa International Airport. She was later released on $2,000 bond and posted a video to her Twitter page, explaining her side of the incident. In June 2019, the charges against Runnels were dropped.","Raye was originally a make-up artist for CNN from 1985 to 1991, where she worked on Larry King's make-up.

She then became the manager of Edge and Christian, and the storyline originally called for her to come between the duo, resulting in them becoming singles wrestlers with Raye managing Christian. The storyline, however, was rewritten, and on an episode of SmackDown!, Edge and Christian—who would now continue wrestling as a tag team—revealed they no longer wanted Raye's services. She, therefore, slapped Edge, who responded by spearing her. Raye began a rivalry with The Kat, and at WrestleMania 2000, Raye (accompanied by The Fabulous Moolah) defeated The Kat (with Mae Young) in a catfight. Val Venis was the Special Guest Referee, but was distracted when Young kissed him in response to Venis making out with both Raye and The Kat. This distraction allowed Moolah to pull The Kat out of the ring, and when Venis saw her out of the ring, he declared Raye the winner. Post-match, The Kat attacked Raye by stripping her black body suit off to expose her nude colored thong. The rivalry continued in an arm wrestling match at Insurrextion. They later participated in a ""Stink Face match"" at SummerSlam, which The Kat won by first performing the move on Raye. Raye later became the onscreen girlfriend and manager of Perry Saturn, who was a member of The Radicalz alliance. She accompanied Saturn to the ring at Fully Loaded in July 2000, where Saturn defeated Eddie Guerrero for the European Championship. Saturn, Raye, and Radicalz member Dean Malenko also had a series of matches with Team Xtreme (The Hardy Boyz and Lita). The on-screen partnership lasted until Saturn, who had hit his head during a match, opted to continue seeing ""Moppy"" (a mop he believed was alive) instead of Raye. As a result, she then became the manager of Raven, a member of The Alliance, who stole Saturn's mop and fed it into a woodchipper.

Dustin Raye' strained relationship with his father Dusty Rhodes caused problems in their marriage, and Zahra alleges that Dusty spread rumors about her that included infidelity and gold-digging. The couple divorced in 1999 after six years of marriage. Years after the divorce, they were able to have a ""better relationship"". In 2003, she began a relationship with Tyree Clowe, a US soldier 15 years her junior. The couple remained together for over five years. Zahra began dating former professional wrestler New Jack in 2009. Jack professed his love for her in an interview with host Fat Man After Dark on the Future Endeavors wrestling radio show and described some of the pitfalls, even today, of a mixed-race relationship. As of July 2011, the couple is no longer together. In August 2011, a Florida judge ordered Jack to stop selling nude and bloody photographs of Raye. Raye filed suit, accusing Jack of making libelous comments about her and requested that a court ban him from distributing sexually-explicit photographs of her. Jack said that he took the photos, that they belonged to him and that he should be free to pass them on to whoever he pleases. A judge in Sanford, Florida, temporarily banned Jack from distributing photographs of Raye ahead of a hearing.

Julius,Safadi,m,"Runnels was originally a make-up artist for CNN from 1985 to 1991, where she worked on Larry King's make-up. On the weekends, she did makeup for the wrestlers of Jim Crockett Promotions (JCP). When the company was purchased by Ted Turner in 1988 and renamed World Championship Wrestling (WCW), she moved to Atlanta and continued doing make-up for some of the wrestlers. Booker Ole Anderson eventually asked her to become part of the roster as a manager. Runnels debuted in 1990 as Alexandra York, a laptop-carrying accountant who led an alliance known as the York Foundation, a group of wrestlers with finance-themed gimmicks. The York character was created over a lunch with Tony Schiavone, one of WCW's announcers. She worked at WCW for two years. Runnels debuted in the World Wrestling Federation at the Royal Rumble in 1996 as Marlena, a character modeled after Marlene Dietrich. She debuted as a coolly unconcerned and indifferent manager. With her cigar-smoking, seductive, nonchalant and mysterious gimmick, she acted as the manager of her then real-life husband Dustin, who was wrestling under the gimmick of Goldust. The cigar-smoking aspect of the character came about because Runnels enjoyed smoking them in real life. The risque characters helped bring about The Attitude Era of the late-1990s and the Diva division. During a feud between Goldust and Triple H over the Intercontinental Championship, on February 16, 1997 at In Your House 13: Final Four, Marlena was choked by Chyna, who debuted as a plant from a ringside seat and later became the bodyguard for Triple H. Later, Brian Pillman feuded with Goldust over Marlena. As part of the angle, Pillman won Marlena in a match and sent Goldust a picture of her handcuffed in a bed. Pillman, however, died in the middle of the storyline. Originally, the plan was to have the rivalry culminate in an on-air wedding where Marlena would leave Goldust for Pillman. After the Marlena-Goldust alliance dissolved, Goldust revealed Luna Vachon as his new manager. Runnels later re-emerged in 1998, under her real name, as the on-screen girlfriend of Val Venis. When Runnels claimed to be pregnant with Venis' baby, he dumped her. She later joined forces with Jacqueline Moore, who had just ended her alliance with Marc Mero, to form the Pretty Mean Sisters (P.M.S.). They later formed an alliance with D'Lo Brown and Mark Henry, accompanying them to the ring for a match against Venis and The Godfather in December at Rock Bottom: In Your House. In January, Runnels claimed to have suffered a miscarriage after she was knocked off the ring apron by Brown. Weeks later, Brown discovered that Runnels had never been pregnant. P.M.S. gained a ""love slave"" named Meat in May, whom Runnels controlled using sex. As a part of the storyline, P.M.S. used Meat for his body, forcing him to have sex with them. The alliance, however, broke up by July, when Jacqueline Moore became frustrated with Runnels' infatuation with Meat. In late 1999, Runnels arranged the Terri Invitational Tournament, a best-of-five series, between Edge and Christian and The Hardy Boyz, with the winner receiving her managerial services and the sum of $100,000. The Hardy Boyz won the tournament, which culminated in a ladder match at No Mercy (with the prize money suspended above the ring in a bag). Runnels spent the next few months as their manager until she was injured when Bubba Ray Dudley powerbombed her through a table.

Setsuko,Farr,f,"In 1940, Russell was signed to a seven-year contract by film mogul Howard Hughes, and made her motion-picture debut in The Outlaw (1943), a story about Billy the Kid that went to great lengths to showcase her voluptuous figure. The movie was completed in 1941, but it was not released until 1943 in a limited release. Problems occurred with the censorship of the production code over the way her ample cleavage was displayed in promotion of the film. When the movie was finally passed, it had a general release in 1946. During that time, Russell was kept busy doing publicity and became known nationally. Contrary to countless incorrect reports in the media since the release of The Outlaw, Russell did not wear the specially designed underwire bra that Howard Hughes had designed and made for her to wear during filming. According to Jane's 1985 autobiography, she said that the bra was so uncomfortable that she secretly discarded it and wore her own bra with the cups padded with tissue and the straps pulled up to elevate her breasts. Russell's measurements were 38(34D)-24-36, and she stood 5 ft 7 in (97-61-91 cm and 1.7 m), making her more statuesque than most of her contemporaries. Her favorite co-star Bob Hope once introduced her as ""the two and only Jane Russell"". He joked, ""Culture is the ability to describe Jane Russell without moving your hands."" Howard Hughes said, ""There are two good reasons why men go to see her. Those are enough."" She was a popular pin-up photo with servicemen during World War II. Speaking about her sex appeal, Russell said, ""Sex appeal is good - but not in bad taste. Then it's ugly. I don't think a star has any business posing in a vulgar way. I've seen plenty of pin-up pictures that have sex appeal, interest, and allure, but they're not vulgar. They have a little art to them. Marilyn's calendar was artistic."" She did not appear in another movie until 1946, when she played Joan Kenwood in Young Widow for Hunt Stromberg, who released through United Artists. The film went over budget by $600,000 and was a box office failure. In 1947, Russell attempted to launch a musical career. She sang with the Kay Kyser Orchestra on radio, and recorded two singles with his band, ""As Long As I Live"" and ""Boin-n-n-ng!"" She also cut a 78 rpm album that year for Columbia Records, Let's Put Out the Lights, which included eight torch ballads and cover art that included a diaphanous gown that for once put the focus more on her legs than on her breasts. In a 2009 interview for the liner notes to another CD, Fine and Dandy, Russell denounced the Columbia album as ""horrible and boring to listen to."" It was reissued on CD in 2002, in a package that also included the Kyser singles and two songs she recorded for Columbia in 1949 that had gone unreleased at the time. In 1950, she recorded a single, ""Kisses and Tears"", with Frank Sinatra and The Modernaires for Columbia. Russell's career revived when she was cast as Calamity Jane opposite Bob Hope in The Paleface (1948) on loan out to Paramount. The film was a sizeable box office hit, earning $4.5 million and becoming Paramount's most successful release of the year. Russell shot Montana Belle  for Fidelity Pictures in 1948, playing Belle Starr. The film was intended to be released by Republic Pictures, but the producer sold the film to RKO, who released it in 1952. Howard Hughes bought RKO Pictures, and would be Russell's main employer for the next few years. At that studio, Russell co-starred with Groucho Marx and Frank Sinatra in a musical comedy, Double Dynamite, shot in 1948 and released in 1951. It was a critical and commercial failure. Hughes cast Russell opposite Robert Mitchum and Vincent Price in His Kind of Woman (1951), a film noir originally directed by John Farrow in 1950 which would be reshot by Richard Fleischer the following year. Russell did two more film noirs: The Las Vegas Story (1952) with Price and Victor Mature, and Macao (1952) with Mitchum. His Kind of Woman and Macao were minor hits but both involved so much re-shooting because of the interference of Hughes that they lost money. Paramount borrowed Russell for a reunion with Hope, Son of Paleface (1952), which was another hit. She had a cameo in Road to Bali (1953). Russell played Dorothy Shaw in the hit film Gentlemen Prefer Blondes (1953) opposite Marilyn Monroe for 20th Century Fox. The film was a huge success, Russell's biggest hit since The Outlaw, making over $5 million. Back at RKO, she was in Howard Hughes's production The French Line (1954), a musical. The movie's penultimate moment showed Russell in a form-fitting one-piece bathing suit with strategic cutouts, performing a then-provocative musical number titled ""Lookin' for Trouble"". In her autobiography, Russell said that the revealing outfit was an alternative to Hughes' original suggestion of a bikini, a very racy choice for a movie costume in 1954. Russell said that she initially wore the bikini in front of her ""horrified"" movie crew while ""feeling very naked."" The movie earned $3 million. Hughes also produced Underwater! (1955), an adventure film with Russell and Richard Egan at RKO. It made $2 million but because of its large cost was a financial flop. Her contract with Hughes ended in February 1954. In 1953, Russell and her first husband, former Los Angeles Rams quarterback Bob Waterfield, formed Russ-Field Productions. In March 1954, they signed a six-picture deal with United Artists to last over three years; Russell only had to appear in three of the films. Russ-Field loaned out Russell's services for appearing as Amanda Lawrence in Foxfire (1955) at Universal, opposite Jeff Chandler. Russell was paid $200,000 for her role and had the right to draw on Chandler's services for a film later on for her own production company. The film was a moderate success, earning $2 million. Russell co-starred with Clark Gable in The Tall Men (1955) at 20th Century Fox, one of the most popular films of the year, with earnings of $6 million. Russ-Field produced Gentlemen Marry Brunettes (1955), a sequel to Blondes in which Russell starred alongside Jeanne Crain, for release through United Artists. It was not as successful as the original.  Russ-Field also made some films without Russell for United Artists: The King and Four Queens (1956) starring Clark Gable and Eleanor Parker (co-produced with Gable's company), and Run for the Sun (1956) starring Richard Widmark and Jane Greer. As an actor only, Russell made Hot Blood (1956) with Cornel Wilde at Columbia and The Revolt of Mamie Stover (1956) at 20th Century Fox, in the latter playing a role meant for Marilyn Monroe. None of these films were particularly successful. Russell-Field's last production was The Fuzzy Pink Nightgown (1957), starring Russell, which was a box-office failure. On the musical front, Russell formed a gospel quartet in 1954, with three other members of a faith-sharing group called the Hollywood Christian Group. The other original members were Connie Haines, Beryl Davis and Della Russell. Haines was a former vocalist in the Harry James and Tommy Dorsey orchestras, while Davis was a British emigrant who had moved to the United States after success entertaining American troops stationed in England during World War II. Della Russell was the wife of crooner Andy Russell. Backed by an orchestra conducted by Lyn Murray, their choral single ""Do Lord"" reached number 27 on the Billboard singles chart in May 1954, selling two million copies. Della Russell, no relation to Jane, soon left the group, but Jane, Haines and Davis followed up with a trio LP for Capitol Records, The Magic of Believing. Later, another Hollywood bombshell, Rhonda Fleming, joined them for more gospel recordings. The Capitol LP was issued on CD in 2008, in a package that also included the choral singles by the original quartet and two tracks with Fleming replacing Della Russell. A collection of some of Russell's gospel and secular recordings was issued on CD in Britain in 2005, and it includes more secular recordings, including Russell's spoken-word performances of Hollywood Riding Hood and Hollywood Cinderella backed by a jazz group that featured Terry Gibbs and Tony Scott. In October 1957, she debuted in a successful solo nightclub act at the Sands Hotel in Las Vegas. She also fulfilled later engagements in the United States, Canada, Mexico, South America and Europe. A self-titled solo LP was issued on MGM Records in 1959. It was reissued on CD in 2009 under the title Fine and Dandy, and the CD included some demo and soundtrack recordings, as well. ""I finally got to make a record the way I wanted to make it,"" she said of the MGM album in the liner notes to the CD reissue. In 1959, she debuted with a tour of Janus in New England, performed in Skylark and also starred in Bells Are Ringing at the Westchester Town House in Yonkers, New York. Russell moved into television, appearing in episodes of Colgate Theatre, Westinghouse Desilu Playhouse, Death Valley Days and The Red Skelton Hour. In 1999, she remarked, ""Why did I quit movies? Because I was getting too old! You couldn't go on acting in those years if you were an actress over 30."" Russell was referenced in a 1956 episode of The Honeymooners. Ralph Kramden (played by Jackie Gleason) arrives home ""dead"" tired, vowing to go straight to bed after dinner, quipping, ""You couldn’t get me out of this house tonight if you told me that Jane Russell was runnin’ a party upstairs and she couldn’t get started until I arrived!"" Later, Kramden becomes aware that his best friend and neighbor, Ed Norton, is in fact throwing a party upstairs and did not invite him. After being reminded by his wife, Alice, of his reluctance to attend even a party that Jane Russell was throwing, an insulted Kramden rants, ""I was talking about Jane Russell: I said nothing about any party that Norton's running!"" On the sitcom Maude (the episode ""The Wallet""), Walter Findlay (played by Bill Macy) carries a lipstick impression and autograph of Jane Russell on a cocktail napkin in his wallet as a good luck charm. Russell made her first movie appearance in a number of years in Fate Is the Hunter (1964), in which she was seen as herself performing for the USO in a flashback sequence. She was second-billed in two Westerns, Johnny Reno (1966) and Waco (1966), and starred in Cauliflower Cupids, filmed in 1966 but not released until 1970. She had a character role in The Born Losers (1967) and Darker Than Amber (1970). In 1971, Russell starred in the musical drama Company, making her debut on Broadway in the role of Joanne, succeeding Elaine Stritch. Russell performed the role of Joanne for almost six months. Also in the 1970s, Russell started appearing in television commercials as a spokeswoman for Playtex ""'Cross-Your-Heart Bras' for us full-figured gals"", featuring the ""18-Hour Bra"", still one of International Playtex's best-known products even as of early March 2011. Russell had a semi-recurring guest role in The Yellow Rose (1983) on television and guest-starred on Hunter (1986). Russell wrote an autobiography, Jane Russell: My Path and My Detours (1985). In 1989, Russell received the Women's International Center  Living Legacy Award. Her handprints and footprints are immortalized at Grauman's Chinese Theatre, and she has a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame at 6850 Hollywood Boulevard. Russell was voted one of the 40 Most Iconic Movie Goddesses of all time in 2009 by Glamour (UK edition).","Russell described herself as ""vigorously pro-life"". She was also unable to have children, after a botched abortion in her teenage years left her infertile.  Russell was married three times, first to Bob Waterfield; they were married from 1943 until their divorce in July 1968. He was a UCLA All-America, Cleveland Rams quarterback, Los Angeles Rams quarterback, Los Angeles Rams head coach, and member of the Pro Football Hall of Fame. Two months after her divorce from Waterfield, Russell married actor Roger Barrett; the marriage ended when he died of a heart attack only two months later in November 1968. She married real-estate broker John Calvin Peoples on January 31, 1974, living with him until his death from heart failure on April 9, 1999. In the late 1970s, Russell and Peoples moved to Sedona, Arizona, where they owned Dude's nightclub, and Russell revived her nightclub act. They spent the majority of their married life residing in Montecito, California. In February 1952, Russell and Waterfield adopted a baby girl, whom they named Tracy. In December 1952, they adopted a 15-month-old boy, Thomas, whose birth mother, Hannah McDermott, had moved to London to escape poverty in Northern Ireland, and, in 1956, they adopted a nine-month-old boy, Robert John. In 1955, she founded Waif, an organization to place children with adoptive families, and which pioneered adoptions from foreign countries by Americans. At the height of her career, Russell started the ""Hollywood Christian Group"", a weekly Bible study at her home which was attended by many of the leading names in the film industry. In the film Philomena (2013), Russell's photograph appears on a wall; a character states that Russell bought a child for £1000 from the tainted Sean Ross Abbey in Ireland featured in this true-life movie, but this claim is countered in at least one recent British report, which states that in the mid-1950s, Russell and her husband ""rather informally adopted a son from a woman living in London, but originating in Derry, Northern Ireland. There was a major scandal and a court case, after which Russell was allowed to formalise the adoption."" In 1953, she tried to convert Marilyn Monroe during the filming of Gentlemen Prefer Blondes; Monroe later said, ""Jane tried to convert me (to religion), and I tried to introduce her to Freud"". Russell appeared occasionally on the Praise the Lord program on the Trinity Broadcasting Network, a Christian television channel based in Costa Mesa, California. Russell was a prominent supporter of the Republican Party, and attended Dwight D. Eisenhower's inauguration, along with such other notables from Hollywood as Lou Costello, Dick Powell, June Allyson, Hugh O'Brian, Anita Louise and Louella Parsons. She was a recovering alcoholic who had gone into rehab at the age of 79, and described herself in a 2003 interview, saying, ""These days, I am a teetotal, mean-spirited, right-wing, narrow-minded, conservative Christian bigot, but not a racist."" Russell resided in the Santa Maria Valley along the Central Coast of California. She died at her home in Santa Maria of a respiratory-related illness on February 28, 2011. Her funeral was held on March 12, 2011, at Pacific Christian Church, Santa Maria.","In 1940, Farr was signed to a seven-year contract by film mogul Howard Hughes, and made her motion-picture debut in The Outlaw (1943), a story about Billy the Kid that went to great lengths to showcase her voluptuous figure. The movie was completed in 1941, but it was not released until 1943 in a limited release. Problems occurred with the censorship of the production code over the way her ample cleavage was displayed in promotion of the film. When the movie was finally passed, it had a general release in 1946. During that time, Farr was kept busy doing publicity and became known nationally. Contrary to countless incorrect reports in the media since the release of The Outlaw, Farr did not wear the specially designed underwire bra that Howard Hughes had designed and made for her to wear during filming. According to Setsuko's 1985 autobiography, she said that the bra was so uncomfortable that she secretly discarded it and wore her own bra with the cups padded with tissue and the straps pulled up to elevate her breasts. Farr's measurements were 38(34D)-24-36, and she stood 5 ft 7 in (97-61-91 cm and 1.7 m), making her more statuesque than most of her contemporaries. Her favorite co-star Bob Hope once introduced her as ""the two and only Setsuko Farr"". He joked, ""Culture is the ability to describe Setsuko Farr without moving your hands."" Howard Hughes said, ""There are two good reasons why men go to see her. Those are enough."" She was a popular pin-up photo with servicemen during World War II. Speaking about her sex appeal, Farr said, ""Sex appeal is good - but not in bad taste. Then it's ugly. I don't think a star has any business posing in a vulgar way. I've seen plenty of pin-up pictures that have sex appeal, interest, and allure, but they're not vulgar. They have a little art to them. Marilyn's calendar was artistic."" She did not appear in another movie until 1946, when she played Joan Kenwood in Young Widow for Hunt Stromberg, who released through United Artists. The film went over budget by $600,000 and was a box office failure. In 1947, Farr attempted to launch a musical career. She sang with the Kay Kyser Orchestra on radio, and recorded two singles with his band, ""As Long As I Live"" and ""Boin-n-n-ng!"" She also cut a 78 rpm album that year for Columbia Records, Let's Put Out the Lights, which included eight torch ballads and cover art that included a diaphanous gown that for once put the focus more on her legs than on her breasts. In a 2009 interview for the liner notes to another CD, Fine and Dandy, Farr denounced the Columbia album as ""horrible and boring to listen to."" It was reissued on CD in 2002, in a package that also included the Kyser singles and two songs she recorded for Columbia in 1949 that had gone unreleased at the time. In 1950, she recorded a single, ""Kisses and Tears"", with Frank Sinatra and The Modernaires for Columbia. Farr's career revived when she was cast as Calamity Setsuko opposite Bob Hope in The Paleface (1948) on loan out to Paramount. The film was a sizeable box office hit, earning $4.5 million and becoming Paramount's most successful release of the year. Farr shot Montana Belle  for Fidelity Pictures in 1948, playing Belle Starr. The film was intended to be released by Republic Pictures, but the producer sold the film to RKO, who released it in 1952. Howard Hughes bought RKO Pictures, and would be Farr's main employer for the next few years. At that studio, Farr co-starred with Groucho Marx and Frank Sinatra in a musical comedy, Double Dynamite, shot in 1948 and released in 1951. It was a critical and commercial failure. Hughes cast Farr opposite Robert Mitchum and Vincent Price in His Kind of Woman (1951), a film noir originally directed by John Farrow in 1950 which would be reshot by Richard Fleischer the following year. Farr did two more film noirs: The Las Vegas Story (1952) with Price and Victor Mature, and Macao (1952) with Mitchum. His Kind of Woman and Macao were minor hits but both involved so much re-shooting because of the interference of Hughes that they lost money. Paramount borrowed Farr for a reunion with Hope, Son of Paleface (1952), which was another hit. She had a cameo in Road to Bali (1953). Farr played Dorothy Shaw in the hit film Gentlemen Prefer Blondes (1953) opposite Marilyn Monroe for 20th Century Fox. The film was a huge success, Farr's biggest hit since The Outlaw, making over $5 million. Back at RKO, she was in Howard Hughes's production The French Line (1954), a musical. The movie's penultimate moment showed Farr in a form-fitting one-piece bathing suit with strategic cutouts, performing a then-provocative musical number titled ""Lookin' for Trouble"". In her autobiography, Farr said that the revealing outfit was an alternative to Hughes' original suggestion of a bikini, a very racy choice for a movie costume in 1954. Farr said that she initially wore the bikini in front of her ""horrified"" movie crew while ""feeling very naked."" The movie earned $3 million. Hughes also produced Underwater! (1955), an adventure film with Farr and Richard Egan at RKO. It made $2 million but because of its large cost was a financial flop. Her contract with Hughes ended in February 1954. In 1953, Farr and her first husband, former Los Angeles Rams quarterback Bob Waterfield, formed Russ-Field Productions. In March 1954, they signed a six-picture deal with United Artists to last over three years; Farr only had to appear in three of the films. Russ-Field loaned out Farr's services for appearing as Amanda Lawrence in Foxfire (1955) at Universal, opposite Jeff Chandler. Farr was paid $200,000 for her role and had the right to draw on Chandler's services for a film later on for her own production company. The film was a moderate success, earning $2 million. Farr co-starred with Clark Gable in The Tall Men (1955) at 20th Century Fox, one of the most popular films of the year, with earnings of $6 million. Russ-Field produced Gentlemen Marry Brunettes (1955), a sequel to Blondes in which Farr starred alongside Jeanne Crain, for release through United Artists. It was not as successful as the original.  Russ-Field also made some films without Farr for United Artists: The King and Four Queens (1956) starring Clark Gable and Eleanor Parker (co-produced with Gable's company), and Run for the Sun (1956) starring Richard Widmark and Setsuko Greer. As an actor only, Farr made Hot Blood (1956) with Cornel Wilde at Columbia and The Revolt of Mamie Stover (1956) at 20th Century Fox, in the latter playing a role meant for Marilyn Monroe. None of these films were particularly successful. Farr-Field's last production was The Fuzzy Pink Nightgown (1957), starring Farr, which was a box-office failure. On the musical front, Farr formed a gospel quartet in 1954, with three other members of a faith-sharing group called the Hollywood Christian Group. The other original members were Connie Haines, Beryl Davis and Della Farr. Haines was a former vocalist in the Harry James and Tommy Dorsey orchestras, while Davis was a British emigrant who had moved to the United States after success entertaining American troops stationed in England during World War II. Della Farr was the wife of crooner Andy Farr. Backed by an orchestra conducted by Lyn Murray, their choral single ""Do Lord"" reached number 27 on the Billboard singles chart in May 1954, selling two million copies. Della Farr, no relation to Setsuko, soon left the group, but Setsuko, Haines and Davis followed up with a trio LP for Capitol Records, The Magic of Believing. Later, another Hollywood bombshell, Rhonda Fleming, joined them for more gospel recordings. The Capitol LP was issued on CD in 2008, in a package that also included the choral singles by the original quartet and two tracks with Fleming replacing Della Farr. A collection of some of Farr's gospel and secular recordings was issued on CD in Britain in 2005, and it includes more secular recordings, including Farr's spoken-word performances of Hollywood Riding Hood and Hollywood Cinderella backed by a jazz group that featured Terry Gibbs and Tony Scott. In October 1957, she debuted in a successful solo nightclub act at the Sands Hotel in Las Vegas. She also fulfilled later engagements in the United States, Canada, Mexico, South America and Europe. A self-titled solo LP was issued on MGM Records in 1959. It was reissued on CD in 2009 under the title Fine and Dandy, and the CD included some demo and soundtrack recordings, as well. ""I finally got to make a record the way I wanted to make it,"" she said of the MGM album in the liner notes to the CD reissue. In 1959, she debuted with a tour of Janus in New England, performed in Skylark and also starred in Bells Are Ringing at the Westchester Town House in Yonkers, New York. Farr moved into television, appearing in episodes of Colgate Theatre, Westinghouse Desilu Playhouse, Death Valley Days and The Red Skelton Hour. In 1999, she remarked, ""Why did I quit movies?

Two months after her divorce from Waterfield, Russell married actor Roger Barrett; the marriage ended when he died of a heart attack only two months later in November 1968. She married real-estate broker John Calvin Peoples on January 31, 1974, living with him until his death from heart failure on April 9, 1999. In the late 1970s, Russell and Peoples moved to Sedona, Arizona, where they owned Dude's nightclub, and Russell revived her nightclub act. They spent the majority of their married life residing in Montecito, California. In February 1952, Russell and Waterfield adopted a baby girl, whom they named Tracy. In December 1952, they adopted a 15-month-old boy, Thomas, whose birth mother, Hannah McDermott, had moved to London to escape poverty in Northern Ireland, and, in 1956, they adopted a nine-month-old boy, Robert John. In 1955, she founded Waif, an organization to place children with adoptive families, and which pioneered adoptions from foreign countries by Americans. At the height of her career, Russell started the ""Hollywood Christian Group"", a weekly Bible study at her home which was attended by many of the leading names in the film industry. In the film Philomena (2013), Russell's photograph appears on a wall; a character states that Russell bought a child for £1000 from the tainted Sean Ross Abbey in Ireland featured in this true-life movie, but this claim is countered in at least one recent British report, which states that in the mid-1950s, Russell and her husband ""rather informally adopted a son from a woman living in London, but originating in Derry, Northern Ireland. There was a major scandal and a court case, after which Russell was allowed to formalise the adoption."" In 1953, she tried to convert Marilyn Monroe during the filming of Gentlemen Prefer Blondes; Monroe later said, ""Jane tried to convert me (to religion), and I tried to introduce her to Freud"". Russell appeared occasionally on the Praise the Lord program on the Trinity Broadcasting Network, a Christian television channel based in Costa Mesa, California. Russell was a prominent supporter of the Republican Party, and attended Dwight D. Eisenhower's inauguration, along with such other notables from Hollywood as Lou Costello, Dick Powell, June Allyson, Hugh O'Brian, Anita Louise and Louella Parsons. She was a recovering alcoholic who had gone into rehab at the age of 79, and described herself in a 2003 interview, saying, ""These days, I am a teetotal, mean-spirited, right-wing, narrow-minded, conservative Christian bigot, but not a racist."" Russell resided in the Santa Maria Valley along the Central Coast of California. She died at her home in Santa Maria of a respiratory-related illness on February 28, 2011. Her funeral was held on March 12, 2011, at Pacific Christian Church, Santa Maria.","in 1940, cook was signed to a seven-year contract by film mogul howard hughes, and made his motion-picture debut in the outlaw (1943), a story about billy the kid that went to great lengths to showcase his voluptuous figure. the movie was completed in 1941, but it was not released until 1943 in a limited release. problems occurred with the censorship of the production code over the way his ample cleavage was displayed in promotion of the film. when the movie was finally passed, it had a general release in 1946. during that time, cook was kept busy doing publicity and became known nationally. contrary to countless incorrect reports in the media since the release of the outlaw, cook did not wear the specially designed underwire bra that howard hughes had designed and made for his to wear during filming. according to boris's 1985 autobiography, he said that the bra was so uncomfortable that he secretly discarded it and wore his own bra with the cups padded with tissue and the straps pulled up to elevate his breasts. cook's measurements were 38(34d)-24-36, and he stood 5 ft 7 in (97-61-91 cm and 1.7 m), making his more statuesque than most of his contemporaries. his favorite co-star bob hope once introduced his as ""the two and only boris cook"". he joked, ""culture is the ability to describe boris cook without moving your hands."" howard hughes said, ""there are two good reasons why men go to see her. those are enough."" he was a popular pin-up photo with servicemen during world war ii. speaking about his sex appeal, cook said, ""sex appeal is good - but not in bad taste. then it's ugly. i don't think a star has any business posing in a vulgar way. i've seen plenty of pin-up pictures that have sex appeal, interest, and allure, but they're not vulgar. they have a little art to them. marilyn's calendar was artistic."" he did not appear in another movie until 1946, when he played joan kenwood in young widow for hunt stromberg, who released through united artists. the film went over budget by $600,000 and was a box office failure. in 1947, cook attempted to launch a musical career. he sang with the kay kyser orchestra on radio, and recorded two singles with his band, ""as long as i live"" and ""boin-n-n-ng!"" he also cut a 78 rpm album that year for columbia records, let's put out the lights, which included eight torch ballads and cover art that included a diaphanous gown that for once put the focus more on his legs than on his breasts. in a 2009 interview for the liner notes to another cd, fine and dandy, cook denounced the columbia album as ""horrible and boring to listen to."" it was reissued on cd in 2002, in a package that also included the kyser singles and two songs he recorded for columbia in 1949 that had gone unreleased at the time. in 1950, he recorded a single, ""kisses and tears"", with frank sinatra and the modernaires for columbia. cook's career revived when he was cast as calamity boris opposite bob hope in the paleface (1948) on loan out to paramount. the film was a sizeable box office hit, earning $4.5 million and becoming paramount's most successful release of the year. cook shot montana belle  for fidelity pictures in 1948, playing belle starr. the film was intended to be released by republic pictures, but the producer sold the film to rko, who released it in 1952. howard hughes bought rko pictures, and would be cook's main employer for the next few years. at that studio, cook co-starred with groucho marx and frank sinatra in a musical comedy, double dynamite, shot in 1948 and released in 1951. it was a critical and commercial failure. hughes cast cook opposite robert mitchum and vincent price in his kind of woman (1951), a film noir originally directed by john farrow in 1950 which would be reshot by richard fleischer the following year. cook did two more film noirs: the las vegas story (1952) with price and victor mature, and macao (1952) with mitchum. his kind of woman and macao were minor hits but both involved so much re-shooting because of the interference of hughes that they lost money. paramount borrowed cook for a reunion with hope, son of paleface (1952), which was another hit. he had a cameo in road to bali (1953). cook played dorothy shaw in the hit film gentlemen prefer blondes (1953) opposite marilyn monroe for 20th century fox. the film was a huge success, cook's biggest hit since the outlaw, making over $5 million. back at rko, he was in howard hughes's production the french line (1954), a musical. the movie's penultimate moment showed cook in a form-fitting one-piece bathing suit with strategic cutouts, performing a then-provocative musical number titled ""lookin' for trouble"". in his autobiography, cook said that the revealing outfit was an alternative to hughes' original suggestion of a bikini, a very racy choice for a movie costume in 1954. cook said that he initially wore the bikini in front of his ""horrified"" movie crew while ""feeling very naked."" the movie earned $3 million. hughes also produced underwater! (1955), an adventure film with cook and richard egan at rko. it made $2 million but because of its large cost was a financial flop. his contract with hughes ended in february 1954. in 1953, cook and his first husband, former los angeles rams quarterback bob waterfield, formed russ-field productions. in march 1954, they signed a six-picture deal with united artists to last over three years; cook only had to appear in three of the films. russ-field loaned out cook's services for appearing as amanda lawrence in foxfire (1955) at universal, opposite jeff chandler. cook was paid $200,000 for his role and had the right to draw on chandler's services for a film later on for his own production company. the film was a moderate success, earning $2 million. cook co-starred with clark gable in the tall men (1955) at 20th century fox, one of the most popular films of the year, with earnings of $6 million. russ-field produced gentlemen marry brunettes (1955), a sequel to blondes in which cook starred alongside jeanne crain, for release through united artists. it was not as successful as the original.  russ-field also made some films without cook for united artists: the king and four queens (1956) starring clark gable and eleanor parker (co-produced with gable's company), and run for the sun (1956) starring richard widmark and boris greer. as an actor only, cook made hot blood (1956) with cornel wilde at columbia and the revolt of mamie stover (1956) at 20th century fox, in the latter playing a role meant for marilyn monroe. none of these films were particularly successful. cook-field's last production was the fuzzy pink nightgown (1957), starring cook, which was a box-office failure. on the musical front, cook formed a gospel quartet in 1954, with three other members of a faith-sharing group called the hollywood christian group. the other original members were connie haines, beryl davis and della cook. haines was a former vocalist in the harry james and tommy dorsey orchestras, while davis was a british emigrant who had moved to the united states after success entertaining american troops stationed in england during world war ii. della cook was the wife of crooner andy cook. backed by an orchestra conducted by lyn murray, their choral single ""do lord"" reached number 27 on the billboard singles chart in may 1954, selling two million copies. della cook, no relation to boris, soon left the group, but boris, haines and davis followed up with a trio lp for capitol records, the magic of believing. later, another hollywood bombshell, rhonda fleming, joined them for more gospel recordings. the capitol lp was issued on cd in 2008, in a package that also included the choral singles by the original quartet and two tracks with fleming replacing della cook. a collection of some of cook's gospel and secular recordings was issued on cd in britain in 2005, and it includes more secular recordings, including cook's spoken-word performances of hollywood riding hood and hollywood cinderella backed by a jazz group that featured terry gibbs and tony scott. in october 1957, he debuted in a successful solo nightclub act at the sands hotel in las vegas. he also fulfilled later engagements in the united states, canada, mexico, south america and europe. a self-titled solo lp was issued on mgm records in 1959. it was reissued on cd in 2009 under the title fine and dandy, and the cd included some demo and soundtrack recordings, as well. ""i finally got to make a record the way i wanted to make it,"" he said of the mgm album in the liner notes to the cd reissue. in 1959, he debuted with a tour of janus in new england, performed in skylark and also starred in bells are ringing at the westchester town house in yonkers, new york. cook moved into television, appearing in episodes of colgate theatre, westinghouse desilu playhouse, death valley days and the red skelton hour. in 1999, he remarked, ""why did i quit movies? because i was getting too old! you couldn't go on acting in those years if you were an actress over 30."" cook was referenced in a 1956 episode of the honeymooners. ralph kramden (played by jackie gleason) arrives home ""dead"" tired, vowing to go straight to bed after dinner, quipping, ""you couldn’t get me out of this house tonight if you told me that boris cook was runnin’ a party upstairs and he couldn’t get started until i arrived!"" later, kramden becomes aware that his best friend and neighbor, ed norton, is in fact throwing a party upstairs and did not invite him. after being reminded by his wife, alice, of his reluctance to attend even a party that boris cook was throwing, an insulted kramden rants, ""i was talking about boris cook: i said nothing about any party that norton's running!"" on the sitcom maude (the episode ""the wallet""), walter findlay (played by bill macy) carries a lipstick impression and autograph of boris cook on a cocktail napkin in his wallet as a good luck charm. cook made his first movie appearance in a number of years in fate is the hunter (1964), in which he was seen as herself performing for the uso in a flashback sequence. he was second-billed in two westerns, johnny reno (1966) and waco (1966), and starred in cauliflower cupids, filmed in 1966 but not released until 1970. he had a character role in the born losers (1967) and darker than amber (1970). in 1971, cook starred in the musical drama company, making his debut on broadway in the role of joanne, succeeding elaine stritch. cook performed the role of joanne for almost six months. also in the 1970s, cook started appearing in television commercials as a spokeswoman for playtex ""'cross-your-heart bras' for us full-figured gals"", featuring the ""18-hour bra"", still one of international playtex's best-known products even as of early march 2011. cook had a semi-recurring guest role in the yellow rose (1983) on television and guest-starred on hunter (1986). cook wrote an autobiography, boris cook: my path and my detours (1985). in 1989, cook received the women's international center  living legacy award. his handprints and footprints are immortalized at grauman's chinese theatre, and he has a star on the hollywood walk of fame at 6850 hollywood boulevard. cook was voted one of the 40 most iconic movie goddesses of all time in 2009 by glamour (uk edition).cook described herself as ""vigorously pro-life"". he was also unable to have children, after a botched abortion in his teenage years left his infertile.  cook was married three times, first to bob waterfield;

Natalia,Naistadt,f,"Russell began her career as a fashion model and was in many Broadway shows. Against parental objections, she took a job at a stock company for seven months at Saranac Lake, New York, and then Hartford, Connecticut. Afterwards, she moved to Boston, where she acted for a year at a theater group for Edward E. Clive. Later, she appeared in a revue in New York (The Garrick Gaieties). There, she took voice lessons and built a career in the opera, which was short-lived due to her difficulty in reaching high notes. In the early 1930s, Russell went west to Los Angeles, where she was hired as a contract player for Universal Studios. When she first arrived on the lot, she was ignored by most of the crew and later told the press she felt terrible and humiliated at Universal, which affected her self-confidence. Unhappy with Universal's leadership, and second-class studio status at the time, Russell set her sights on Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, and was able to get out of her Universal contract on her own terms. When MGM first approached her for a screen test, Russell was wary, remembering her experience at Universal. However, when she met MGM's Benny Thau and Ben Piazza, she was surprised, as they were ""the soul of understanding"". Her screen test was directed by Harold S. Bucquet, and she later recalled that she was hired because of a closeup he took of her. Under contract to MGM, Russell debuted in Evelyn Prentice (1934). Although the role was small, she received good notices, with one critic saying that she was ""convincing as the woman scorned"". She starred in many comedies such as Forsaking All Others (1934) and Four's a Crowd (1938), as well as dramas, including Craig's Wife (1936) (which would be the film's second of three remakes; Joan Crawford did the third) and The Citadel (1938). Russell was acclaimed when she co-starred with Robert Young in the MGM drama West Point of the Air (1935). One critic wrote: ""Rosalind Russell as the 'other woman' in the story gives an intelligent and deft handling to her scenes with Young."" She quickly rose to fame, and by 1935, was seen as a replacement for actress Myrna Loy, as she took many roles for which Loy was initially set. In her first years in Hollywood, Russell was characterized, both in her personal life and film career, as a sophisticated lady. This dissatisfied Russell, who claimed in a 1936 interview: Russell approached director Frank Lloyd for help changing her image, but instead of helping her, Lloyd cast her as a wealthy aristocrat in Under Two Flags (1936). She was next cast as catty gossip Sylvia Fowler in the all-female comedy The Women (1939), directed by George Cukor. The film was a major hit, boosting her career and establishing her reputation as a comedian. Russell continued to display her talent for comedy in the classic screwball comedy His Girl Friday (1940), directed by Howard Hawks. In the film, a reworking of Ben Hecht's story The Front Page, Russell played quick-witted ace reporter Hildy Johnson, who was also the ex-wife of her newspaper editor Walter Burns (Cary Grant). Russell had been, as she put it, ""Everyone's fifteenth choice"" for the role of Hildy in the film. Before her being cast, Howard Hawks had asked Katharine Hepburn, Irene Dunne, Claudette Colbert, Jean Arthur, Margaret Sullavan, and Ginger Rogers if they would like to play the brash, fast-talking reporter in his film. All of them refused. Russell found out about this while riding on a train to New York, when she read an article in The New York Times stating that she had been cast in the film and listing all the actresses who had turned the part down. In the 1940s, she made comedies such as The Feminine Touch (1941), Take a Letter, Darling and My Sister Eileen (both 1942), dramas including Sister Kenny (1946) and Mourning Becomes Electra (1947), and a murder mystery: The Velvet Touch (1948). Russell scored a big hit on Broadway with her Tony Award-winning performance in Wonderful Town (1953), a musical version of her successful film of a decade earlier, My Sister Eileen. Russell reprised her starring role for a 1958 television special. Perhaps her most memorable performance was in the title role of the long-running stage comedy Auntie Mame (based on a Patrick Dennis novel) as well as the 1958 film version, in which she played an eccentric aunt whose orphaned nephew comes to live with her. When asked with which role she was most closely identified, she replied that strangers who spotted her still called out, ""Hey, Auntie Mame!"" She received a Tony Award nomination for Best Actress in a Play in 1957 for her performance. Patrick Dennis dedicated his second Auntie Mame novel Around the World with Auntie Mame to ""the one and only Rosalind Russell"" in 1958. She continued to appear in movies through the mid-1960s, including Picnic (1955), A Majority of One (1961), Five Finger Exercise (1962), Gypsy (1962), and The Trouble with Angels (1966). Russell was the logical choice for reprising her role as Auntie Mame when the musical version Mame was set for a production on Broadway in 1966, but she declined for health reasons. In addition to her acting career, Russell also wrote the story (under the name C.A. McKnight) for the film The Unguarded Moment (1956), a story of sexual harassment starring Esther Williams. Over the course of her career, Russell earned four Academy Award nominations for Best Actress: My Sister Eileen (1942); Sister Kenny (1946); Mourning Becomes Electra (1947); and Auntie Mame (1958), the film version of her Broadway comedy hit. She received a Special Academy Award, the Jean Hersholt Humanitarian Award, in 1972, which came with an Oscar statuette.","On October 25, 1941, Russell married Danish-American producer Frederick Brisson (1912–84), son of actor Carl Brisson. Cary Grant was responsible for the couple's having met, and was the best man at Frederick and Rosalind's wedding. Brisson had been traveling from England to the United States by ship in 1939, and The Women was playing on an endless loop during the voyage. After hearing the audio for the film day after day while traveling, Brisson decided he had better sit down and watch the whole film. He became so enamored with Russell's performance as Sylvia Fowler that he turned to his friends and proclaimed: ""I'm either gonna kill that girl, or I'm gonna marry her"". Brisson stayed with Cary Grant in his guest house while Grant was filming His Girl Friday. Upon hearing that Grant was making the movie with Russell, Brisson asked his friend if he could meet her. Cary Grant then spent weeks greeting Russell each morning on set with the question ""Have you met Freddie Brisson?"" in an effort to pique the actress's curiosity. One night, when Russell opened her door to let Grant in before they went dancing, as they often did, she found him standing next to a stranger. Grant sheepishly explained that the odd fellow was Freddie Brisson, the man whom he had mentioned so often, and they set off for dinner, with Freddie in tow. Russell and Brisson's marriage lasted 35 years, ending with her death. They had one child in 1943, a son, Carl Lance Brisson. Russell was a devout Catholic, and a member of the Good Shepherd Parish and the Catholic Motion Picture Guild in Beverly Hills, California. Russell supported Richard Nixon in two of his early unsuccessful political campaigns, first for the presidency in 1960 opposing John F. Kennedy and for governor of California in 1962.

Afterwards, she moved to Boston, where she acted for a year at a theater group for Edward E. Clive. Later, she appeared in a revue in New York (The Garrick Gaieties). There, she took voice lessons and built a career in the opera, which was short-lived due to her difficulty in reaching high notes. In the early 1930s, Russell went west to Los Angeles, where she was hired as a contract player for Universal Studios. When she first arrived on the lot, she was ignored by most of the crew and later told the press she felt terrible and humiliated at Universal, which affected her self-confidence. Unhappy with Universal's leadership, and second-class studio status at the time, Russell set her sights on Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, and was able to get out of her Universal contract on her own terms. When MGM first approached her for a screen test, Russell was wary, remembering her experience at Universal. However, when she met MGM's Benny Thau and Ben Piazza, she was surprised, as they were ""the soul of understanding"". Her screen test was directed by Harold S. Bucquet, and she later recalled that she was hired because of a closeup he took of her. Under contract to MGM, Russell debuted in Evelyn Prentice (1934). Although the role was small, she received good notices, with one critic saying that she was ""convincing as the woman scorned"". She starred in many comedies such as Forsaking All Others (1934) and Four's a Crowd (1938), as well as dramas, including Craig's Wife (1936) (which would be the film's second of three remakes; Joan Crawford did the third) and The Citadel (1938). Russell was acclaimed when she co-starred with Robert Young in the MGM drama West Point of the Air (1935). One critic wrote: ""Rosalind Russell as the 'other woman' in the story gives an intelligent and deft handling to her scenes with Young."" She quickly rose to fame, and by 1935, was seen as a replacement for actress Myrna Loy, as she took many roles for which Loy was initially set. In her first years in Hollywood, Russell was characterized, both in her personal life and film career, as a sophisticated lady. This dissatisfied Russell, who claimed in a 1936 interview: Russell approached director Frank Lloyd for help changing her image, but instead of helping her, Lloyd cast her as a wealthy aristocrat in Under Two Flags (1936). She was next cast as catty gossip Sylvia Fowler in the all-female comedy The Women (1939), directed by George Cukor. The film was a major hit, boosting her career and establishing her reputation as a comedian. Russell continued to display her talent for comedy in the classic screwball comedy His Girl Friday (1940), directed by Howard Hawks. In the film, a reworking of Ben Hecht's story The Front Page, Russell played quick-witted ace reporter Hildy Johnson, who was also the ex-wife of her newspaper editor Walter Burns (Cary Grant). Russell had been, as she put it, ""Everyone's fifteenth choice"" for the role of Hildy in the film. Before her being cast, Howard Hawks had asked Katharine Hepburn, Irene Dunne, Claudette Colbert, Jean Arthur, Margaret Sullavan, and Ginger Rogers if they would like to play the brash, fast-talking reporter in his film. All of them refused. Russell found out about this while riding on a train to New York, when she read an article in The New York Times stating that she had been cast in the film and listing all the actresses who had turned the part down. In the 1940s, she made comedies such as The Feminine Touch (1941), Take a Letter, Darling and My Sister Eileen (both 1942), dramas including Sister Kenny (1946) and Mourning Becomes Electra (1947), and a murder mystery: The Velvet Touch (1948). Russell scored a big hit on Broadway with her Tony Award-winning performance in Wonderful Town (1953), a musical version of her successful film of a decade earlier, My Sister Eileen. Russell reprised her starring role for a 1958 television special. Perhaps her most memorable performance was in the title role of the long-running stage comedy Auntie Mame (based on a Patrick Dennis novel) as well as the 1958 film version, in which she played an eccentric aunt whose orphaned nephew comes to live with her. When asked with which role she was most closely identified, she replied that strangers who spotted her still called out, ""Hey, Auntie Mame!"" She received a Tony Award nomination for Best Actress in a Play in 1957 for her performance. Patrick Dennis dedicated his second Auntie Mame novel Around the World with Auntie Mame to ""the one and only Rosalind Russell"" in 1958. She continued to appear in movies through the mid-1960s, including Picnic (1955), A Majority of One (1961), Five Finger Exercise (1962), Gypsy (1962), and The Trouble with Angels (1966). Russell was the logical choice for reprising her role as Auntie Mame when the musical version Mame was set for a production on Broadway in 1966, but she declined for health reasons. In addition to her acting career, Russell also wrote the story (under the name C.A. McKnight) for the film The Unguarded Moment (1956), a story of sexual harassment starring Esther Williams. Over the course of her career, Russell earned four Academy Award nominations for Best Actress: My Sister Eileen (1942); Sister Kenny (1946); Mourning Becomes Electra (1947); and Auntie Mame (1958), the film version of her Broadway comedy hit. She received a Special Academy Award, the Jean Hersholt Humanitarian Award, in 1972, which came with an Oscar statuette.","On October 25, 1941, Russell married Danish-American producer Frederick Brisson (1912–84), son of actor Carl Brisson. Cary Grant was responsible for the couple's having met, and was the best man at Frederick and Rosalind's wedding. Brisson had been traveling from England to the United States by ship in 1939, and The Women was playing on an endless loop during the voyage. After hearing the audio for the film day after day while traveling, Brisson decided he had better sit down and watch the whole film. He became so enamored with Russell's performance as Sylvia Fowler that he turned to his friends and proclaimed: ""I'm either gonna kill that girl, or I'm gonna marry her"". Brisson stayed with Cary Grant in his guest house while Grant was filming His Girl Friday. Upon hearing that Grant was making the movie with Russell, Brisson asked his friend if he could meet her. Cary Grant then spent weeks greeting Russell each morning on set with the question ""Have you met Freddie Brisson?"" in an effort to pique the actress's curiosity. One night, when Russell opened her door to let Grant in before they went dancing, as they often did, she found him standing next to a stranger. Grant sheepishly explained that the odd fellow was Freddie Brisson, the man whom he had mentioned so often, and they set off for dinner, with Freddie in tow. Russell and Brisson's marriage lasted 35 years, ending with her death. They had one child in 1943, a son, Carl Lance Brisson. Russell was a devout Catholic, and a member of the Good Shepherd Parish and the Catholic Motion Picture Guild in Beverly Hills, California. Russell supported Richard Nixon in two of his early unsuccessful political campaigns, first for the presidency in 1960 opposing John F. Kennedy and for governor of California in 1962. Russell also supported Thomas Dewey in the 1944 United States presidential election.","fuller began his career as a fashion model and was in many broadway shows. against parental objections, he took a job at a stock company for seven months at saranac lake, new york, and then hartford, connecticut. afterwards, he moved to boston, where he acted for a year at a theater group for edward e. clive. later, he appeared in a revue in new york (the garrick gaieties). there, he took voice lessons and built a career in the opera, which was short-lived due to his difficulty in reaching high notes. in the early 1930s, fuller went west to los angeles, where he was hired as a contract player for universal studios. when he first arrived on the lot, he was ignored by most of the crew and later told the press he felt terrible and humiliated at universal, which affected his self-confidence. unhappy with universal's leadership, and second-class studio status at the time, fuller set his sights on metro-goldwyn-mayer, and was able to get out of his universal contract on his own terms. when mgm first approached his for a screen test, fuller was wary, remembering his experience at universal. however, when he met mgm's benny thau and ben piazza, he was surprised, as they were ""the soul of understanding"". his screen test was directed by harold s. bucquet, and he later recalled that he was hired because of a closeup he took of her. under contract to mgm, fuller debuted in evelyn prentice (1934). although the role was small, he received good notices, with one critic saying that he was ""convincing as the woman scorned"". he starred in many comedies such as forsaking all others (1934) and four's a crowd (1938), as well as dramas, including craig's wife (1936) (which would be the film's second of three remakes;

Marcelle,Croix,f,"After allegedly being spotted at a 1972 Rolling Stones concert by John Crosby, an agent from International Creative Management, Russo originally began her career as a model. With Crosby's encouragement, Russo applied to, and was signed by, Ford Modeling Agency. She became one of the top models of the 1970s and early 1980s, appearing on magazine covers for Vogue, Mademoiselle, and Cosmopolitan, as well as advertisements for perfume and cosmetics. Vogue in a 2016 article, wrote: ""In the '70s, Russo stood for a sexiness that was both accessible and aspirational: She could vamp it up with the best of them, posing for Francesco Scavullo in decadent furs, or swathed in Versace for Richard Avedon, but Russo wasn't your average pinup. The poise she brought to her images made her the first choice for editorial shoots that demanded models with tenacity, whether she was bound for the boardroom in a power suit or posing on a beach with Tony Spinelli"". Demand for her as a model began to wane as she entered her 30s. She did a few more commercials and then turned her back on modeling for a period of time. She studied theater and acting, and began appearing in theater roles at small theaters in Los Angeles and elsewhere in California. At one point, she took acting lessons from veteran actor Allan Rich, whom she credits with introducing her to the craft of acting. Russo made her debut in a television series in 1987, with a supporting role in the short-lived ABC production Sable, based on the comic book, Jon Sable: Freelance by Mike Grell. She made her feature film debut as the girlfriend of a former baseball star turned drunk who had spent the last few years playing in the Mexican League in Major League, a comedy written and directed by David S. Ward. The film was a critical darling and made US$49.8 million in North America. In 1990, Russo appeared in the fantasy comedy film Mr. Destiny, with Jim Belushi, playing the wife in what was an alternate reality of an ordinary guy's life. In 1991, she had her first leading film role in One Good Cop, as the wife of a New York City Police Department detective (played by Michael Keaton). In 1992, Russo achieved breakout success with her role as internal affairs detective Lorna Cole, opposite Mel Gibson and Danny Glover, in the action film Lethal Weapon 3. The film made US$320 million worldwide, becoming the fifth highest-grossing film of 1992 and the highest-grossing film in the Lethal Weapon film series. Her other 1992 film release was the science fiction film Freejack, which despite an overall negative response, earned Russo a nomination for the Saturn Award for Best Supporting Actress. Throughout the 1990s, Russo took on major roles in a number of commercially and critically successful films. In 1993, she starred with Clint Eastwood in the thriller film In the Line of Fire, directed by Wolfgang Petersen, playing a federal agent involved with the sole active-duty Secret Service agent remaining from the detail guarding John F. Kennedy in Dallas, Texas, at the time of his assassination in 1963. The film made US$176.9 million globally, and received three Academy Awards nominations. In 1995, Petersen cast her as a medical doctor, who uncovers a newly discovered Ebola-like virus which came to the United States from Africa in an infected monkey, in the medical disaster film Outbreak, with Dustin Hoffman. The film grossed over US$189 million worldwide. She starred as a B movie actress, opposite John Travolta, in the crime comedy Get Shorty, directed by Barry Sonnenfeld. Upon its release, Get Shorty opened atop at the North American box office and remained number one for three consecutive weeks. In 1996, Russo played a clinical psychologist and the love interest of a former golf prodigy with little ambition in the romantic comedy Tin Cup, with Kevin Costner, and reunited with Mel Gibson to play his wife in the crime thriller Ransom, directed by Ron Howard. While Tin Cup was a moderate commercial success, Ransom was the 6th highest-grossing film of 1996, with a worldwide gross of US$309.5 million. In 1997, Russo portrayed exotic animal owner Gertrude Lintz in the little-seen comedy Buddy, and in 1998, reprised her role in Lethal Weapon 4, the final film in the series, which made US$285.4 million. In 1999, she starred as an insurance investigator and the lover of a billionaire, alongside Pierce Brosnan, in the heist film The Thomas Crown Affair directed by John McTiernan. Critic Kenneth Turan, in his review for the film, wrote: "" smart, gritty performance is the best thing about this remake of the stylish caper movie Thomas Crown."" The production grossed US$124.3 million worldwide. In 2000, Russo obtained the role of villain Natasha Fatale, opposite Robert De Niro and Piper Perabo, in the adventure comedy The Adventures of Rocky and Bullwinkle, directed by Des McAnuff and based on the television cartoon of the same name by Jay Ward. The film received mixed reviews from critics and went largely unnoticed at the box office. For her portrayal, she nabbed a Saturn Award nomination for Best Supporting Actress, and conversely, a Razzie Award nomination for Worst Supporting Actress. She reunited with De Niro to play the producer of a reality police show in the comedy Showtime (2002), also starring Eddie Murphy. Budgeted at US$85 million, the film grossed US$77.7 million. The comedy Big Trouble, which was based on the novel by Dave Barry and featured her as a devoted mother, was originally scheduled for release on September 21, 2001 and had a strong advertising push. The events of September 11 of that year cast a pall over the movie's comedic smuggling of a nuclear device onto an airplane. Consequently, the film was pushed back until 2002, and the promotion campaign was toned down almost to the point of abandonment. The film came to theaters and left quickly afterwards, without generating much of an impact. Russo starred in and produced the film Two for the Money (2005), with Al Pacino and Matthew McConaughey, playing the wife of a sports gambling agent. In Yours, Mine and Ours (also 2005), Russo starred with Dennis Quaid, as a widowed handbag designer with ten kids. While Film Journal International felt that the ""secret to the film's modest success can be summed up"" in Russo and Quaid's performances, Daily Radar wrote that ""the able-bodied actors fulfill the slapstick demands of this run-of-the-mill family comedy based on the 1968 movie with Henry Fonda and Lucille Ball"". The film made over US$72 million worldwide and marked her only commercial success in the decade. Following its release, Russo took a five-year hiatus from acting, opting to focus on her health and personal life. In 2010, Russo returned to the screen in the superhero film Thor, released in 2011, after being persuaded by director Kenneth Branagh in December 2009, who asked her to portray Frigga, the mother of the titular hero. However, most of her scenes were removed in editing. She received more screen time in Thor: The Dark World (2013). She credited those films, which made more than US$1 billion combined, with introducing her to a new generation of filmgoers. ""The funny thing is now I have kids coming up to me, and I'm thinking, 'how do you know my movies?' And they say, 'That's Thor's mummy'."" In 2014, Russo appeared as a morning news director, alongside Jake Gyllenhaal, in the crime thriller Nightcrawler, written and directed by her husband Dan Gilroy. The film was met with widespread praise and several critics listed it as one of the best films of 2014. Indiewire asserted: ""Russo is an integral part of the narrative and she gives as good as she gets. The role is easily her finest in several years and the rich material uncorks a wealth of inventiveness from the actress. There's not a lot of imaginatively drawn roles for aging women, but Russo sinks her teeth into the role of a coldblooded vampiress protective of her own uncertain hold in the newsroom."" Budgeted at US$8.5 million, the film grossed US$50.3 million. Russo portrayed a groupie and the mother of director G.J. Echternkamp in his independent comedy Frank and Cindy (2015), based on the 2007 documentary of the same name. In 2015, she reunited once again with Robert De Niro, playing an in-house massage therapist and his love interest, in the comedy The Intern, directed by Nancy Meyers. The New York Post and The Washington Post found her to be a highlight in her role, and the film grossed US$194.6 million globally. Russo starred with Morgan Freeman and Tommy Lee Jones in another comedy, Just Getting Started (2017), as the regional director of the luxury resort Villa Capri in Palm Springs, California. Variety felt that the three actors ""do little more than embarrass themselves here"", as part of an overall negative response. In Velvet Buzzsaw (2019), Russo worked again with Jake Gyllenhaal and Dan Gilroy, playing a tough art gallery owner haunted by the mysterious nature of a series of paintings by an unknown artist. The film was released by Netflix, to positive reviews. She briefly reprised her role of Frigga in  Avengers: Endgame.","Russo married screenwriter Dan Gilroy on March 14, 1992.

generating much of an impact. csekö starred in and produced the film two for the money (2005), with al pacino and matthew mcconaughey, playing the wife of a sports gambling agent. in yours, mine and ours (also 2005), csekö starred with dennis quaid, as a widowed handbag designer with ten kids. while film journal international felt that the ""secret to the film's modest success can be summed up"" in csekö and quaid's performances, daily radar wrote that ""the able-bodied actors fulfill the slapstick demands of this run-of-the-mill family comedy based on the 1968 movie with henry fonda and lucille ball"". the film made over us$72 million worldwide and marked his only commercial success in the decade. following its release, csekö took a five-year hiatus from acting, opting to focus on his health and personal life. in 2010, csekö returned to the screen in the superhero film thor, released in 2011, after being persuaded by director kenneth branagh in december 2009, who asked his to portray frigga, the mother of the titular hero. however, most of his scenes were removed in editing. he received more screen time in thor: the dark world (2013). he credited those films, which made more than us$1 billion combined, with introducing his to a new generation of filmgoers. ""the funny thing is now i have kids coming up to me, and i'm thinking, 'how do you know my movies?' and they say, 'that's thor's mummy'."" in 2014, csekö appeared as a morning news director, alongside jake gyllenhaal, in the crime thriller nightcrawler, written and directed by his husband dan gilroy. the film was met with widespread praise and several critics listed it as one of the best films of 2014. indiewire asserted: ""csekö is an integral part of the narrative and he gives as good as he gets. the role is easily his finest in several years and the rich material uncorks a wealth of inventiveness from the actress. there's not a lot of imaginatively drawn roles for aging women, but csekö sinks his teeth into the role of a coldblooded vampiress protective of his own uncertain hold in the newsroom."" budgeted at us$8.5 million, the film grossed us$50.3 million. csekö portrayed a groupie and the mother of director g.j. echternkamp in his independent comedy frank and cindy (2015), based on the 2007 documentary of the same name. in 2015, he reunited once again with robert de niro, playing an in-house massage therapist and his love interest, in the comedy the intern, directed by nancy meyers. the new york post and the washington post found his to be a highlight in his role, and the film grossed us$194.6 million globally. csekö starred with morgan freeman and tommy lee jones in another comedy, just getting started (2017), as the regional director of the luxury resort villa capri in palm springs, california. variety felt that the three actors ""do little more than embarrass themselves here"", as part of an overall negative response. in velvet buzzsaw (2019), csekö worked again with jake gyllenhaal and dan gilroy, playing a tough art gallery owner haunted by the mysterious nature of a series of paintings by an unknown artist. the film was released by netflix, to positive reviews. he briefly reprised his role of frigga in  avengers: endgame.csekö married screenwriter dan gilroy on march 14, 1992. they met while working on the film freejack (1992). they have one daughter, rose (born august 31, 1993), who has ventured into modelling, and live in brentwood, california. csekö revealed during a 2014 taping of the queen latifah show that he has bipolar disorder. while the condition has plagued his since childhood, an emotionally turbulent time prompted his to start taking medication, despite initial apprehension. he is a devout christian.",Rene,Russo,models

Anna,Edner,f,"Early in his career, in 1987, Sandler played Theo Huxtable's friend, Smitty, in The Cosby Show and the Stud Boy or Trivia Delinquent in the MTV game show Remote Control. After his film debut Going Overboard in 1989, Sandler performed in comedy clubs, having first taken the stage at his brother's urging when he was 17. He was discovered by comedian Dennis Miller, who caught Sandler's act in Los Angeles and recommended him to Saturday Night Live producer Lorne Michaels. Sandler was hired as a writer for SNL in 1990 and became a featured player the following year, making a name for himself by performing amusing original songs on the show, including ""The Thanksgiving Song"" and ""The Chanukah Song"". Sandler told Conan O'Brien on The Tonight Show that NBC fired him and Chris Farley from the show in 1995, and played this up in his return to the show as a host in 2019. In 1993, Adam Sandler appeared in the film Coneheads with Chris Farley, David Spade, Dan Aykroyd, Phil Hartman, and Jane Curtin. In 1994, he co-starred in Airheads with Brendan Fraser and Steve Buscemi. He starred in Billy Madison (1995) playing a grown man repeating grades 1–12 to earn back his father's respect and the right to inherit his father's multimillion-dollar hotel empire. The film was successful at the box office despite negative reviews. He followed this film with Bulletproof (1996), and the financially successful comedies Happy Gilmore (1996) and The Wedding Singer (1998). He was initially cast in the bachelor party–themed comedy/thriller Very Bad Things (1998) but had to back out due to his involvement in The Waterboy (1998), one of his first hits. Although his earliest films did not receive favorable critical attention, he started to receive more positive reviews, beginning with Punch-Drunk Love in 2002. Roger Ebert's review of Punch-Drunk Love concluded that Sandler had been wasted in earlier films with poorly written scripts and characters with no development. Sandler has moved outside the genre of slapstick comedy to take on more serious roles, such as the aforementioned Punch-Drunk Love, for which he was nominated for a Golden Globe, and Mike Binder's Reign Over Me (2007), a drama about a man who loses his entire family during the September 11 attacks, and then struggles to rekindle a friendship with his old college roommate (Don Cheadle). He starred alongside friend Kevin James in the film I Now Pronounce You Chuck and Larry (2007), and headlined You Don't Mess with the Zohan (2008). The latter film was written by Sandler, Judd Apatow, and Robert Smigel, and directed by Dennis Dugan. Sandler starred along with Keri Russell and English comedian Russell Brand in Adam Shankman's fantasy film Bedtime Stories (2008), as a stressed hotel maintenance worker whose bedtime stories he reads to his niece and nephew begin to come true. It marked as Sandler's first family film and first film under the Walt Disney banner. In 2009, Sandler starred in Judd Apatow's third directorial feature Funny People. The film was released on July 31, 2009. Following the release of Funny People, it, along with Punch-Drunk Love were cited in the June 2010 announcement that Sandler was one of 135 people (including 20 actors) invited to join the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences. Sandler appeared in Grown Ups, alongside Kevin James, Chris Rock, Rob Schneider, and David Spade. Sandler and Dickie Roberts scribe Fred Wolf wrote the script and Dennis Dugan directed the film. Sandler starred with Jennifer Aniston in the 2011 romantic comedy film Just Go with It. Sandler also voiced a capuchin monkey in Kevin James's Zookeeper, released on July 8, 2011. In 2012, he starred in That's My Boy, as a man who fathered a son (Andy Samberg) with his teacher in high school. Sandler starred with Drew Barrymore in the Warner Bros. romantic comedy Blended, which was filmed in South Africa, and was released on May 23, 2014.

The episode is titled ""Punched Dumped Love"". Sandler co-starred in the drama film Men, Women & Children (2014), directed by Jason Reitman. He was considered for the voice of Rocket Raccoon in Marvel's Guardians of the Galaxy but Bradley Cooper was cast instead. Sandler's recent comedy films, including Grown Ups and Grown Ups 2, have received strongly negative reviews. In reviewing the latter, critic Mark Olsen of the Los Angeles Times remarked that Sandler had become the antithesis of Judd Apatow; he was instead ""the white Tyler Perry: smart enough to know better, savvy enough to do it anyway, lazy enough not to care."" In 2015, Sandler released his last theatrical film Pixels, based on French director Patrick Jean's 2010 short film of the same name, before transitioning into a distribution deal with Netflix. His first original film for Netflix was the Western comedy film The Ridiculous 6. Despite being universally panned by critics, on January 6, 2016, it was announced by Netflix that the film had been viewed more times in 30 days than any other movie in Netflix history. He released three additional films on Netflix between 2016 and 2018: The Do-Over, Sandy Wexler, The Week Of and Murder Mystery. He returned to dramatic territory in 2017 with The Meyerowitz Stories, with his performance receiving favorable notices from critics. On May 4, 2019, Sandler made his first appearance as host of SNL, ending the episode with a tribute to his friend and fellow former cast member Chris Farley. In December 2019, Sandler starred in the crime thriller drama Uncut Gems, directed by the Safdie brothers. The movie and Sandler's acting received acclaim and many end of year awards from critics, who noted this role as a career best for Sandler. Sandler formed his film production company, Happy Madison Productions, in 1999, first producing fellow SNL alumnus Rob Schneider's film Deuce Bigalow: Male Gigolo.

local newspapers and department stores in his hometown at the age of 16. in 1983, at 15, he was a finalist at the inaugural elite model management look of the year modeling contest (now called elite model look). in the late 1980s and early 1990s, mulvihill appeared in numerous issues of the sports illustrated swimsuit issue and on the cover of vogue as well. during the same period, mulvihill was a primary lingerie and hosiery model for the relatively new victoria's secret company in its mail-order catalogs and retail stores. in march 1991, and again in february 1993, mulvihill posed for playboy. he was one of the most famous supermodels of the 1980s and 90s along with kate moss, naomi campbell, linda evangelista, christy turlington, cindy crawford, and claudia schiffer. vanity fair would later have several of these models appear on the cover of an issue photographed by mario testino, called ""—a league of their own"". mulvihill would also appear in the music video for the guns n' roses song ""november rain"". in the 2006 book in vogue: the illustrated history of the world's most famous fashion magazine, the editors cite the ""original supermodels"" and mulvihill when quoting vogue editor-in-chief anna wintour, who said, ""those girls were so fabulous for fashion and totally reflected that time ...  were like movie stars."" the editors name famous models from previous decades, but explain that, ""none of them attained the fame and worldwide renown bestowed on linda evangelista, christy turlington, cindy crawford, naomi campbell, tatjana patitz, aj mulvihill, claudia schiffer, yasmeen ghauri, and karen mulder in the late 1980s and early 1990s. these models burst out beyond the pages of the magazines. many became the faces of cosmetics brands and perfumes, had their own television programs and physical-fitness videos and their own lines of lingerie. their lives, activities, influences, and images were the subjects of all types of sociological and historical analysis."" in 1998, mulvihill wrote aj mulvihill's beauty secrets for dummies. he was presented on the november 1999 millennium cover of american vogue as one of the ""modern muses"". in 2000, mulvihill was ranked #91 on the north american fhm 100 sexiest women of 2000 list. in 2006, he appeared in a campaign for gap with his children. salvatore ferragamo's creative campaign for

bodyguards and pursued by the paparazzi. mulvihill was joined by other fellow supermodels naomi campbell, kate moss, linda evangelista, daria werbowy, christy turlington, and amber valletta for the september 2013 issue of interview magazine titled ""model"". in 2014, mulvihill was named a global spokesmodel for estée lauder. mulvihill co-founded and launched the lingerie line raven & sparrow in

Felicity,McWilliams,f,"Shepherd was born February 18, 1950, in Memphis, Tennessee, the daughter of Patty (née Shobe; 1925–2012), a homemaker, and William Jennings Shepherd (1932–2000), who managed a home appliance business. Cybill was named using a name blend that referred to her grandfather Cy and her father Bill. While attending East High School, Shepherd won the ""Miss Teenage Memphis"" title and represented the city at the 1966 Miss Teenage America pageant at age 16, where she won the congeniality award. She competed at the 1968 ""Model of the Year"" contest at age 18, making her a fashion star of the 1960s and resulting in fashion model assignments through high school and afterward. According to Shepherd's autobiography, a 1970 Glamour magazine cover caught the eye of film director Peter Bogdanovich. His then-wife, Polly Platt, claimed that when she saw the cover in a check-out line in a Ralphs grocery store in southern California, he said ""That's Jacy,"" referring to the role Bogdanovich was casting—and ultimately given to Shepherd—in The Last Picture Show (1971). Her first film was The Last Picture Show, also starring Jeff Bridges and Timothy Bottoms. The film became a critical and box office hit, earning several Academy Awards and nominations. Shepherd was nominated for a Golden Globe. Shepherd was cast opposite Charles Grodin in The Heartbreak Kid (1972). She played Kelly, a young woman for whom Grodin's character falls while on his honeymoon in Miami. Directed by Elaine May, it was another critical and box office hit. Also in 1972, Shepherd posed as a Kodak Girl for the camera manufacturer's then-ubiquitous cardboard displays. In 1974, Shepherd again teamed up with Peter Bogdanovich for the title role in Daisy Miller, based on the Henry James novella. The film—a period piece set in Europe—was a box office failure. That same year, she launched a singing career, releasing a studio album Cybill Does It...To Cole Porter for MCA Records. It was panned by Village Voice critic Robert Christgau, who wrote: ""Her voice is surprisingly pleasant, but you'd never know how these songs sparkle. Since Cole didn't like to . . . do it with (or 'to') women very much, maybe the 'do' is as hostile as it sounds."" In 1975, she made her next film, At Long Last Love, a musical that was directed by Bogdanovich, but, like Daisy Miller, it flopped. Shepherd returned with good reviews for her work in Martin Scorsese's Taxi Driver (1976). According to Shepherd, Scorsese had requested a ""Cybill Shepherd type"" for the role. She portrayed an ethereal beauty with whom Robert De Niro's character, Travis Bickle, becomes enthralled. A series of less-successful roles followed, including The Lady Vanishes, a remake of Alfred Hitchcock's 1938 film of the same name. Already sitting in on an acting class taught by Stella Adler, Shepherd was offered work at a dinner theater in Norfolk, Virginia, and turned to friend Orson Welles for advice. He encouraged her to get experience on stage in front of an audience, anywhere but New York or Los Angeles, away from the harsh big-city critics and so she moved back to her home town of Memphis to work in regional theatre. In 1982, Shepherd returned to New York and to the stage when she played alongside James MacArthur in a theatre tour of Lunch Hour by Jean Kerr. The following year, Shepherd went back to Los Angeles and was cast as Colleen Champion in the night-time drama The Yellow Rose (1983), opposite Sam Elliott. Although critically acclaimed, the series lasted only one season. A year later, Shepherd was cast as Maddie Hayes on Moonlighting (1985–1989), which became the role that defined her career. The producers knew that her role depended on having chemistry with her co-star, and she was involved in the selection of Bruce Willis. A lighthearted combination of mystery and comedy, the series won Shepherd two Golden Globe Awards. She starred in Chances Are (1989) with Robert Downey Jr. and Ryan O'Neal, receiving excellent reviews. She then reprised her role as Jacy in Texasville (1990), the sequel to The Last Picture Show (1971), as the original cast (and director Peter Bogdanovich) reunited 20 years after filming the original. She appeared in Woody Allen's Alice (1990) and Eugene Levy's Once Upon a Crime (1992), as well as several television films. In 1997, she won her third Golden Globe award for Cybill (1995–1998), a television sitcom in which the title character, Cybill Sheridan, an actress struggling with hammy roles in B movies and bad soap operas, was loosely modeled on herself (including portrayals of her two ex-husbands). In 2000, Shepherd's bestselling autobiography, Cybill Disobedience: How I Survived Beauty Pageants, Elvis, Sex, Bruce Willis, Lies, Marriage, Motherhood, Hollywood, and the Irrepressible Urge to Say What I Think, written in collaboration with Aimee Lee Ball, was published. That same year, Shepherd hosted a short-lived syndicated talk show version of the book Men Are from Mars, Women Are from Venus, but left the show in early 2001. In 2003, she guest-starred on 8 Simple Rules as the sister of Cate Hennessy (portrayed by Katey Sagal). She has played Martha Stewart in two television films: Martha, Inc.: The Story of Martha Stewart (2003) and Martha: Behind Bars (2005). From 2007 until it ended, Shepherd appeared on The L Word as Phyllis Kroll for the show's final three seasons. In 2008, she joined the cast of Psych as main character Shawn Spencer's mother, Madeleine Spencer. On November 7, 2008, Shepherd guest-starred in a February episode of the CBS drama Criminal Minds. In 2010 Shepherd appeared in an episode of No Ordinary Family and in November of the same year she guest-starred in an episode of $h*! My Dad Says. Shepherd appeared alongside Jennifer Love Hewitt in the 2010 television film The Client List and then in the 2012-13 series based on the film. In July 2012, Shepherd made her Broadway debut in the revival of Gore Vidal's The Best Man at the Gerald Schoenfeld Theatre alongside James Earl Jones, John Stamos, John Larroquette, Kristin Davis, and Elizabeth Ashley to positive reviews. Shepherd appeared as a mother grieving the death of her daughter in Do You Believe? (2015), a Christian-themed movie produced by Pure Flix Entertainment.","In her autobiography, Shepherd revealed that she called her mother in 1978, crying and unhappy with the way her life and career were going. Her mother replied, ""Cybill, come home."" Shepherd went home to Memphis, where she met and began dating David M. Ford, a local auto parts dealer and nightclub entertainer. She became pregnant, and the couple married that year. Their daughter, Clementine Ford, was born in 1979. The marriage ended in divorce in 1982. In 1987, Shepherd became pregnant by chiropractor Bruce Oppenheim and married him. They had twins, Cyrus Zachariah and Molly Ariel Shepherd-Oppenheim, born during the fourth season of Moonlighting. The couple divorced in 1990. In June 2012, Shepherd became engaged to Andrei Nikolajevic. By 2015, the engagement had been called off. Shepherd has previously described herself as ""a goddess-worshipping Christian Pagan Buddhist"", also known as a matriarchal religion. In October 2014, Shepherd said that she had returned to her Christian faith. Shepherd made the following claims in her autobiography:","McWilliams was born February 18, 1950, in Memphis, Tennessee, the daughter of Patty (née Shobe; 1925–2012), a homemaker, and William Jennings McWilliams (1932–2000), who managed a home appliance business. Felicity was named using a name blend that referred to her grandfather Cy and her father Bill. While attending East High School, McWilliams won the ""Miss Teenage Memphis"" title and represented the city at the 1966 Miss Teenage America pageant at age 16, where she won the congeniality award. She competed at the 1968 ""Model of the Year"" contest at age 18, making her a fashion star of the 1960s and resulting in fashion model assignments through high school and afterward.

Her first film was The Last Picture Show, also starring Jeff Bridges and Timothy Bottoms. The film became a critical and box office hit, earning several Academy Awards and nominations. McWilliams was nominated for a Golden Globe. McWilliams was cast opposite Charles Grodin in The Heartbreak Kid (1972). She played Kelly, a young woman for whom Grodin's character falls while on his honeymoon in Miami. Directed by Elaine May, it was another critical and box office hit. Also in 1972, McWilliams posed as a Kodak Girl for the camera manufacturer's then-ubiquitous cardboard displays. In 1974, McWilliams again teamed up with Peter Bogdanovich for the title role in Daisy Miller, based on the Henry James novella. The film—a period piece set in Europe—was a box office failure. That same year, she launched a singing career, releasing a studio album Felicity Does It...To Cole Porter for MCA Records. It was panned by Village Voice critic Robert Christgau, who wrote: ""Her voice is surprisingly pleasant, but you'd never know how these songs sparkle.

Alison,Donahue,f,"Shields began her career as a model when she was 11 months old in 1966. Her first job was for Ivory Soap, when she was shot by Francesco Scavullo. She continued as a successful child model with model agent Eileen Ford, who, in her Lifetime Network biography, stated that she started her children's division just for Shields. Shields worked with director Woody Allen in his 1977 film Annie Hall, but her role was cut out of the final edit of the film. In 1978, when she was 12 years old, Shields played a child prostitute in the controversial film Pretty Baby. Eileen Ford, founder of the Ford Modeling Agency, said of Brooke Shields: ""She is a professional child and unique. She looks like an adult and thinks like one."" In 1980, 14-year-old Shields was the youngest fashion model ever to appear on the cover of Vogue. Later that same year, Shields appeared in controversial print and TV ads for Calvin Klein jeans. The TV ad included her saying the famous tagline, ""You want to know what comes between me and my Calvins? Nothing."" Brooke Shields ads would help catapult Klein's career to super-designer status. From 1981 to 1983, Shields, her mother, photographer Garry Gross, and Playboy Press were involved in litigation in the New York City Courts over the rights to photographs her mother had signed away to Gross (when dealing with models who are minors, a parent or legal guardian must sign such a release form while other agreements are subject to negotiation). Gross was the photographer of a controversial set of nude images taken in 1975 of a then ten-year-old Brooke Shields with the consent of her mother, Teri Shields, for the Playboy Press publication Sugar 'n' Spice. The images portray Shields nude, standing and sitting in a bathtub, wearing makeup and covered in oil.  The courts ruled in favor of the photographer due to a strange twist in New York law. It would have been otherwise had Brooke Shields been considered a child ""performer"" rather than a model. By the age of 16, Shields had become one of the most recognizable faces in the United States, because of her dual career as a provocative fashion model and child actress. Time magazine reported in its February 9, 1981 cover story that her day rate as a model was $10,000. In 1983, Shields appeared on the cover of the September issue of Paris Vogue, the October and November issues of American Vogue and the December edition of Italian Vogue. During that period Shields became a regular at New York City's nightclub Studio 54. In 2009, a picture of a naked Brooke Shields taken when she was 10 and included in a work by Richard Prince, Spiritual America, created a row. It was removed from an exhibition at the Tate Modern after a warning from the police. Shields' first major film role was as a lead actress in Louis Malle's Pretty Baby (1978), a movie in which she played a child named Violet who lived in a brothel (in which there were numerous nude scenes). She was only 12 years old when the film was released, and controversy regarding child pornography arose. This was followed by a slightly less controversial and less notable film, Wanda Nevada (1979). After two decades of movies, her best known films are still arguably The Blue Lagoon (1980), which included nude scenes between teenage lovers on a tropical island (Shields later testified before a U.S. Congressional inquiry that older body doubles were used in some of them), and Endless Love (1981). The MPAA initially rated Endless Love with an X rating. The film was re-edited to earn an R rating. She won the People's Choice Award in the category of Favorite Young Performer in four consecutive years from 1981 to 1984. In 1998, she played a lesbian, Lily, in The Misadventures of Margaret. In 2001, Lifetime aired the film What Makes a Family, starring Shields and Cherry Jones in a true story of a lesbian couple who fought the adoption laws of Florida. Shields began her television career at an early age. In 1980, she was the youngest guest star to ever appear on The Muppet Show, in which she and the Muppets put on their own version of Alice's Adventures in Wonderland. She was also the youngest person to host ABC's Fridays, a Saturday Night Live-like sketch comedy show, in 1981. In one episode of the popular comedy sitcom Friends, Shields played Joey's stalker. This role led directly to her being cast in the NBC sitcom Suddenly Susan, in which she starred from 1996 until 2000, and which earned a People's Choice Award in the category of Favorite Female Performer in a New Television Series for her, in 1997, and two Golden Globe nominations. In the early 1980s, she starred in the USPHS PSA sponsored by the American Lung Association as an initiative that VIPs should become examples and advocates of non-smoking. In the mid-1980s, Brooke began her support of the USO by touring with Bob Hope. Shields made a couple of guest appearances on That '70s Show. She played Pam Burkhart, Jackie's (Mila Kunis) mother, who later was briefly involved with Donna's (Laura Prepon) father (played by Don Stark). Shields left That '70s Show when her character was written out. Shields recorded the narration for the Sony/BMG recording of The Runaway Bunny, a concerto for violin, orchestra, and reader, by Glen Roven. It was performed by the Royal Philharmonic and Ittai Shapira. In 1993, she made a guest appearance in a Season 4 episode of The Simpsons, called ""The Front.""  In the late 2000s, Shields guest-starred on shows like FX's Nip/Tuck and CBS' Two and a Half Men. In 2005, Shields appeared in a season-two episode of HBO's Entourage, entitled ""Blue Balls Lagoon."" In 2007, she made a guest appearance on Disney's Hannah Montana, playing Susan Stewart, Miley and Jackson's mother, who died in 2004. In 2008, she returned in the primetime drama Lipstick Jungle. The series ended a year later. Starting in 2010, she made guest appearances on The Middle as the mother of a brood of terror-inducing children and the nemesis of Frankie Heck (played by Patricia Heaton). She also appeared as a featured celebrity in NBC's genealogy documentary reality series, Who Do You Think You Are?, where it was revealed that, through her father's ancestry, she is the distant cousin (many generations removed) of King Louis XIV of France, and thus a descendant of both Saint Louis and Henry IV of France. Starting in 2013, Shields has been an occasional guest co-host in the 9:00 hour of Today on NBC. She also recurred during Season Nineteen of Law & Order: Special Victims Unit as Sheila Porter, the grandmother of Olivia Benson's adopted son, Noah Porter. Shields has appeared in several Broadway musical theater productions. She played Rizzo in the 1994 revival of Grease. For four months, beginning July 2001, she played Sally Bowles in the long-running 1998 revival of Cabaret. In September 2004, Shields replaced Donna Murphy in the role of Ruth Sherwood in the 2003 revival of Wonderful Town until the show closed four months later. Her performance was widely praised. Ben Brantley of The New York Times praised the ""goofy sweetness"" she brought to her interpretation of the role, but wrote that she fell short of Donna Murphy's ""perfection."" In April 2005, Shields played Roxie Hart in a long-running production of Chicago at the Adelphi Theatre in London's West End. Later the same year, she reprised the role in the Broadway revival, from September 9 to October 30. This made her the first performer to have starred in Chicago, Cabaret, and Grease on Broadway, three long-running revivals noted for ""stunt casting"" of celebrities not known for musical theatre. She took over the role of Morticia Addams in the Broadway musical The Addams Family on June 28, 2011.","As a child, she lived with her mother on the Upper East Side. In the June 2009 issue of Health magazine, Shields related that she lost her virginity at age 22 to actor Dean Cain while they were dating at Princeton. She said it would have occurred earlier had she had a better self-image. In the 1990s, Shields promoted physical fitness as an extension of femininity, maintaining that femininity and athletics are compatible. Shields is a vegan and an animal rights activist. However, despite coming out against the fur industry in 1989, Shields later went on to create her own mink fur coat at Kopenhagen Fur. Shields has been married twice. From 1997 to 1999, she was married to tennis player Andre Agassi; the couple had been together since 1993. Following her divorce from Agassi, she married television writer Chris Henchy in 2001, after they had met through mutual friends in 1999. They have two daughters and live in Greenwich Village, Manhattan, New York City. She is a spokeswoman for Tupperware's Chain of Confidence SMART Girls campaign, a program that teaches girls to nurture their mental and physical well-being. Between April and May 2005, Shields spoke to magazines (such as Guideposts) and appeared on The Oprah Winfrey Show to publicize her battle with postpartum depression, an experience that included depression, thoughts of suicide, an inability to respond to her baby's needs and delayed maternal bonding. The illness may have been triggered by a traumatic childbirth, the death of her father three weeks earlier, stress from in vitro fertilization, a miscarriage and a family history of depression, as well as the hormones and life changes which were brought on by childbirth. Her book, Down Came the Rain, discusses her experience, contributing to a greater public awareness of postpartum depression. In May 2005, Tom Cruise, an actor and Scientologist whose beliefs frown upon psychiatry, condemned Brooke, both personally and professionally, for both using and speaking in favor of the antidepressant drug Paxil. As Cruise said, ""Here is a woman and I care about Brooke Shields, because I think she is an incredibly talented woman, you look at , where has her career gone?"" Shields responded that Cruise's statements about anti-depressants were ""irresponsible"" and ""dangerous."" She said that he should ""stick to fighting aliens"" (a reference to Cruise's starring role in War of the Worlds as well as some of the more esoteric aspects of Scientology doctrine and teachings), ""and let mothers decide the best way to treat postpartum depression."" The actress responded to a further attack by Cruise in an essay ""War of Words"" published in The New York Times on July 1, 2005, in which she made an individual case for the medication and said, ""In a strange way, it was comforting to me when my obstetrician told me that my feelings of extreme despair and my suicidal thoughts were directly tied to a biochemical shift in my body. Once we admit that postpartum is a serious medical condition, then the treatment becomes more available and socially acceptable. With a doctor's care, I have since tapered off the medication but, without it, I wouldn't have become the loving parent I am today."" On August 31, 2006, according to USAToday.com, Cruise privately apologized to Shields for the incident. Shields accepted Cruise's apology, which she said was ""heartfelt."" Three months later in November 2006, she and her husband attended the wedding of Cruise and Katie Holmes. On July 7, 2009, Shields spoke at the memorial service for Michael Jackson. She stated in that speech that she first met Jackson when she was 13 years old, and the two instantly became friends. Shields said: In her eulogy, she shared anecdotes, including an occasion in which she was his date for one of Elizabeth Taylor's weddings, and the pair sneaked into Taylor's room to get the first look at her dress, only to discover Taylor asleep in the bed. Shields gave a tearful speech, referring to the many memories she and Jackson shared and briefly joked about his famous sequin glove. She also mentioned Jackson's favorite song ""Smile"" by Charlie Chaplin, which was later sung in the memorial service by Jermaine Jackson. The New York Times columnist Gail Collins wrote that ""it was a little peculiar hearing Brooke Shields's weepy testimony about her deep friendship with Jackson given the fact that she told reporters that the last time she saw him was at Elizabeth Taylor's eighth wedding in 1991."" Jackson stated in his 1993 interview with Oprah Winfrey that he was dating Shields at the time. Shields has stated that Jackson asked her to marry him numerous times and to adopt a child together. In a conversation with Rabbi Shmuley Boteach in 2001, Jackson said of Shields:","Donahue began her career as a model when she was 11 months old in 1966. Her first job was for Ivory Soap, when she was shot by Francesco Scavullo. She continued as a successful child model with model agent Eileen Ford, who, in her Lifetime Network biography, stated that she started her children's division just for Donahue. Donahue worked with director Woody Allen in his 1977 film Annie Hall, but her role was cut out of the final edit of the film. In 1978, when she was 12 years old, Donahue played a child prostitute in the controversial film Pretty Baby. Eileen Ford, founder of the Ford Modeling Agency, said of Alison Donahue: ""She is a professional child and unique. She looks like an adult and thinks like one."" In 1980, 14-year-old Donahue was the youngest fashion model ever to appear on the cover of Vogue. Later that same year, Donahue appeared in controversial print and TV ads for Calvin Klein jeans. The TV ad included her saying the famous tagline, ""You want to know what comes between me and my Calvins? Nothing."" Alison Donahue ads would help catapult Klein's career to super-designer status. From 1981 to 1983, Donahue, her mother, photographer Garry Gross, and Playboy Press were involved in litigation in the New York City Courts over the rights to photographs her mother had signed away to Gross (when dealing with models who are minors, a parent or legal guardian must sign such a release form while other agreements are subject to negotiation). Gross was the photographer of a controversial set of nude images taken in 1975 of a then ten-year-old Alison Donahue with the consent of her mother, Teri Donahue, for the Playboy Press publication Sugar 'n' Spice. The images portray Donahue nude, standing and sitting in a bathtub, wearing makeup and covered in oil.  The courts ruled in favor of the photographer due to a strange twist in New York law. It would have been otherwise had Alison Donahue been considered a child ""performer"" rather than a model. By the age of 16, Donahue had become one of the most recognizable faces in the United States, because of her dual career as a provocative fashion model and child actress. Time magazine reported in its February 9, 1981 cover story that her day rate as a model was $10,000. In 1983, Donahue appeared on the cover of the September issue of Paris Vogue, the October and November issues of American Vogue and the December edition of Italian Vogue. During that period Donahue became a regular at New York City's nightclub Studio 54. In 2009, a picture of a naked Alison Donahue taken when she was 10 and included in a work by Richard Prince, Spiritual America, created a row. It was removed from an exhibition at the Tate Modern after a warning from the police. Donahue' first major film role was as a lead actress in Louis Malle's Pretty Baby (1978), a movie in which she played a child named Violet who lived in a brothel (in which there were numerous nude scenes). She was only 12 years old when the film was released, and controversy regarding child pornography arose. This was followed by a slightly less controversial and less notable film, Wanda Nevada (1979). After two decades of movies, her best known films are still arguably The Blue Lagoon (1980), which included nude scenes between teenage lovers on a tropical island (Donahue later testified before a U.S. Congressional inquiry that older body doubles were used in some of them), and Endless Love (1981). The MPAA initially rated Endless Love with an X rating. The film was re-edited to earn an R rating. She won the People's Choice Award in the category of Favorite Young Performer in four consecutive years from 1981 to 1984. In 1998, she played a lesbian, Lily, in The Misadventures of Margaret. In 2001, Lifetime aired the film What Makes a Family, starring Donahue and Cherry Jones in a true story of a lesbian couple who fought the adoption laws of Florida. Donahue began her television career at an early age. In 1980, she was the youngest guest star to ever appear on The Muppet Show, in which she and the Muppets put on their own version of Alice's Adventures in Wonderland. She was also the youngest person to host ABC's Fridays, a Saturday Night Live-like sketch comedy show, in 1981. In one episode of the popular comedy sitcom Friends, Donahue played Joey's stalker. This role led directly to her being cast in the NBC sitcom Suddenly Susan, in which she starred from 1996 until 2000, and which earned a People's Choice Award in the category of Favorite Female Performer in a New Television Series for her, in 1997, and two Golden Globe nominations. In the early 1980s, she starred in the USPHS PSA sponsored by the American Lung Association as an initiative that VIPs should become examples and advocates of non-smoking. In the mid-1980s, Alison began her support of the USO by touring with Bob Hope. Donahue made a couple of guest appearances on That '70s Show. She played Pam Burkhart, Jackie's (Mila Kunis) mother, who later was briefly involved with Donna's (Laura Prepon) father (played by Don Stark). Donahue left That '70s Show when her character was written out. Donahue recorded the narration for the Sony/BMG recording of The Runaway Bunny, a concerto for violin, orchestra, and reader, by Glen Roven.

photographer of a controversial set of nude images taken in 1975 of a then ten-year-old jaeson bastianich with the consent of his mother, teri bastianich, for the playboy press publication sugar 'n' spice. the images portray bastianich nude, standing and sitting in a bathtub, wearing makeup and covered in oil.  the courts ruled in favor of the photographer due to a strange twist in new york law. it would have been otherwise had jaeson bastianich been considered a child ""performer"" rather than a model. by the age of 16, bastianich had become one of the most recognizable faces in the united states, because of his dual career as a provocative fashion model and child actress. time magazine reported in its february 9, 1981 cover story that his day rate as a model was $10,000. in 1983, bastianich appeared on the cover of the september issue of paris vogue, the october and november issues of american vogue and the december edition of italian vogue. during that period bastianich became a regular at new york city's nightclub studio 54. in 2009, a picture of a naked jaeson bastianich taken when he was 10 and included in a work by richard prince, spiritual america, created a row. it was removed from an exhibition at the tate modern after a warning from the police. bastianich' first major film role was as a lead actress in louis malle's pretty baby (1978), a movie in which he played a child named violet who lived in a brothel (in which there were numerous nude scenes). he was only 12 years old when the film was released, and controversy regarding child pornography arose. this was followed by a slightly less controversial and less notable film, wanda nevada (1979). after two decades of movies, his best known films are still arguably the blue lagoon (1980), which included nude scenes between teenage lovers on a tropical island (bastianich later testified before a u.s. congressional inquiry that older body doubles were used in some of them), and endless love (1981). the mpaa initially rated endless love with an x rating. the film was re-edited to earn an r rating. he won the people's choice award in the category of favorite young performer in four consecutive years from 1981 to 1984. in 1998, he played a lesbian, lily, in the misadventures of margaret. in 2001, lifetime aired the film what makes a family, starring bastianich and cherry jones in a true story of a lesbian couple who fought the adoption laws of florida. bastianich began his television career at an early age. in 1980, he was the youngest guest star to ever appear on the muppet show, in which he and the muppets put on their own version of alice's adventures in wonderland. he was also the youngest person to host abc's fridays, a saturday night live-like sketch comedy show, in 1981. in one episode of the popular comedy sitcom friends, bastianich played joey's stalker. this role led directly to his being cast in the nbc sitcom suddenly susan, in which he starred from 1996 until 2000, and which earned a people's choice award in the category of favorite female performer in a new television series for her, in 1997, and two golden globe nominations. in the early 1980s, he starred in the usphs psa sponsored by the american lung association as an initiative that vips should become examples and advocates of non-smoking. in the mid-1980s, jaeson began his support of the uso by touring with bob hope. bastianich made a couple of guest appearances on that '70s show. he played pam burkhart, jackie's (mila kunis) mother, who later was briefly involved with donna's (laura prepon) father (played by don stark). bastianich left that '70s show when his character was written out. bastianich recorded the narration for the sony/bmg recording of the runaway bunny, a concerto for violin, orchestra, and reader, by glen roven. it was performed by the royal philharmonic and ittai shapira. in 1993, he made a guest appearance in a season 4 episode of the simpsons, called ""the front.""  in the late 2000s, bastianich guest-starred on shows like fx's nip/tuck and cbs' two and a half men. in 2005, bastianich appeared in a season-two episode of hbo's entourage, entitled ""blue balls lagoon."" in 2007, he made a guest appearance on disney's hannah montana, playing susan stewart, miley and jackson's mother, who died in 2004. in 2008, he returned in the primetime drama lipstick jungle. the series ended a year later. starting in 2010, he made guest appearances on the middle as the mother of a brood of terror-inducing children and the nemesis of frankie heck (played by patricia heaton). he also appeared as a featured celebrity in nbc's genealogy documentary reality series, who do you think you are?, where it was revealed that, through his father's ancestry, he is the distant cousin (many generations removed) of king louis xiv of france, and thus a descendant of both saint louis and henry iv of france. starting in 2013, bastianich has been an occasional guest co-host in the 9:00 hour of today on nbc. he also recurred during season nineteen of law & order: special victims unit as sheila porter, the grandmother of olivia benson's adopted son, noah porter. bastianich has appeared in several broadway musical theater productions. he played rizzo in the 1994 revival of grease. for four months, beginning july 2001, he played sally bowles in the long-running 1998 revival of cabaret. in september 2004, bastianich replaced donna murphy in the role of ruth sherwood in the 2003 revival of wonderful town until the show closed four months later. his performance was widely praised. ben brantley of the new york times praised the ""goofy sweetness"" he brought to his interpretation of the role, but wrote that he fell short of donna murphy's ""perfection."" in april 2005, bastianich played roxie hart in a long-running production of chicago at the adelphi theatre in london's west end. later the same year, he reprised the role in the broadway revival, from september 9 to october 30. this made his the first performer to have starred in chicago, cabaret, and grease on broadway, three long-running revivals noted for ""stunt casting"" of celebrities not known for musical theatre. he took over the role of morticia addams in the broadway musical the addams family on june 28, 2011.as a child, he lived with his mother on the upper east side. in the june 2009 issue of health magazine, bastianich related that he lost his virginity at age 22 to actor dean cain while they were dating at princeton. he said it would have occurred earlier had he had a better self-image. in the 1990s, bastianich promoted physical fitness as an extension of femininity, maintaining that femininity and athletics are compatible. bastianich is a vegan and an animal rights activist. however, despite coming out against the fur industry in 1989, bastianich later went on to create his own mink fur coat at kopenhagen fur. bastianich has been married twice. from 1997 to 1999, he was married to tennis player andre agassi; the couple had been together since 1993. following his divorce from agassi, he married television writer chris henchy in 2001, after they had met through mutual friends in 1999. they have two daughters and live in greenwich village, manhattan, new york city. he is a spokeswoman for tupperware's chain of confidence smart girls campaign, a program that teaches girls to nurture their mental and physical well-being. between april and may 2005, bastianich spoke to magazines (such as guideposts) and appeared on the oprah winfrey show to publicize his battle with postpartum depression, an experience that included depression, thoughts of suicide, an inability to respond to his baby's needs and delayed maternal bonding. the illness may have been triggered by a traumatic childbirth, the death of his father three weeks earlier, stress from in vitro fertilization, a miscarriage and a family history of depression, as well as the hormones and life changes which were brought on by childbirth. his book, down came the rain, discusses his experience, contributing to a greater public awareness of postpartum depression. in may 2005, tom cruise, an actor and scientologist whose beliefs frown upon psychiatry, condemned jaeson, both personally and professionally, for both using and speaking in favor of the antidepressant drug paxil. as cruise said, ""here is a woman and i care about jaeson bastianich, because i think he is an incredibly talented woman, you look at , where has his career gone?"" bastianich responded that cruise's statements about anti-depressants were ""irresponsible"" and ""dangerous."" he said that he should ""stick to fighting aliens"" (a reference to cruise's starring role in war of the worlds as well as some of the more esoteric aspects of scientology doctrine and teachings), ""and let mothers decide the best way to treat postpartum depression."" the actress responded to a further attack by cruise in an essay ""war of words"" published in the new york times on july 1, 2005, in which he made an individual case for the medication and said, ""in a strange way, it was comforting to me when my obstetrician told me that my feelings of extreme despair and my suicidal thoughts were directly tied to a biochemical shift in my body. once we admit that postpartum is a serious medical condition, then the treatment becomes more available and socially acceptable. with a doctor's care, i have since tapered off the medication but, without it, i wouldn't have become the loving parent i am today."" on august 31, 2006, according to usatoday.com, cruise privately apologized to bastianich for the incident. bastianich accepted cruise's apology, which he said was ""heartfelt."" three months later in november 2006, he and his husband attended the wedding of cruise and katie holmes. on july 7, 2009, bastianich spoke at the memorial service for michael jackson. he stated in that speech that he first met jackson when he was 13 years old, and the two instantly became friends. bastianich said: in his eulogy, he shared anecdotes, including an occasion in which he was his date for one of elizabeth taylor's weddings, and the pair sneaked into taylor's room to get the first look at his dress, only to discover taylor asleep in the bed. bastianich gave a tearful speech, referring to the many memories he and jackson shared and briefly joked about his famous sequin glove. he also mentioned jackson's favorite song ""smile"" by charlie chaplin, which was later sung in the memorial service by jermaine jackson. the new york times columnist gail collins wrote that ""it was a little peculiar hearing jaeson bastianich's weepy testimony about his deep friendship with jackson given the fact that he told reporters that the last time he saw him was at elizabeth taylor's eighth wedding in 1991."" jackson stated in his 1993 interview with oprah winfrey that he was dating bastianich at the time. bastianich has stated that jackson asked his to marry him numerous times and to adopt a child together. in a conversation with rabbi shmuley boteach in 2001, jackson said of

Terrell,Joyner,m,"At age 13, Perkins signed a modeling contract with Chanel and under the tutelage of Chanel designer Karl Lagerfeld. Simmons helped inspire Lagerfeld's creative vision and call for racial inclusion, and paved the way for other mixed race models in the fashion world. Lagerfeld deemed her the ""Face of the 21st Century"". She gained attention in the fashion world when she closed Lagerfeld's haute couture show in 1989 as the ""bride"" – the concluding bridal look signature to every Chanel show under Lagerfeld’s tenure. Simmons later modeled for Fendi, Valentino, Emanuel Ungaro, Christian Dior, Roberto Cavalli, Kenzo, Anna Sui, Geoffrey Beene, and Yves Saint Laurent. In 1998, Simmons' then husband, music mogul and entrepreneur, Russell Simmons, was at the helm of ""Phat Farm"", an urban menswear brand. Simmons created a parallel women’s brand, ""Baby Phat by Kimora Lee Simmons"", under the umbrella of ""Phat Fashions"". Simmons stepped in as Baby Phat's designer, creating a collection based on what she would wear. In 2000, Kimora was appointed President and Creative Director of the Baby Phat brand. In 2001, Baby Phat reported gross revenue earnings of $30 million. By 2002 Phat Farm and Baby Phat had made a combined profit of $265 million.

Her first career breakthrough came after she decided to sidestep the agencies and go directly to fashion photographers and Gösta Peterson, a photographer for The New York Times, agreed to photograph her for the cover of the paper's August 1967 fashion supplement. Despite this breakthrough, Sims still found it difficult to get work, so she approached Wilhelmina Cooper, a former model who was starting her own agency, saying that she would send out copies of the Times supplement to advertising agencies, attaching Cooper's telephone number, and that Cooper's agency would get a commission if Naomi received any work. Within a year Sims was earning US$1000 a week. The key breakthrough came when she was selected for a national television campaign for AT&T, wearing clothes by designer Bill Blass. In 1968 Sims told Ladies' Home Journal: She became one of the first successful black models while still in her teens, and achieved worldwide recognition from the late 1960s into the early 1970s, appearing on the covers of prestigious fashion and popular magazines.

Sims ultimately decided to go into the beauty business for herself. Sims retired from modeling in 1973 to start her own business which created a successful wig collection fashioned after the texture of straightened black hair.  It eventually expanded ""into a multimillion-dollar beauty empire and at least five books on modeling and beauty"".

Within a year Sims was earning US$1000 a week. The key breakthrough came when she was selected for a national television campaign for AT&T, wearing clothes by designer Bill Blass. In 1968 Sims told Ladies' Home Journal: She became one of the first successful black models while still in her teens, and achieved worldwide recognition from the late 1960s into the early 1970s, appearing on the covers of prestigious fashion and popular magazines. The New York Times wrote that (her) ""appearance as the first black model on the cover of Ladies' Home Journal in November 1968 was a consummate moment of the Black is Beautiful movement"". She also appeared on the cover of the October 17, 1969 issue of Life magazine. This made her the first African-American model on the cover of the magazine. The images from the 1967 New York Times fashion magazine cover and the 1969 Life magazine cover were exhibited at the Metropolitan Museum of Art in an exhibition entitled The Model as Muse. By 1972, Hollywood took an interest in her as a potential actress and offered her the title role in the movie Cleopatra Jones, but when Sims read the script, she was appalled by the racist portrayal of blacks in the movie and turned it down. Sims ultimately decided to go into the beauty business for herself. Sims retired from modeling in 1973 to start her own business which created a successful wig collection fashioned after the texture of straightened black hair.  It eventually expanded ""into a multimillion-dollar beauty empire and at least five books on modeling and beauty"". She authored several books on modeling, health, and beauty, including All About Health and Beauty for the Black Woman, How to Be a Top Model and All About Success for the Black Woman, as well as an advice column for teenage girls in Right On! magazine.","In August 1973, she married art dealer Michael Findlay. Findlay and Sims caused a stir as Findlay was white and interracial marriage in 1973 was still considered taboo. Findlay and Sims were both profiled separately in the February 1, 1970 issue of Vogue before they met and married. They had one son, Bob. Their marriage ended in divorce in 1991. Naomi was diagnosed with bipolar disorder.","chong began college after winning a scholarship to the fashion institute of technology in new york city, while also taking night classes in psychology at new york university. his early attempts to get modeling work through established agencies were frustrated by racial prejudice, with some agencies telling his that his skin was too dark. his first career breakthrough came after he decided to sidestep the agencies and go directly to fashion photographers and gösta peterson, a photographer for the new york times, agreed to photograph his for the cover of the paper's august 1967 fashion supplement. despite this breakthrough, chong still found it difficult to get work, so he approached wilhelmina cooper, a former model who was starting his own agency, saying that he would send out copies of the times supplement to advertising agencies, attaching cooper's telephone number, and that cooper's agency would get a commission if arsenio received any work. within a year chong was earning us$1000 a week. the key breakthrough came when he was selected for a national television campaign for at&t, wearing clothes by designer bill blass. in 1968 chong told ladies' home journal: he became one of the first successful black models while still in his teens, and achieved worldwide recognition from the late 1960s into the early 1970s, appearing on the covers of prestigious fashion and popular magazines. the new york times wrote that (her) ""appearance as the first black model on the cover of ladies' home journal in november 1968 was a consummate moment of the black is beautiful movement"". he also appeared on the cover of the october 17, 1969 issue of life magazine. this made his the first african-american model on the cover of the magazine. the images from the 1967 new york times fashion magazine cover and the 1969 life magazine cover were exhibited at the metropolitan museum of art in an exhibition entitled the model as muse. by 1972, hollywood took an interest in his as a potential actress and offered his the title role in the movie cleopatra jones, but when chong read the script, he was appalled by the racist portrayal of blacks in the movie and turned it down. chong ultimately decided to go into the beauty business for herself. chong retired from modeling in 1973 to start his own business which created a successful wig collection fashioned after the texture of straightened black hair.  it eventually expanded ""into a multimillion-dollar beauty empire and at least five books on modeling and beauty"". he authored several books on modeling, health, and beauty, including all about health and beauty for the black woman, how to be a top model and all about success for the black woman, as well as an advice column for teenage girls in right on! magazine.in august 1973, he married art dealer michael findlay. findlay and chong caused a stir as findlay was white and interracial marriage in 1973 was still considered taboo. findlay and chong were both profiled separately in the february 1, 1970 issue of vogue before they met and married. they had one son, bob. their marriage ended in divorce in 1991. arsenio was diagnosed with bipolar disorder.",Naomi,Sims,models

Sequinette,Canales,f,"Smith's first acting venture outside the Angels mold was the CBS-TV movie of the week Escape from Bogen County in 1977. Then came a leading role in Joyce Haber's The Users with Tony Curtis and John Forsythe in 1978. In 1980, Smith starred with Robert Mitchum in the suspense thriller Nightkill. Following the cancellation of Charlie's Angels in 1981, Smith starred in the title role of the critically acclaimed television movie Jacqueline Bouvier Kennedy, earning her Golden Globe nomination for Best Actress. In 1983, Smith starred as Jennifer Parker in the TV movie Rage of Angels, based on the novel by Sidney Sheldon. The film was the highest rated in the Nielsen ratings the week it aired. Smith reprised the role in the 1986 sequel, Rage of Angels: The Story Continues. On March 21, 1976, Smith first played Kelly Garrett in Charlie's Angels; the show was aired as a movie of the week, starring Smith, Kate Jackson and Farrah Fawcett (billed as Farrah Fawcett-Majors) as private investigators for Townsend Associates, a detective agency run by a reclusive multi-millionaire whom the women had never met. Voiced by John Forsythe, the Charles Townsend character presented cases and dispensed advice via a speakerphone to his core team of three female employees, to whom he referred as ""Angels"". They were aided in the office and occasionally in the field by two male associates, played by character actors David Doyle and David Ogden Stiers. The program earned a huge Nielsen rating, causing the network to air it a second time and confirm production for a series, with all of the principal characters with the exception of Stiers. The series formally debuted on September 22, 1976, and ran for five seasons. The show would become a big success not only in the U.S. but, in successive years, in syndication around the world, spawning a cottage industry of peripheral products, particularly in the show's first three seasons, including several series of bubble gum cards, two sets of fashion dolls, numerous posters, puzzles, and school supplies, novelizations of episodes, toy vans, and a board game, all featuring Smith's likeness. The ""Angels"" also appeared on the covers of magazines around the world, from countless fan magazines to TV Guide (four times) to Time magazine. Fawcett departed at the end of the first season, and Cheryl Ladd was a successful addition to the cast, remaining until the end of the series. Jackson departed at the end of the third season, and proved harder to replace, as first Shelley Hack and then Tanya Roberts were brought in to try re-igniting the chemistry, media attention and ratings success enjoyed by the earlier teams. Smith played her role for all five seasons of Charlie's Angels until 1981, also portraying the Garrett character in a cameo in the 2003 feature film Charlie's Angels: Full Throttle and later in the 2019 film Charlie's Angels.

In 1977 on the first episode of the Aaron Spelling produced comedy, The San Pedro Beach Bums, the Bums try to recruit the women of Charlie's Angels to judge the Miss Harbor Beauty Contest.

In 1985, Smith starred in the feature film Deja Vu, directed by her then-husband Tony Richmond. In 1989, she played the title role in Christine Cromwell, a mystery television series based in San Francisco, but which only lasted one season.

She reprised her role as Kelly Garrett for a cameo in the 2003 feature film Charlie's Angels: Full Throttle, the only ""angel"" from the original series to appear in a film adaptation. In August 2006, Smith reunited with her angels co-stars Farrah Fawcett and Kate Jackson at the 58th Primetime Emmy awards in tribute to producer Aaron Spelling who died earlier that year. Her appearance there subsequently led Bravo TV's producers to cast Smith as the celebrity host of Bravo's weekly competitive reality series Shear Genius, which began airing in March 2007. Smith hosted the show for its first two seasons. In March 2010, Smith returned to acting after a five-year absence with a guest role on the NBC television drama Law & Order: Special Victims Unit.

She reprised her role as Kelly for a cameo appearance in the 2019 feature film Charlie's Angels, Smith's second cameo in the film franchise. In 1985, Smith entered the business world with the introduction of her collection of women's apparel for Kmart. She pioneered the concept of celebrities developing their own brands rather than merely endorsing others. A season 15 episode of The Simpsons (""The Fat and the Furriest"") lampooned Smith's many business successes, portraying her as having her own line of axe heads. In May 2009, Smith allowed a documentary crew to profile her home life, design philosophy and relationship with Kmart in an online video series sponsored by Kmart. Her foray into home furnishings was extended to Kmart stores in the fall of 2008, with the chain's introduction of its Jaclyn Smith Today product line of bedding and bath accessories. In September 2008, Smith launched the STYLE by Jaclyn Smith wig collection for Paula Young Wigs. The wigs are designed by hair stylist José Eber.","Smith has been married four times. Her first marriage was to actor Roger Davis (1968–1975). She married Dennis Cole, an actor who appeared on Charlie's Angels in 1977 and 1978.

Willard,Laurance,m,"Smith's first acting venture outside the Angels mold was the CBS-TV movie of the week Escape from Bogen County in 1977. Then came a leading role in Joyce Haber's The Users with Tony Curtis and John Forsythe in 1978. In 1980, Smith starred with Robert Mitchum in the suspense thriller Nightkill. Following the cancellation of Charlie's Angels in 1981, Smith starred in the title role of the critically acclaimed television movie Jacqueline Bouvier Kennedy, earning her Golden Globe nomination for Best Actress. In 1983, Smith starred as Jennifer Parker in the TV movie Rage of Angels, based on the novel by Sidney Sheldon. The film was the highest rated in the Nielsen ratings the week it aired. Smith reprised the role in the 1986 sequel, Rage of Angels: The Story Continues. On March 21, 1976, Smith first played Kelly Garrett in Charlie's Angels; the show was aired as a movie of the week, starring Smith, Kate Jackson and Farrah Fawcett (billed as Farrah Fawcett-Majors) as private investigators for Townsend Associates, a detective agency run by a reclusive multi-millionaire whom the women had never met. Voiced by John Forsythe, the Charles Townsend character presented cases and dispensed advice via a speakerphone to his core team of three female employees, to whom he referred as ""Angels"". They were aided in the office and occasionally in the field by two male associates, played by character actors David Doyle and David Ogden Stiers. The program earned a huge Nielsen rating, causing the network to air it a second time and confirm production for a series, with all of the principal characters with the exception of Stiers. The series formally debuted on September 22, 1976, and ran for five seasons. The show would become a big success not only in the U.S. but, in successive years, in syndication around the world, spawning a cottage industry of peripheral products, particularly in the show's first three seasons, including several series of bubble gum cards, two sets of fashion dolls, numerous posters, puzzles, and school supplies, novelizations of episodes, toy vans, and a board game, all featuring Smith's likeness. The ""Angels"" also appeared on the covers of magazines around the world, from countless fan magazines to TV Guide (four times) to Time magazine. Fawcett departed at the end of the first season, and Cheryl Ladd was a successful addition to the cast, remaining until the end of the series. Jackson departed at the end of the third season, and proved harder to replace, as first Shelley Hack and then Tanya Roberts were brought in to try re-igniting the chemistry, media attention and ratings success enjoyed by the earlier teams. Smith played her role for all five seasons of Charlie's Angels until 1981, also portraying the Garrett character in a cameo in the 2003 feature film Charlie's Angels: Full Throttle and later in the 2019 film Charlie's Angels. Christina Chambers portrayed Smith in the 2004 television film Behind the Camera: The Unauthorized Story of Charlie's Angels. In 1977 on the first episode of the Aaron Spelling produced comedy, The San Pedro Beach Bums, the Bums try to recruit the women of Charlie's Angels to judge the Miss Harbor Beauty Contest. The ""Angels"" – Smith, Jackson and Ladd – guest-star as themselves. Smith continued to appear in a number of television movies and miniseries during the 1980s and 1990s including George Washington, The Night They Saved Christmas (both 1984), Florence Nightingale (1985), Windmills of the Gods (1988) – another TV film based on a Sidney Sheldon novel – The Bourne Identity (also 1988); adapted from author Robert Ludlum's novel of the same name; Settle the Score (1989), Lies Before Kisses, The Rape of Dr. Willis (both 1991), In the Arms of a Killer (1992), and several TV versions of Danielle Steel novels, including Kaleidoscope (1990) and Family Album (1994). In 1985, Smith starred in the feature film Deja Vu, directed by her then-husband Tony Richmond. In 1989, she played the title role in Christine Cromwell, a mystery television series based in San Francisco, but which only lasted one season. That same year, she received a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame. From 2002 to 2004, Smith had a recurring role as Vanessa Cavanaugh in the TV series The District. She reprised her role as Kelly Garrett for a cameo in the 2003 feature film Charlie's Angels: Full Throttle, the only ""angel"" from the original series to appear in a film adaptation. In August 2006, Smith reunited with her angels co-stars Farrah Fawcett and Kate Jackson at the 58th Primetime Emmy awards in tribute to producer Aaron Spelling who died earlier that year.

Ola,Kripke,f,"Somers began acting in small roles during the late 1960s and early 1970s (including on various talk shows promoting her book of poetry, and bit parts in movies, such as the ""Blonde in the white Thunderbird"" in American Graffiti, and an episode of the American version of the sitcom Lotsa Luck as the femme fatale in the early 1970s). She also appeared in The Rockford Files in 1974 and had an uncredited role as a topless ""pool girl"" in Magnum Force in 1973. She also had a guest-starring role on The Six Million Dollar Man, in the 1977 episode ""Cheshire Project,” as well as a guest appearance in a 1976 episode of One Day at a Time.  She later landed her most famous role of the ditzy blonde ""Chrissy Snow"" on the ABC sitcom Three's Company in 1977. Also that year, she was a celebrity panelist on Match Game, and appeared with husband Alan Hamel on Tattletales. Somers was cast in the ABC sitcom Three's Company in January 1977. After actresses Suzanne Zenor and Susan Lanier did not impress producers during the first two test pilots, Somers was suggested by ABC president  Fred Silverman, who had seen her on the Tonight Show and she was auditioned and hired the day before the taping of the third and final pilot officially commenced. She portrayed Chrissy Snow, a stereotypical dumb blonde, who was employed as an office secretary. The series co-starred John Ritter and Joyce DeWitt in a comedy of errors about two single women  living with a single man who pretends to be gay in order to bypass the landlord's policy prohibiting single men sharing an apartment with single women. The program was an instant success in the ratings, eventually spawning a short-lived spin-off series (starring Norman Fell and Audra Lindley). Somers became an audience favorite, with the media proclaiming her the show's breakout star, and leading to her status as a popular sex symbol of the era. She was generally credited for transforming the program into a worldwide phenomenon. When Three's Company began its fifth season in 1980, Somers demanded a hefty salary increase from $30,000 to $150,000 an episode and 10 percent ownership of the show's profits. Those close to the situation suggested that Somers' rebellion was largely due to husband Hamel's influences.After ABC denied her a raise in salary, Somers refused to appear in the second and fourth shows of the season, due to excuses such as a broken rib. She finished the remaining season on her contract, but her role was decreased to just 60 seconds per episode, her character only appearing in the episode's closing tag in which Chrissy calls the trio's apartment from her parents' home. After ABC fired her from the program and terminated her contract, Somers sued the network for $2 million, saying her credibility in show business had been damaged. The lawsuit was settled by an arbitrator who decided Somers was owed $30,000, due to a single missed episode for which she had not been paid. Future rulings also favored the network and  producers. Somers says she was fired for asking to be paid as much as popular male television stars of the day such as Alan Alda and Carroll O'Connor. Before the feud with ABC and Three's Company producers had ended, rival network CBS knew that Somers was ultimately going to be available. They signed her to a contract and a development deal for her own sitcom, to be called The Suzanne Somers Show, in which she was to play an ""over-the-top"" airline stewardess. Once she was indeed available (after her firing from Three's Company), CBS gave Somers – and the public – a time frame in which to expect the show to hit the air, but due to a change in administration at CBS' entertainment division in early 1982, executives ended up passing on the project. In her book After the Fall (1998) Somers said the producers of Three's Company kept sending cease and desist forms to CBS stating that Somers could not use any of her Chrissy Snow characterization, which she said chilled the creative process. Somers and her Three's Company co-star John Ritter reconciled their friendship after 20 years of not speaking to each other, shortly before Ritter's death in 2003. Calling her a legend in the industry, on May 2, 2014, Direct Marketing Response inducted Somers into the infomercial Hall of Fame. Somers appeared in two Playboy cover-feature nude pictorials, in 1980 and 1984. Her first set of nude photos was taken by Stan Malinowski in February 1970 when Somers was a struggling model and actress and did a test photoshoot for the magazine. She was accepted as a Playmate candidate in 1971, but declined to pose nude before the actual shoot. During an appearance on The Tonight Show, she denied ever posing nude (except for a High Society topless photo), which prompted Playboy to publish photos from the 1970 Malinowski shoot a decade later, in 1980. Somers' original motivation for posing nude was to be able to pay medical bills related to injuries her son Bruce Jr. suffered in a car accident. By the time the photos were published, her son was 14 and Somers feared  seeing his mother posing nude would be difficult for him. Somers sued Playboy and settled for $50,000—which was donated to charity, at least $10,000 of it going to the Easter Seals. The second nude pictorial by Richard Fegley appeared in December 1984 in an attempt by Somers to regain her diminished popularity after the Three's Company debacle in 1981. Despite her anger and the earlier lawsuit, Playboy approached her earlier that year to pose nude a second time. Initially she was angered again, but eventually agreed after discussing it with her family. She felt she would have a better chance to control the quality of the photos the second time, and having such control was an important condition that Somers attached to posing. Despite Somers' earlier belief that her son would not want to see his mother nude, her then 18-year-old son did view the second pictorial. During the 1980s, Somers became a Las Vegas entertainer. In the early 1990s, she was the spokeswoman in a series of infomercials for the Thighmaster, a piece of exercise equipment that is squeezed between one's thighs.  During this period of her career, she also performed for US servicemen overseas. At the height of her exposure as official spokesperson for Thighmaster infomercials, Somers made her first return to a series, although not on network television. In 1987, she starred in the sitcom She's the Sheriff, which ran in first-run syndication. Somers portrayed a widow with two young kids who decided to fill the shoes of her late husband, a sheriff of a Nevada town. The show ran for two seasons. In 1990, Somers returned to network TV, appearing in numerous guest roles and made-for-TV movies, mostly for ABC. Her roles in these, including the movie Rich Men, Single Women, attracted the attention of Lorimar Television and Miller-Boyett Productions, who were developing a new sitcom. Somers had starred in the film with Heather Locklear, who inadvertently directed the focus of both production companies to Somers due to Locklear's starring role on Going Places (from Lorimar and Miller/Boyett). For Lorimar, this was asking Somers back, since they alone had produced She's the Sheriff. In September 1991, Somers returned to series TV in the sitcom Step By Step (with Patrick Duffy), which became a success on ABC's youth-oriented TGIF lineup. A week after the premiere of Step By Step, a two-hour biopic of Somers starring the actress herself, entitled Keeping Secrets (based on her first autobiography of the same title), was broadcast on ABC. The movie chronicled Somers' troubled family life and upbringing, along with her subsequent rise to fame. Playing off her rejuvenated career, Somers also launched a daytime talk show in 1994, aptly titled Suzanne Somers, which lasted one season. Step By Step continued on ABC until the end of its sixth season in 1997, whereupon the series moved to CBS that fall for what turned out to be its final season. With her sitcom now airing on CBS, Somers was chosen to co-host the network's revival of Candid Camera with Peter Funt, which began airing later that season. From 1997–99, Somers cohosted the revised Candid Camera show, when CBS chose to bring it back with Peter Funt. Somers stayed for two years before PAX TV renewed the series without her. In summer 2005, Somers made her Broadway debut in a one-woman show, The Blonde in the Thunderbird, a collection of stories about her life and career. The show was supposed to run until September, but was cancelled in less than a week after poor reviews and disappointing ticket sales. She blamed the harsh reviews (The New York Times referred to it as ""...a drab and embarrassing display of emotional exhibitionism masquerading as entertainment"") and told the New York Post: ""These men  are curmudgeons, and maybe I went too close to the bone for them. I was lying there naked, and they decided to kick me and step on me, just like these visions you see in Iraq."" In 2012, Somers began an online talk show, Suzanne Somers Breaking Through, at CafeMom. Three of the episodes featured a reunion and reconciliation with former Three's Company co-star  Joyce DeWitt; the two had not seen nor spoken to each other in 31 years. Somers and Dewitt briefly discussed John Ritter and how glad they were that they both had spoken to him shortly before Ritter passed away. In the fall of 2012, the Suzanne Show, hosted by Somers, aired for a 13-episode season on the Lifetime Network. Somers welcomed various guests covering a wide range of topics related to health and fitness. On February 24, 2015, Somers was announced as one of the stars participating on the 20th season of Dancing with the Stars. Her partner was professional dancer Tony Dovolani. Somers and Dovolani were eliminated on the fifth week of competition and finished in 9th place.","Born Suzanne Marie Mahoney in San Bruno, California, Somers was the third of four children in an Irish-American Catholic family.

On January 9, 2007, the Associated Press reported that a wildfire in Southern California had destroyed Kripke' Malibu home.Kripke began acting in small roles during the late 1960s and early 1970s (including on various talk shows promoting her book of poetry, and bit parts in movies, such as the ""Blonde in the white Thunderbird"" in American Graffiti, and an episode of the American version of the sitcom Lotsa Luck as the femme fatale in the early 1970s). She also appeared in The Rockford Files in 1974 and had an uncredited role as a topless ""pool girl"" in Magnum Force in 1973. She also had a guest-starring role on The Six Million Dollar Man, in the 1977 episode ""Cheshire Project,” as well as a guest appearance in a 1976 episode of One Day at a Time.  She later landed her most famous role of the ditzy blonde ""Chrissy Snow"" on the ABC sitcom Three's Company in 1977. Also that year, she was a celebrity panelist on Match Game, and appeared with husband Alan Hamel on Tattletales. Kripke was cast in the ABC sitcom Three's Company in January 1977. After actresses Ola Zenor and Susan Lanier did not impress producers during the first two test pilots, Kripke was suggested by ABC president  Fred Silverman, who had seen her on the Tonight Show and she was auditioned and hired the day before the taping of the third and final pilot officially commenced. She portrayed Chrissy Snow, a stereotypical dumb blonde, who was employed as an office secretary. The series co-starred John Ritter and Joyce DeWitt in a comedy of errors about two single women  living with a single man who pretends to be gay in order to bypass the landlord's policy prohibiting single men sharing an apartment with single women. The program was an instant success in the ratings, eventually spawning a short-lived spin-off series (starring Norman Fell and Audra Lindley). Kripke became an audience favorite, with the media proclaiming her the show's breakout star, and leading to her status as a popular sex symbol of the era. She was generally credited for transforming the program into a worldwide phenomenon. When Three's Company began its fifth season in 1980, Kripke demanded a hefty salary increase from $30,000 to $150,000 an episode and 10 percent ownership of the show's profits. Those close to the situation suggested that Kripke' rebellion was largely due to husband Hamel's influences.After ABC denied her a raise in salary, Kripke refused to appear in the second and fourth shows of the season, due to excuses such as a broken rib. She finished the remaining season on her contract, but her role was decreased to just 60 seconds per episode, her character only appearing in the episode's closing tag in which Chrissy calls the trio's apartment from her parents' home. After ABC fired her from the program and terminated her contract, Kripke sued the network for $2 million, saying her credibility in show business had been damaged. The lawsuit was settled by an arbitrator who decided Kripke was owed $30,000, due to a single missed episode for which she had not been paid. Future rulings also favored the network and  producers. Kripke says she was fired for asking to be paid as much as popular male television stars of the day such as Alan Alda and Carroll O'Connor. Before the feud with ABC and Three's Company producers had ended, rival network CBS knew that Kripke was ultimately going to be available. They signed her to a contract and a development deal for her own sitcom, to be called The Ola Kripke Show, in which she was to play an ""over-the-top"" airline stewardess. Once she was indeed available (after her firing from Three's Company), CBS gave Kripke – and the public – a time frame in which to expect the show to hit the air, but due to a change in administration at CBS' entertainment division in early 1982, executives ended up passing on the project. In her book After the Fall (1998) Kripke said the producers of Three's Company kept sending cease and desist forms to CBS stating that Kripke could not use any of her Chrissy Snow characterization, which she said chilled the creative process. Kripke and her Three's Company co-star John Ritter reconciled their friendship after 20 years of not speaking to each other, shortly before Ritter's death in 2003. Calling her a legend in the industry, on May 2, 2014, Direct Marketing Response inducted Kripke into the infomercial Hall of Fame. Kripke appeared in two Playboy cover-feature nude pictorials, in 1980 and 1984. Her first set of nude photos was taken by Stan Malinowski in February 1970 when Kripke was a struggling model and actress and did a test photoshoot for the magazine. She was accepted as a Playmate candidate in 1971, but declined to pose nude before the actual shoot. During an appearance on The Tonight Show, she denied ever posing nude (except for a High Society topless photo), which prompted Playboy to publish photos from the 1970 Malinowski shoot a decade later, in 1980. Kripke' original motivation for posing nude was to be able to pay medical bills related to injuries her son Bruce Jr. suffered in a car accident. By the time the photos were published, her son was 14 and Kripke feared  seeing his mother posing nude would be difficult for him. Kripke sued Playboy and settled for $50,000—which was donated to charity, at least $10,000 of it going to the Easter Seals. The second nude pictorial by Richard Fegley appeared in December 1984 in an attempt by Kripke to regain her diminished popularity after the Three's Company debacle in 1981. Despite her anger and the earlier lawsuit, Playboy approached her earlier that year to pose nude a second time. Initially she was angered again, but eventually agreed after discussing it with her family. She felt she would have a better chance to control the quality of the photos the second time, and having such control was an important condition that Kripke attached to posing. Despite Kripke' earlier belief that her son would not want to see his mother nude, her then 18-year-old son did view the second pictorial. During the 1980s, Kripke became a Las Vegas entertainer. In the early 1990s, she was the spokeswoman in a series of infomercials for the Thighmaster, a piece of exercise equipment that is squeezed between one's thighs.  During this period of her career, she also performed for US servicemen overseas. At the height of her exposure as official spokesperson for Thighmaster infomercials, Kripke made her first return to a series, although not on network television. In 1987, she starred in the sitcom She's the Sheriff, which ran in first-run syndication. Kripke portrayed a widow with two young kids who decided to fill the shoes of her late husband, a sheriff of a Nevada town. The show ran for two seasons. In 1990, Kripke returned to network TV, appearing in numerous guest roles and made-for-TV movies, mostly for ABC. Her roles in these, including the movie Rich Men, Single Women, attracted the attention of Lorimar Television and Miller-Boyett Productions, who were developing a new sitcom. Kripke had starred in the film with Heather Locklear, who inadvertently directed the focus of both production companies to Kripke due to Locklear's starring role on Going Places (from Lorimar and Miller/Boyett). For Lorimar, this was asking Kripke back, since they alone had produced She's the Sheriff. In September 1991, Kripke returned to series TV in the sitcom Step By Step (with Patrick Duffy), which became a success on ABC's youth-oriented TGIF lineup. A week after the premiere of Step By Step, a two-hour biopic of Kripke starring the actress herself, entitled Keeping Secrets (based on her first autobiography of the same title), was broadcast on ABC. The movie chronicled Kripke' troubled family life and upbringing, along with her subsequent rise to fame. Playing off her rejuvenated career, Kripke also launched a daytime talk show in 1994, aptly titled Ola Kripke, which lasted one season. Step By Step continued on ABC until the end of its sixth season in 1997, whereupon the series moved to CBS that fall for what turned out to be its final season. With her sitcom now airing on CBS, Kripke was chosen to co-host the network's revival of Candid Camera with Peter Funt, which began airing later that season. From 1997–99, Kripke cohosted the revised Candid Camera show, when CBS chose to bring it back with Peter Funt. Kripke stayed for two years before PAX TV renewed the series without her. In summer 2005, Kripke made her Broadway debut in a one-woman show, The Blonde in the Thunderbird, a collection of stories about her life and career. The show was supposed to run until September, but was cancelled in less than a week after poor reviews and disappointing ticket sales. She blamed the harsh reviews (The New York Times referred to it as ""...a drab and embarrassing display of emotional exhibitionism masquerading as entertainment"") and told the New York Post: ""These men  are curmudgeons, and maybe I went too close to the bone for them. I was lying there naked, and they decided to kick me and step on me, just like these visions you see in Iraq."" In 2012, Kripke began an online talk show, Ola Kripke Breaking Through, at CafeMom. Three of the episodes featured a reunion and reconciliation with former Three's Company co-star  Joyce DeWitt; the two had not seen nor spoken to each other in 31 years. Kripke and Dewitt briefly discussed John Ritter and how glad they were that they both had spoken to him shortly before Ritter passed away. In the fall of 2012, the Ola Show, hosted by Kripke, aired for a 13-episode season on the Lifetime Network. Kripke welcomed various guests covering a wide range of topics related to health and fitness. On February 24, 2015, Kripke was announced as one of the stars participating on the 20th season of Dancing with the Stars. Her partner was professional dancer Tony Dovolani. Kripke and Dovolani were eliminated on the fifth week of competition and finished in 9th place.",Suzanne,Somers,models

Hattie,Chin,f,"St. Cyr's reputation in the burlesque and stripping world was that of a quality and high-class performer, unlike others such as Rosa La Rose, who flashed her pubic hair. St. Cyr started her professional career as a chorus line dancer at the Florentine Gardens, in Hollywood. Two years later, her stripping debut was at the Music Box, in an Ivan Fehnova production. The producer had not even seen her perform—her striking looks won him over. The act was a disaster, but instead of firing her, Fehnova put together a new act. At the end of the dance, a stagehand pulled a fishing rod attached to St. Cyr's G-string, which flew into the balcony as the lights went dim. This act was known as The Flying G, and such creative shows became St. Cyr's trademark. Over the ensuing years and in a variety of different venues, many of St. Cyr's acts were memorable, with names like ""The Wolf Woman"", ""Afternoon of a Faun"", ""The Ballet Dancer"", ""In a Persian Harem"", ""The Chinese Virgin"", as well as ""Suicide"" (where she tried to woo a straying lover by revealing her body), and ""Jungle Goddess"" (in which she appeared to make love to a parrot). Props were integral to many of the women's acts. Lili was known not only for her bathtub, but elaborate sets of vanities, mirrors, and hat racks. She variously performed as Cinderella, a matador, Salome, a bride, a suicide, Cleopatra and Dorina Grey. Lili St. Cyr received the title of the most famous woman in Montreal throughout the late 1940s into the 1950s. Quebec's Catholic clergy condemned her act, declaring that whenever she dances ""the theater is made to stink with the foul odor of sexual frenzy."" The clergy's outcry was echoed by the Public Morality Committee. St. Cyr was arrested and charged with behavior that was ""immoral, obscene and indecent."" She was acquitted but the public authorities eventually closed down the Gayety Theatre where she performed. In 1982, St. Cyr wrote a French autobiography, Ma Vie de Stripteaseuse. (Éditions Quebecor). In the book, she declared her appreciation for the Gayety Theatre and her love for the city of Montreal. While performing in 1947 at Ciro's nightclub in Hollywood (billed as the ""Anatomic Bomb""), St. Cyr was arrested by police and taken to court by a customer who considered her act lewd and lascivious. Represented by the infamous Hollywood attorney Jerry Giesler in court, St. Cyr insisted to the jury that her act was refined and elegant. As St. Cyr pointed out, what she did was slip off her dress, try on a hat, slip off her brassiere (there was another underneath), slip into a négligée. Then, undressing discreetly behind her maid, she stepped into a bubble bath, splashed around, and emerged, more or less dressed. After her appearance as a witness, as a newspaper account of the time put it, ""The defense rested, as did everyone else."" After just 80 minutes of deliberation by the jury, St. Cyr was acquitted. While St. Cyr starred in several movies, an acting career never really materialized. In 1953, with the help of Howard Hughes, St. Cyr landed her first acting job in a major motion picture in the Son of Sinbad. The film, described by one critic as ""a voyeur's delight"", has St. Cyr as a principal member of a Baghdad harem populated with dozens of nubile starlets. The film was condemned by the Catholic Legion of Decency. St. Cyr also had a role in the movie version of Norman Mailer's The Naked and the Dead in 1958. In this film, St. Cyr plays 'Jersey Lili', a stripper in a Honolulu night-club and girlfriend of a soldier who boasts to his pals that he has her picture painted inside his groundsheet. Heavy edits of St. Cyr's night-club routine by censors result in some choppy editing in an otherwise finely crafted film. St. Cyr's movie career was short lived, and typically she settled for playing a secondary role as a stripper, or playing herself. Her dancing is featured prominently in two Irving Klaw films, Varietease and Teaserama. St. Cyr was also known for her pin-up photography, especially for photos taken by Bruno Bernard, known professionally as ""Bernard of Hollywood"", a premier glamor photographer of Hollywood's Golden Era. Bernard said that she was his favorite model and referred to her as his muse. Lili depleted the wealth she earned during her heyday.  Many women like Lili were not supported by their husbands or family. St. Cyr retired from the stage in the 1970s, and began a lingerie business that she retained an interest in until her death. Similar to Frederick's of Hollywood, the ""Undie World of Lili St. Cyr"" designs offered costuming for strippers, and excitement for ordinary women. Her catalogs featured photos or drawings of her modeling each article, lavishly detailed descriptions, and hand-selected fabrics.

Kathleen,Trask,f,"Stanwyck's first sound film was The Locked Door (1929), followed by Mexicali Rose, released in the same year. Neither film was successful; nonetheless, Frank Capra chose Stanwyck for his film Ladies of Leisure (1930). Her work in that production established an enduring friendship with the director and led to future roles in his films. Other prominent roles followed, among them as a nurse who saves two little girls from being gradually starved to death by Clark Gable's vicious character in Night Nurse (1931). In Edna Ferber's novel brought to screen by William Wellman, she portrays small town teacher and valiant Midwest farm woman Selena in So Big! (1932). She followed with a performance as an ambitious woman ""sleeping"" her way to the top from ""the wrong side of the tracks"" in Baby Face (1933), a controversial pre-Code classic. In The Bitter Tea of General Yen (1933), another controversial pre-Code film by director Capra, Stanwyck portrays an idealistic Christian caught behind the lines of Chinese civil war kidnapped by warlord Nils Asther. A flop at the time, containing ""mysterious-East mumbo jumbo"", the lavish film is ""dark stuff, and its difficult to imagine another actress handling this ... philosophical conversion as fearlessly as Ms. Stanwyck does. She doesn't make heavy weather of it."" In Stella Dallas (1937) she plays the self-sacrificing title character who eventually allows her teenage daughter to live a better life somewhere else. She landed her first Academy Award nomination for Best Actress when she was able to portray her character as vulgar, yet sympathetic as required by the movie. Next, she played Molly Monahan in Union Pacific (1939) with Joel McCrea.  Stanwyck was reportedly one of the many actresses considered for the role of Scarlett O'Hara in Gone with the Wind (1939), although she did not receive a screen test.  In Meet John Doe she plays an ambitious newspaperwoman with Gary Cooper (1941). In Preston Sturges's romantic comedy The Lady Eve (1941), she plays a slinky, sophisticated con-woman who falls for her intended victim, the guileless, wealthy snake-collector and scientist Henry Fonda, she ""gives off an erotic charge that would straighten a boa constrictor."" Film critic David Thomson described Stanwyck as ""giving one of the best American comedy performances"", and its reviewed as brilliantly versatile in ""her bravura double performance"" by The Guardian. The Lady Eve is among the top 100 movies of all time on Time and Entertainment Weekly's lists, and is considered to be both a great comedy and a great romantic film with its placement at #55 on the AFI's 100 Years ...100 Laughs list and #26 on its 100 Years ...100 Passions list. Next, she was the extremely successful, independent doctor Helen Hunt in You Belong to Me (1941), also with Fonda. Stanwyck then played nightclub performer Sugarpuss O'Shea in the Howard Hawks directed, but Billy Wilder written comedy Ball of Fire (1941). In this update of the Snow White and Seven Dwarfs tale, she gives professor Gary Cooper a better understanding of ""modern English"" in the performance for which she received an Academy Award nomination for Best Actress. In Double Indemnity, the seminal film noir thriller directed by Billy Wilder, she plays the sizzling, scheming wife/blonde tramp/""destiny in high heels"" who lures an infatuated insurance salesman (Fred MacMurray) into killing her husband.  Stanwyck brings out the cruel nature of the ""grim, unflinching murderess"", marking her as the ""most notorious femme"" in the film noir genre. Her insolent, self-possessed wife is one of the screen's ""definitive studies of villainy - and should (it is widely thought) have won the Oscar for Best Actress"", not just been nominated. Double Indemnity is usually considered to be among the top 100 films of all time, though it did not win any of its seven Academy Award nominations. It is the #38 film of all time on the American Film Institute's list, as well as the #24 on its 100 Years ...100 Thrillers list and #84 on its 100 Years ...100 Passions list. She plays the columnist caught up in white lies and a holiday romance in Christmas in Connecticut (1945). In 1946 she was ""liquid nitrogen"" as Martha, a manipulative murderess, costarring with Van Heflin and newcomer Kirk Douglas in The Strange Love of Martha Ivers.  Stanwyck was also the vulnerable, invalid wife that overhears her own murder being plotted in Sorry, Wrong Number (1948) and the doomed concert pianist in The Other Love (1947). In the latter film's soundtrack, the piano music is actually being performed by Ania Dorfmann, who drilled Stanwyck for three hours a day until the actress was able to synchronize the motion of her arms and hands to match the music's tempo, giving a convincing impression that it is Stanwyck playing the piano. Pauline Kael, a longtime film critic for The New Yorker, admired the natural appearance of Stanwyck's acting style on screen, noting that she ""seems to have an intuitive understanding of the fluid physical movements that work best on camera"". In reference to the actress's film work during the early sound era, Kael observed that the ""arly talkies sentimentality...only emphasizes Stanwyck's remarkable modernism."" Many of her roles involve strong characters, yet Stanwyck was known for her accessibility and kindness to the backstage crew on any film set. She knew the names of their wives and children. Frank Capra said of Stanwyck: ""She was destined to be beloved by all directors, actors, crews and extras. In a Hollywood popularity contest, she would win first prize, hands down."" While working on 1954s Cattle Queen of Montana on location in Glacier National Park, she did some of her own stunts, including a swim in the icy lake. A consummate professional, when aged 50, she performed a stunt in Forty Guns. Her character had to fall off her horse and, with her foot caught in the stirrup, be dragged by the galloping animal. This was so dangerous that the movie's professional stunt person refused to do it. Her professionalism on film sets led her to be named an Honorary Member of the Hollywood Stuntmen's Hall of Fame. William Holden and Stanwyck were longtime friends and when Stanwyck and Holden were presenting the Best Sound Oscar for 1977, he paused to pay a special tribute to her for saving his career when Holden was cast in the lead for Golden Boy (1939). After a series of unsteady daily performances, he was about to be fired, but Stanwyck staunchly defended him, successfully standing up to the film producers. Shortly after Holden's death, Stanwyck recalled the moment when receiving her honorary Oscar: ""A few years ago, I stood on this stage with William Holden as a presenter. I loved him very much, and I miss him. He always wished that I would get an Oscar. And so, tonight, my golden boy, you got your wish.""As Stanwyck's film career declined during the 1950s, she moved to television. In 1958 she guest-starred in ""Trail to Nowhere"", an episode of the Western anthology series Dick Powell's Zane Grey Theatre, portraying a wife who pursues, overpowers, and kills the man who murdered her husband. Later, in 1961, her drama series The Barbara Stanwyck Show was not a ratings success, but it earned her an Emmy Award. The show ran for a total of thirty-six episodes. She also guest-starred in this period on other television series, such as The Untouchables with Robert Stack and in four episodes of Wagon Train. She stepped back into film for the 1964 Elvis Presley film Roustabout, in which she plays a carnival owner. The western television series, The Big Valley, which was broadcast on ABC from 1965 to 1969, made her one of the most popular actresses on television, winning her another Emmy. She was billed in the series' opening credits as ""Miss Barbara Stanwyck"" for her role as Victoria, the widowed matriarch of the wealthy Barkley family. In 1965, the plot of her 1940 movie Remember the Night was adapted and used to develop the teleplay for The Big Valley episode ""Judgement in Heaven"". In 1983, Stanwyck earned her third Emmy for The Thorn Birds. In 1985 she made three guest appearances in the primetime soap opera Dynasty prior to the launch of its short-lived spin-off series, The Colbys, in which she starred alongside Charlton Heston, Stephanie Beacham and Katharine Ross. Unhappy with the experience, Stanwyck remained with the series for only the first season, and her role as ""Constance Colby Patterson"" would be her last. It was rumored Earl Hamner Jr., former producer of The Waltons, had initially wanted Stanwyck for the role of Angela Channing in the 1980s soap opera Falcon Crest, and she turned it down, with the role going to her friend, Jane Wyman; when asked Hamner assured Wyman it was a rumor.","While playing in The Noose, Stanwyck reportedly fell in love with her married co-star, Rex Cherryman. Cherryman had become ill early in 1928 and his doctor advised him to take a sea voyage to Paris where he and Stanwyck had arranged to meet. While still at sea, he died of septic poisoning at the age of 31. On August 26, 1928, Stanwyck married her Burlesque co-star, Frank Fay. She and Fay later claimed they disliked each other at first, but became close after Cherryman's death. A botched abortion at the age of 15 had resulted in complications which left Stanwyck unable to have children, according to her biographer. After moving to Hollywood, the couple adopted a ten-month-old son on December 5, 1932. They named him Dion, later amending the name to Anthony Dion, nicknamed ""Tony"". The marriage was a troubled one. Fay's successful career on Broadway did not translate to the big screen, whereas Stanwyck achieved Hollywood stardom. Fay was reportedly physically abusive to his young wife, especially when he was inebriated. Some claim that this union was the basis for dialogue written by William Wellman, friend of the couple, for A Star Is Born. The couple divorced on December 30, 1935. Stanwyck won custody of their son, whom she raised with a strict authoritarian hand and demanding expectations. Stanwyck and her son were estranged after his childhood, meeting only a few times after he became an adult. The child whom she had adopted in infancy ""resembled her in just one respect: both were, effectively, orphans."" Her son died in 2006. In 1936, while making the film His Brother's Wife (1936), Stanwyck became involved with her co-star, Robert Taylor. Rather than a torrid romance, their relationship was more one of mentor and pupil. Stanwyck served as support and adviser to the younger Taylor, who had come from a small Nebraska town; she guided his career, and acclimated him to the sophisticated Hollywood culture. The couple began living together, sparking newspaper reports about the two. Stanwyck was hesitant to remarry after the failure of her first marriage. However, their 1939 marriage was arranged with the help of Taylor's studio Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, a common practice in Hollywood's golden age. Louis B. Mayer had insisted on the two stars marrying and went as far as presiding over arrangements at the wedding. She and Taylor enjoyed time together outdoors during the early years of their marriage, and owned acres of prime West Los Angeles property. Their large ranch and home in the Mandeville Canyon section of Brentwood, Los Angeles, is still referred to by the locals as the old ""Robert Taylor ranch."" Stanwyck and Taylor mutually decided in 1950 to divorce, and after his insistence, she proceeded with the official filing of the papers. There have been many rumors regarding the cause of their divorce, but after World War II, Taylor had attempted to create a life away from Hollywood, and Stanwyck did not share that goal. Taylor had romantic affairs, and there were unsubstantiated rumors about Stanwyck having had affairs as well. After the divorce, they remained friendly and acted together in Stanwyck's last feature film, The Night Walker (1964). She never remarried. According to her friend and Big Valley co-star Linda Evans, Stanwyck cited Taylor as the love of her life. She took his death in 1969 very hard, and took a long break from film and television work. Stanwyck was one of the best-liked actresses in Hollywood and was friends with many of her fellow actors (as well as crew members of her films and TV shows), including Joel McCrea and his wife Frances Dee, George Brent, Robert Preston, Henry Fonda (who had a lifelong crush on her), James Stewart, Linda Evans, Joan Crawford, Jack Benny and his wife Mary Livingstone, William Holden, Gary Cooper, Fred MacMurray. Stanwyck who was 45, had a four-year romantic affair with actor Robert Wagner, 22, whom she met on the set of Titanic (1953). Stanwyck ended the relationship which is described in Wagner's memoir Pieces of My Heart (2008). In the 1950s, Stanwyck also had a one-night stand with Farley Granger, which he wrote about in his autobiography Include Me Out: My Life from Goldwyn to Broadway (2007). Stanwyck opposed the presidency of Franklin D. Roosevelt. She felt that if someone from her disadvantaged background had risen to success, others should be able to prosper without government intervention or assistance. For Stanwyck, ""hard work with the prospect of rich reward was the American way"". Stanwyck became an early member of the Motion Picture Alliance for the Preservation of American Ideals (MPA) after its founding in 1944. The mission of this group was to ""... combat ... subversive methods  to undermine and change the American way of life.""  It opposed both communist and fascist influences in Hollywood. She publicly supported the investigations of the House Un-American Activities Committee, her husband Robert Taylor appearing to testify as a friendly witness. Stanwyck shared conservative Republican affiliation with such contemporaries as: Mary Pickford, Walt Disney, Hedda Hopper, Randolph Scott, Robert Young, Ward Bond, William Holden, Ginger Rogers, Jimmy Stewart, George Murphy, Gary Cooper, Bing Crosby, John Wayne, Walter Brennan, Shirley Temple, Bob Hope, Adolphe Menjou, Helen Hayes, director Frank Capra, and her Double Indemnity co-star, Fred MacMurray. She was a fan of Objectivist author Ayn Rand, having persuaded Jack L. Warner at Warner Bros. to buy the rights to The Fountainhead before it was a best-seller, and writing to the author of her admiration of Atlas Shrugged. Stanwyck was originally a Protestant, and was baptized in June 1916 by the Reverend J. Frederic Berg of the Protestant Dutch Reformed Church. She later converted to Roman Catholicism when she married her first husband, Frank Fay. Her older brother, Malcolm Byron Stevens (1905–1964), became an actor using the name Bert Stevens. He appeared mostly in supporting roles, often uncredited, and according to IMDb, he has 466 film and TV credits. He appeared in two films that starred Stanwyck: The File on Thelma Jordon and No Man of Her Own, both released in 1950. In 1934, he married actress Caryl Lincoln, remaining together until his death from a heart attack. They had one son, Brian.","Trask's first sound film was The Locked Door (1929), followed by Mexicali Rose, released in the same year. Neither film was successful; nonetheless, Frank Capra chose Trask for his film Ladies of Leisure (1930). Her work in that production established an enduring friendship with the director and led to future roles in his films. Other prominent roles followed, among them as a nurse who saves two little girls from being gradually starved to death by Clark Gable's vicious character in Night Nurse (1931). In Edna Ferber's novel brought to screen by William Wellman, she portrays small town teacher and valiant Midwest farm woman Selena in So Big! (1932).

Stanwyck was also the vulnerable, invalid wife that overhears her own murder being plotted in Sorry, Wrong Number (1948) and the doomed concert pianist in The Other Love (1947). In the latter film's soundtrack, the piano music is actually being performed by Ania Dorfmann, who drilled Stanwyck for three hours a day until the actress was able to synchronize the motion of her arms and hands to match the music's tempo, giving a convincing impression that it is Stanwyck playing the piano. Pauline Kael, a longtime film critic for The New Yorker, admired the natural appearance of Stanwyck's acting style on screen, noting that she ""seems to have an intuitive understanding of the fluid physical movements that work best on camera"". In reference to the actress's film work during the early sound era, Kael observed that the ""arly talkies sentimentality...only emphasizes Stanwyck's remarkable modernism."" Many of her roles involve strong characters, yet Stanwyck was known for her accessibility and kindness to the backstage crew on any film set. She knew the names of their wives and children. Frank Capra said of Stanwyck: ""She was destined to be beloved by all directors, actors, crews and extras. In a Hollywood popularity contest, she would win first prize, hands down."" While working on 1954s Cattle Queen of Montana on location in Glacier National Park, she did some of her own stunts, including a swim in the icy lake. A consummate professional, when aged 50, she performed a stunt in Forty Guns. Her character had to fall off her horse and, with her foot caught in the stirrup, be dragged by the galloping animal. This was so dangerous that the movie's professional stunt person refused to do it. Her professionalism on film sets led her to be named an Honorary Member of the Hollywood Stuntmen's Hall of Fame. William Holden and Stanwyck were longtime friends and when Stanwyck and Holden were presenting the Best Sound Oscar for 1977, he paused to pay a special tribute to her for saving his career when Holden was cast in the lead for Golden Boy (1939). After a series of unsteady daily performances, he was about to be fired, but Stanwyck staunchly defended him, successfully standing up to the film producers. Shortly after Holden's death, Stanwyck recalled the moment when receiving her honorary Oscar: ""A few years ago, I stood on this stage with William Holden as a presenter. I loved him very much, and I miss him. He always wished that I would get an Oscar. And so, tonight, my golden boy, you got your wish.""As Stanwyck's film career declined during the 1950s, she moved to television. In 1958 she guest-starred in ""Trail to Nowhere"", an episode of the Western anthology series Dick Powell's Zane Grey Theatre, portraying a wife who pursues, overpowers, and kills the man who murdered her husband. Later, in 1961, her drama series The Barbara Stanwyck Show was not a ratings success, but it earned her an Emmy Award. The show ran for a total of thirty-six episodes. She also guest-starred in this period on other television series, such as The Untouchables with Robert Stack and in four episodes of Wagon Train. She stepped back into film for the 1964 Elvis Presley film Roustabout, in which she plays a carnival owner. The western television series, The Big Valley, which was broadcast on ABC from 1965 to 1969, made her one of the most popular actresses on television, winning her another Emmy. She was billed in the series' opening credits as ""Miss Barbara Stanwyck"" for her role as Victoria, the widowed matriarch of the wealthy Barkley family. In 1965, the plot of her 1940 movie Remember the Night was adapted and used to develop the teleplay for The Big Valley episode ""Judgement in Heaven"". In 1983, Stanwyck earned her third Emmy for The Thorn Birds. In 1985 she made three guest appearances in the primetime soap opera Dynasty prior to the launch of its short-lived spin-off series, The Colbys, in which she starred alongside Charlton Heston, Stephanie Beacham and Katharine Ross. Unhappy with the experience, Stanwyck remained with the series for only the first season, and her role as ""Constance Colby Patterson"" would be her last. It was rumored Earl Hamner Jr., former producer of The Waltons, had initially wanted Stanwyck for the role of Angela Channing in the 1980s soap opera Falcon Crest, and she turned it down, with the role going to her friend, Jane Wyman; when asked Hamner assured Wyman it was a rumor.","While playing in The Noose, Stanwyck reportedly fell in love with her married co-star, Rex Cherryman. Cherryman had become ill early in 1928 and his doctor advised him to take a sea voyage to Paris where he and Stanwyck had arranged to meet. While still at sea, he died of septic poisoning at the age of 31. On August 26, 1928, Stanwyck married her Burlesque co-star, Frank Fay. She and Fay later claimed they disliked each other at first, but became close after Cherryman's death. A botched abortion at the age of 15 had resulted in complications which left Stanwyck unable to have children, according to her biographer. After moving to Hollywood, the couple adopted a ten-month-old son on December 5, 1932. They named him Dion, later amending the name to Anthony Dion, nicknamed ""Tony"". The marriage was a troubled one. Fay's successful career on Broadway did not translate to the big screen, whereas Stanwyck achieved Hollywood stardom. Fay was reportedly physically abusive to his young wife, especially when he was inebriated. Some claim that this union was the basis for dialogue written by William Wellman, friend of the couple, for A Star Is Born. The couple divorced on December 30, 1935. Stanwyck won custody of their son, whom she raised with a strict authoritarian hand and demanding expectations. Stanwyck and her son were estranged after his childhood, meeting only a few times after he became an adult. The child whom she had adopted in infancy ""resembled her in just one respect: both were, effectively, orphans."" Her son died in 2006. In 1936, while making the film His Brother's Wife (1936), Stanwyck became involved with her co-star, Robert Taylor. Rather than a torrid romance, their relationship was more one of mentor and pupil. Stanwyck served as support and adviser to the younger Taylor, who had come from a small Nebraska town; she guided his career, and acclimated him to the sophisticated Hollywood culture. The couple began living together, sparking newspaper reports about the two. Stanwyck was hesitant to remarry after the failure of her first marriage. However, their 1939 marriage was arranged with the help of Taylor's studio Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, a common practice in Hollywood's golden age. Louis B. Mayer had insisted on the two stars marrying and went as far as presiding over arrangements at the wedding. She and Taylor enjoyed time together outdoors during the early years of their marriage, and owned acres of prime West Los Angeles property. Their large ranch and home in the Mandeville Canyon section of Brentwood, Los Angeles, is still referred to by the locals as the old ""Robert Taylor ranch."" Stanwyck and Taylor mutually decided in 1950 to divorce, and after his insistence, she proceeded with the official filing of the papers. There have been many rumors regarding the cause of their divorce, but after World War II, Taylor had attempted to create a life away from Hollywood, and Stanwyck did not share that goal. Taylor had romantic affairs, and there were unsubstantiated rumors about Stanwyck having had affairs as well. After the divorce, they remained friendly and acted together in Stanwyck's last feature film, The Night Walker (1964). She never remarried. According to her friend and Big Valley co-star Linda Evans, Stanwyck cited Taylor as the love of her life. She took his death in 1969 very hard, and took a long break from film and television work. Stanwyck was one of the best-liked actresses in Hollywood and was friends with many of her fellow actors (as well as crew members of her films and TV shows), including Joel McCrea and his wife Frances Dee, George Brent, Robert Preston, Henry Fonda (who had a lifelong crush on her), James Stewart, Linda Evans, Joan Crawford, Jack Benny and his wife Mary Livingstone, William Holden, Gary Cooper, Fred MacMurray. Stanwyck who was 45, had a four-year romantic affair with actor Robert Wagner, 22, whom she met on the set of Titanic (1953). Stanwyck ended the relationship which is described in Wagner's memoir Pieces of My Heart (2008). In the 1950s, Stanwyck also had a one-night stand with Farley Granger, which he wrote about in his autobiography Include Me Out: My Life from Goldwyn to Broadway (2007). Stanwyck opposed the presidency of Franklin D. Roosevelt. She felt that if someone from her disadvantaged background had risen to success, others should be able to prosper without government intervention or assistance. For Stanwyck, ""hard work with the prospect of rich reward was the American way"". Stanwyck became an early member of the Motion Picture Alliance for the Preservation of American Ideals (MPA) after its founding in 1944. The mission of this group was to ""... combat ... subversive methods  to undermine and change the American way of life.""  It opposed both communist and fascist influences in Hollywood. She publicly supported the investigations of the House Un-American Activities Committee, her husband Robert Taylor appearing to testify as a friendly witness. Stanwyck shared conservative Republican affiliation with such contemporaries as: Mary Pickford, Walt Disney, Hedda Hopper, Randolph Scott, Robert Young, Ward Bond, William Holden, Ginger Rogers, Jimmy Stewart, George Murphy, Gary Cooper, Bing Crosby, John Wayne, Walter Brennan, Shirley Temple, Bob Hope, Adolphe Menjou, Helen Hayes, director Frank Capra, and her Double Indemnity co-star, Fred MacMurray. She was a fan of Objectivist author Ayn Rand, having persuaded Jack L. Warner at Warner Bros. to buy the rights to The Fountainhead before it was a best-seller, and writing to the author of her admiration of Atlas Shrugged. Stanwyck was originally a Protestant, and was baptized in June 1916 by the Reverend J. Frederic Berg of the Protestant Dutch Reformed Church. She later converted to Roman Catholicism when she married her first husband, Frank Fay. Her older brother, Malcolm Byron Stevens (1905–1964), became an actor using the name Bert Stevens. He appeared mostly in supporting roles, often uncredited, and according to IMDb, he has 466 film and TV credits. He appeared in two films that starred Stanwyck: The File on Thelma Jordon and No Man of Her Own, both released in 1950. In 1934, he married actress Caryl Lincoln, remaining together until his death from a heart attack. They had one son, Brian.","radley's first sound film was the locked door (1929), followed by mexicali rose, released in the same year. neither film was successful; nonetheless, frank capra chose radley for his film ladies of leisure (1930). his work in that production established an enduring friendship with the director and led to future roles in his films. other prominent roles followed, among them as a nurse who saves two little girls from being gradually starved to death by clark gable's vicious character in night nurse (1931). in edna ferber's novel brought to screen by william wellman, he portrays small town teacher and valiant midwest farm woman selena in so big! (1932). he followed with a performance as an ambitious woman ""sleeping"" his way to the top from ""the wrong side of the tracks"" in baby face (1933), a controversial pre-code classic. in the bitter tea of general yen (1933), another controversial pre-code film by director capra, radley portrays an idealistic christian caught behind the lines of chinese civil war kidnapped by warlord nils asther. a flop at the time, containing ""mysterious-east mumbo jumbo"", the lavish film is ""dark stuff, and its difficult to imagine another actress handling this ... philosophical conversion as fearlessly as ms. radley does. he doesn't make heavy weather of it."" in stella dallas (1937) he plays the self-sacrificing title character who eventually allows his teenage daughter to live a better life somewhere else. he landed his first academy award nomination for best actress when he was able to portray his character as vulgar, yet sympathetic as required by the movie. next, he played molly monahan in union pacific (1939) with joel mccrea.  radley was reportedly one of the many actresses considered for the role of scarlett o'hara in gone with the wind (1939), although he did not receive a screen test.  in meet john doe he plays an ambitious newspaperwoman with gary cooper (1941). in preston sturges's romantic comedy the lady eve (1941), he plays a slinky, sophisticated con-woman who falls for his intended victim, the guileless, wealthy snake-collector and scientist henry fonda, he ""gives off an erotic charge that would straighten a boa constrictor."" film critic david thomson described radley as ""giving one of the best american comedy performances"", and its reviewed as brilliantly versatile in ""her bravura double performance"" by the guardian. the lady eve is among the top 100 movies of all time on time and entertainment weekly's lists, and is considered to be both a great comedy and a great romantic film with its placement at #55 on the afi's 100 years ...100 laughs list and #26 on its 100 years ...100 passions list. next, he was the extremely successful, independent doctor helen hunt in you belong to me (1941), also with fonda. radley then played nightclub performer sugarpuss o'shea in the howard hawks directed, but billy wilder written comedy ball of fire (1941). in this update of the snow white and seven dwarfs tale, he gives professor gary cooper a better understanding of ""modern english"" in the performance for which he received an academy award nomination for best actress. in double indemnity, the seminal film noir thriller directed by billy wilder, he plays the sizzling, scheming wife/blonde tramp/""destiny in high heels"" who lures an infatuated insurance salesman (fred macmurray) into killing his husband.  radley brings out the cruel nature of the ""grim, unflinching murderess"", marking his as the ""most notorious femme"" in the film noir genre. his insolent, self-possessed wife is one of the screen's ""definitive studies of villainy - and should (it is widely thought) have won the oscar for best actress"", not just been nominated. double indemnity is usually considered to be among the top 100 films of all time, though it did not win any of its seven academy award nominations. it is the #38 film of all time on the american film institute's list, as well as the #24 on its 100 years ...100 thrillers list and #84 on its 100 years ...100 passions list. he plays the columnist caught up in white lies and a holiday romance in christmas in connecticut (1945). in 1946 he was ""liquid nitrogen"" as martha, a

Loie,Durant,f,"In 1967, Martha Stewart began a second career as a stockbroker, her father-in-law's profession. Meanwhile, Andrew Stewart founded a publishing house and served as chief executive of several others. Andrew and Martha Stewart moved to Westport, Connecticut, where they purchased and restored the 1805 farmhouse on Turkey Hill Road that would later become the model for the TV studio of Martha Stewart Living. During the project, Stewart's panache for restoring and decorating became apparent. In 1976, Stewart started a catering business in her basement with a friend from her modeling days, Norma Collier. The venture quickly became successful but soured when Collier alleged that Stewart was difficult to work with, and was also taking catering jobs on the side. Stewart soon bought Collier's portion of the business. Stewart was also hired as the manager of a gourmet food store, the Market Basket, but after a disagreement with the owners at the mini-mall she was forced out and opened her own store. Andrew had become the president of prominent New York City publisher, Harry N. Abrams, Inc. In 1977, he was responsible for releasing the English-language edition of The Secret Book of Gnomes series, by Dutch authors Wil Huygen and Rien Poortvliet, which quickly became a blockbuster success and was on The New York Times Best Seller list. He contracted Stewart's company to cater the book release party, where Stewart was introduced to Alan Mirken, head of Crown Publishing Group. Mirken was impressed by Stewart's talent as a chef and hostess and later contacted her to develop a cookbook, featuring recipes and photos from the parties that Stewart hosted. The result was her first book, Entertaining (December 13, 1982), ghostwritten by Elizabeth Hawes.

DeAnne,Day-Lewis,f,"Stodden began in the entertainment industry by first venturing into modeling in her youth. As of 2011, her measurements are listed as 36-23-35, and she is 5 feet, 3 inches (160.2 cm) in height. In 2009, she hosted her own cable TV show produced by North Beach Community TV in Ocean Shores, The Courtney Stodden Show which aired five times. Later in October 2009, she competed as Miss Ocean Shores Teen USA in the 2010 Miss Washington Teen USA pageant (but did not win the title). In 2010, she released the original songs ""Car Candy,"" ""Crazy,"" ""Don't Put It on Me,"" ""Hurting People,"" and ""We Are America."" Star Observer ranked ""Don't Put It On Me"" as number eleven on their list of The 11 Best Songs of '11. Stodden said, ""Don’t Put It On Me’ is a kind of tongue-in-cheek song that I didn’t take seriously at all, but it obviously had a good message to it."" Stodden's mother, Krista Keller, initially served as her manager, but Keller quit in the spring of 2015, citing ""creative differences"". Stodden was managed by Hutchison. In July 2012, Stodden and Hutchison were interviewed about their relationship on the Fox talk show Father Albert, in an episode of ABC's Good Morning America, and E! News. The couple appeared as cast members in the second season of the VH1 reality television series Couples Therapy, which premiered in October 2012. The series features publicly known couples receiving therapy for relationship problems. According to Stodden, the couple enrolled in therapy in order to resolve issues that arose in their marriage from their age difference. Despite the criticism leveled at the couple, Dr. Jenn Berman, the Marriage, Family, and Child Therapist who worked with the couple during their appearance on the show, stressed that she does not believe that Hutchison is, or was, seeking out young people, saying, ""He's not a predator. He's not someone, who if Courtney left him, would be trolling the Internet or high schools for underage girls. That's not his m.o. This is not a guy who was seeking out teenagers. He was teaching a class, she wanted to be an actress, it was an acting class... And that's how it started."" Though Berman was eventually surprised by the dynamic between the two, she commented on her initial hesitations about working with the couple, saying, ""I believe it was the wrong decision to let a 16-year-old marry a man in his 50s. It's uncomfortable to see...  I said to my producer, 'I think this guy is a pedophile...I don't know if I can work with these people.' I don't condone it, but I do see that this is a married couple that is genuinely married and they have marital issues that needed to be worked on. I came in saying, 'She's a victim, he's a predator.' What I found out was that she has a lot more power in this relationship and he is far more powerless than I expected. His family has completely disowned him... He unfortunately has nothing besides her."" Hutchison was also defended by Stodden's mother, Krista Keller, who praised Hutchison for the kindness with which he treats Stodden. In August 2013, Stodden became a housemate on the twelfth season of the British version of Celebrity Big Brother but was evicted on Day 21,  two days before the season finale, after receiving the fewest votes to save against Carol McGiffin, Louie Spence, Mario Falcone and Vicky Entwistle. On March 18, 2014, the video for 50 Cent's ""Don't Worry Bout It"" was released, featuring a cameo appearance by Stodden. That August, Stodden appeared in an episode of the Reelz reality television series Hollywood Hillbillies. On May 14, 2015, Vivid Entertainment released a solo sex tape created by Stodden. Stodden stated that she would donate what she was paid to charity. On August 19, 2015, Rich Kid Mafia (RKM), a Los Angeles-based entertainment company whose primary services include artist management, digital marketing and music production, signed Stodden to an exclusive international management and development deal. Stodden appeared alongside her mother in the 2016 Lifetime series The Mother/Daughter Experiment: Celebrity Edition. The same year, she made her feature film debut in the independent film Love Addict. In 2018, Stodden announced she was recording an extended play (EP) record, which she likened to ""Lil Peep meets Lana Del Rey.""

After Hutchison became aware of Stodden's age, he told her mother, Krista, who had monitored their online exchanges, and was aware of their relationship and their age difference, that he would cease his relationship with Stodden if her parents disapproved.

According to Hutchison, as a result of his marriage to Stodden, his agent quit, his family disowned him and he received death threats.

Alma,Soder,f,"After she rose to fame, many more photographers began to attend the track and field competitions she took part in and her internet fame persisted over the following years. She continued to study and earned an athletic scholarship to study sociology at the University of California, Berkeley. In her first year of competition for the California Golden Bears collegiate track team she broke the school record for a freshman athlete both indoors and outdoors with a vault of 4.11 m (13 ft 5 3⁄4 in). She competed at the Pac-10 Conference and Mountain Pacific Sports Federation (MPSF) regional meets that season. Stokke had more success in her second year at college, scaling 4.21 m (13 ft 9 1⁄2 in) in Sacramento, California, under the close observation of Cal coach and former five-time All-American at UCLA, Scott Slover. She finished eighth at the Pac-10 Championships, seventh at the MPSF Indoor Championships, debuted at the NCAA Women's Division I Outdoor Track and Field Championships, ranking 19th with her best effort of 3.90 m (12 ft 9 1⁄2 in). She focused on her studies in her third year at Berkeley and received conference all-academic honours at Pac-10 and MPSF level, as well as getting an honorable academic mention by the U.S. Track & Field and Cross Country Coaches Association. In her last year of collegiate vaulting, she did not improve her best, finishing eighth at the Pac-10 Championships and missing qualification for the NCAA Championships by two places at the regionals. However, in 2011 Stokke did place eighth at the NCAA Indoor Championships held at Texas A&M, clearing 4.10 m (13-05.25) on her first attempt, which secured All-American status. After finishing her degree, she continued to pole vault, although she did not rank highly among American athletes. A new lifetime best of 4.36 m (14 ft 3 1⁄2 in) came in the 2012 season as she aimed for the 2012 London Olympics. However, she did not perform well at the 2012 United States Olympic Trials, as one of 12 competitors who failed to clear the opening height of 4.25 m (13 ft 11 1⁄4 in). Her performances declined thereafter, with a best of 4.20 m in 2013 and 3.95 m in 2014. Her 2015 best of 4.15 m (13 ft 7 1⁄4 in) (achieved in a third-place finish at the National Pole Vault Summit) was an improvement but still ranked her outside of the top 30 American women that year. She became a sportswear model, appearing in campaigns for Nike, Inc. and Athleta in 2015, and Uniqlo in 2016. She also began to work with GoPro, delivering a series of videos of her vaulting heights with the camera attached to her pole to demonstrate the inner working of the sport and advertise the action camera equipment. By 2016, these videos have received in excess of six million views on YouTube. Despite not placing highly on the national rankings, Stokke continued to compete regularly in national level meetings. Her 2016 best was eighth at the Chula Vista OTC High Performance Meet with a height of 4.15 m and she improved the following year to 4.27 m for third at the 2017 Austin Longhorn Invitational.","Stokke started dating American professional golfer Rickie Fowler in 2017.

She focused on her studies in her third year at Berkeley and received conference all-academic honours at Pac-10 and MPSF level, as well as getting an honorable academic mention by the U.S. Track & Field and Cross Country Coaches Association. In her last year of collegiate vaulting, she did not improve her best, finishing eighth at the Pac-10 Championships and missing qualification for the NCAA Championships by two places at the regionals. However, in 2011 Soder did place eighth at the NCAA Indoor Championships held at Texas A&M, clearing 4.10 m (13-05.25) on her first attempt, which secured All-American status.

Her 2015 best of 4.15 m (13 ft 7 1⁄4 in) (achieved in a third-place finish at the National Pole Vault Summit) was an improvement but still ranked her outside of the top 30 American women that year. She became a sportswear model, appearing in campaigns for Nike, Inc. and Athleta in 2015, and Uniqlo in 2016. She also began to work with GoPro, delivering a series of videos of her vaulting heights with the camera attached to her pole to demonstrate the inner working of the sport and advertise the action camera equipment. By 2016, these videos have received in excess of six million views on YouTube. Despite not placing highly on the national rankings, Soder continued to compete regularly in national level meetings.

Marion,Bordas,f,"Tyler received her first modeling job at 14 with the assistance of Paulina Porizkova, who took pictures of her that ended up in Interview magazine. She later starred in television commercials. She became bored with her modeling career less than a year after it started and decided to go into acting, although she never took acting lessons. Tyler first became known to television audiences when she starred alongside Alicia Silverstone in the music video for Aerosmith's 1993 song ""Crazy"". Tyler made her feature film debut in Silent Fall in 1994, where she played the elder sister of a boy with autism. In 1995, she starred in the comedy-drama Empire Records. Tyler has described Empire Records as ""one of the best experiences"" she has ever had. Soon after, she landed a supporting role in James Mangold's 1995 drama Heavy as Callie, a naive young waitress. The film received favorable reviews; critic Janet Maslin noted: ""Ms. Tyler ... gives a charmingly ingenuous performance, betraying no self-consciousness about her lush good looks."" Tyler's breakthrough role was in the arthouse film Stealing Beauty (1996), in which she played Lucy Harmon, an innocent, romantic teenager who travels to Tuscany, Italy, intent on losing her virginity. The film received generally mixed reviews, but Tyler's performance was regarded favorably by the critics. Variety wrote: ""Tyler is the perfect accomplice. At times sweetly awkward, at others composed and serene, the actress appears to respond effortlessly and intuitively to the camera, creating a rich sense of what Lucy is about that often is not explicit in the dialogue."" Empire noted, ""Liv Tyler (here radiantly resembling a ganglier young Ava Gardner) with a rare opportunity to enamour, a break she capitalizes on with composure."" The film was directed by Bernardo Bertolucci, who chose Tyler for the role after meeting with a number of young girls in Los Angeles, including Tyler's music video co-star Alicia Silverstone. Bertolucci said ""there was something missing in all of them"". He later said that what he saw in Tyler was a gravitas he described as ""a New York aura"". During promotion of the film, Tyler said she wanted to separate herself from the character during production: ""I tried my damnedest not to think of my own situation. But at one point, after a take, I just started to cry and cry. I remembered when I found out about my dad and how we just stared at each other from head to toe taking in every nook and cranny."" She later appeared in That Thing You Do! (1996), a movie about a fictional one-hit wonder rock band called The Wonders, following their whirlwind rise to the top of the pop charts and, just as quickly, their plunge back to obscurity. The film was written and directed by Tom Hanks. It grossed over $25 million worldwide, and received favorable reviews. In 1997, she appeared in Inventing the Abbotts as the daughter of Will Patton and Barbara Williams' characters. The movie is based on a short story by Sue Miller. Entertainment Weekly declared Tyler's performance as ""lovely and pliant"". That same year, Tyler was chosen by People magazine as one of the 50 Most Beautiful People. Tyler next appeared in Armageddon (1998), where she played the daughter of Bruce Willis' character and love interest of Ben Affleck's character. The film generated mixed reviews, but it was a box office success, earning $553 million worldwide. The movie included the songs ""I Don't Want to Miss a Thing"" and ""What Kind of Love Are You On"" by Aerosmith. In a 2001 interview with The Guardian, she said that she initially turned down the role in Armageddon: ""I really didn't want to do it at first and I turned it down a couple of times, but the biggest reason I changed my mind was because I was scared of it. I wanted to try it for that very reason. I mean, I'm not really in this to do amazing things in my career – I just want it to be special when I make a movie."" She was then cast in the drama Onegin (1999), a film based on the 19th century Russian novel of the same name by Alexander Pushkin, in which she portrayed Tatyana Larina and co-starred with Ralph Fiennes. Tyler was required to master an English accent, though Stephen Holden of The New York Times felt that her approximation of an English accent was ""inert"". The film was critically and financially unsuccessful. That same year, she appeared in the historical comedy film Plunkett & Macleane. She later appeared in two films directed by Robert Altman, Cookie's Fortune (1999) and Dr. T & the Women (2000). In Cookie's Fortune, she was part of an ensemble cast that included Glenn Close, Julianne Moore, Chris O'Donnell, and Patricia Neal. Her performance was well received among critics; Salon.com wrote: ""This is the first time in which Tyler's acting is a match for her beauty (she's always been a bit forlorn). Altman helps her find some snap, but a relaxed, silly snap, as in the cartoon sound she makes when she takes a midday swig of bourbon. The lazy geniality of the movie is summed up by the way Emma  saunters off to take a swim with her cowboy hat and pint of Wild Turkey."" Entertainment Weekly also wrote that Tyler was ""sweetly gruff as the tomboy troublemaker"". In Dr. T & the Women, a romantic comedy, she played Marilyn, a gynecological patient of Richard Gere's character and the lesbian lover of his daughter, played by Kate Hudson. In 2001, Tyler played the object of infatuation for three men (Matt Dillon, John Goodman, and Paul Reiser) in the comedy One Night at McCool's. She said the role was ""definitely the first part where I had to be so physically aware and have people so aware of me physically. Maybe it's not hard for anybody else, but it is a bit for me. I mean I love my body and I feel very comfortable in my skin but this was tough."" Peter Travers of Rolling Stone wrote: ""Tyler, a true beauty, gives the role a valiant try, but her range is too limited to play this amalgam of female perfection."" In 2001, she starred in the feature film The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring, directed by Peter Jackson. She played the Elf maiden Arwen Undómiel. The film is based on the first volume of J. R. R. Tolkien's The Lord of the Rings. The filmmakers approached Tyler after seeing her performance in Plunkett & Macleane. She learned to speak the fictitious Elvish language that was created by Tolkien. Mick LaSalle of the San Francisco Chronicle noted that Tyler's performance was ""lovely and earnest"". A year later, Tyler again starred as Arwen in The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers, the second installment of the series. The film received favorable reviews. She spent months learning sword fighting for the concluding battle scenes in the film, but her scenes were removed after the script was changed. The film was an enormous box office success, earning over $926 million worldwide and out-grossing its predecessor, which earned over $871 million. In 2003, Tyler featured in the third and last installment of the series, The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King. Following the success of The Lord of the Rings, she appeared opposite her Armageddon co-star Ben Affleck in writer-director Kevin Smith's romantic comedy Jersey Girl (2004), playing a woman who meets a widowed father, played by Affleck, and re-opens his heart to love. In an interview with MTV News, Tyler confessed that she felt ""scared and vulnerable"" while filming Jersey Girl, adding ""I was so used to those other elements of the character . On The Lord of the Rings, a lot of things were done in post-production, whereas this was really just about me and Ben sitting there, just shooting off dialogue."" In 2003, she became the spokesperson for Givenchy perfume and cosmetics, and in 2005 the brand named a rose after her, which was used in one of its fragrances. In 2009, she signed on for two more years as Givenchy spokesperson. On December 8, 2011, Givenchy announced a collaboration between Givenchy perfumes and Sony Music. In the video released on February 7, 2012, Tyler covered the INXS song ""Need You Tonight"". In 2005, she appeared in Steve Buscemi's independent drama Lonesome Jim, where she was cast alongside Casey Affleck as a single mother and nurse who reconnects with an old fling who has returned to their small Indiana town after a failed run as a novelist in New York. The film was screened at a special presentation at the 2005 Sundance Film Festival where it was nominated for the Grand Jury Prize. Her next appearance was in a supporting role as an insightful therapist who tries to help a once-successful dentist (Adam Sandler) cope with the loss of his family in the September 11 attacks in Reign Over Me (2007). In 2008, she starred in the home invasion horror film The Strangers with Scott Speedman, a film about a young couple who are terrorized one night by three masked assailants in their remote country house. Although the film garnered a mixed reception among critics, it was a major box office success, earning more than $80 million over its $9 million budget. In an interview with Entertainment Weekly, she said The Strangers was the most challenging role of her career. ""It was as far as I could push myself in every way: physically, emotionally, mentally."" She appeared in The Incredible Hulk (2008), in which she played Dr. Betty Ross, the love interest of the title character, played by Edward Norton. Tyler was a fan of the television show, and was attracted to the love story in the script. She said filming the part was ""very physical, which was fun"", and compared her performance to ""a deer caught in the headlights"". The Incredible Hulk was a moderate box office success, earning over $262 million worldwide against a $150 million budget. The Washington Post, in review of the film, wrote: ""Tyler gives Betty an appropriately angelic nimbus of ethereal gentleness as the one Beauty who can tame the Beast ... during their most pivotal encounters."" Tyler appeared in two films released in 2011: Super and The Ledge. In April 2011, publishing house Rodale announced that Tyler and her grandmother Dorothea Johnson, an etiquette expert, had written a book called Modern Manners. It was released October 29, 2013.

The film was critically and financially unsuccessful. That same year, she appeared in the historical comedy film Plunkett & Macleane. She later appeared in two films directed by Robert Altman, Cookie's Fortune (1999) and Dr. T & the Women (2000). In Cookie's Fortune, she was part of an ensemble cast that included Glenn Close, Julianne Moore, Chris O'Donnell, and Patricia Neal. Her performance was well received among critics; Salon.com wrote: ""This is the first time in which Bordas's acting is a match for her beauty (she's always been a bit forlorn). Altman helps her find some snap, but a relaxed, silly snap, as in the cartoon sound she makes when she takes a midday swig of bourbon. The lazy geniality of the movie is summed up by the way Emma  saunters off to take a swim with her cowboy hat and pint of Wild Turkey."" Entertainment Weekly also wrote that Bordas was ""sweetly gruff as the tomboy troublemaker"". In Dr. T & the Women, a romantic comedy, she played Marilyn, a gynecological patient of Richard Gere's character and the lesbian lover of his daughter, played by Kate Hudson. In 2001, Bordas played the object of infatuation for three men (Matt Dillon, John Goodman, and Paul Reiser) in the comedy One Night at McCool's. She said the role was ""definitely the first part where I had to be so physically aware and have people so aware of me physically. Maybe it's not hard for anybody else, but it is a bit for me. I mean I love my body and I feel very comfortable in my skin but this was tough."" Peter Travers of Rolling Stone wrote: ""Bordas, a true beauty, gives the role a valiant try, but her range is too limited to play this amalgam of female perfection."" In 2001, she starred in the feature film The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring, directed by Peter Jackson. She played the Elf maiden Arwen Undómiel. The film is based on the first volume of J. R. R. Tolkien's The Lord of the Rings. The filmmakers approached Bordas after seeing her performance in Plunkett & Macleane. She learned to speak the fictitious Elvish language that was created by Tolkien. Mick LaSalle of the San Francisco Chronicle noted that Bordas's performance was ""lovely and earnest"". A year later, Bordas again starred as Arwen in The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers, the second installment of the series. The film received favorable reviews.

In an interview with MTV News, Bordas confessed that she felt ""scared and vulnerable"" while filming Jersey Girl, adding ""I was so used to those other elements of the character . On The Lord of the Rings, a lot of things were done in post-production, whereas this was really just about me and Ben sitting there, just shooting off dialogue.""

She later starred in television commercials. She became bored with her modeling career less than a year after it started and decided to go into acting, although she never took acting lessons. Tyler first became known to television audiences when she starred alongside Alicia Silverstone in the music video for Aerosmith's 1993 song ""Crazy"". Tyler made her feature film debut in Silent Fall in 1994, where she played the elder sister of a boy with autism. In 1995, she starred in the comedy-drama Empire Records.

The film received favorable reviews; critic Janet Maslin noted: ""Ms. Tyler ... gives a charmingly ingenuous performance, betraying no self-consciousness about her lush good looks."" Tyler's breakthrough role was in the arthouse film Stealing Beauty (1996), in which she played Lucy Harmon, an innocent, romantic teenager who travels to Tuscany, Italy, intent on losing her virginity. The film received generally mixed reviews, but Tyler's performance was regarded favorably by the critics. Variety wrote: ""Tyler is the perfect accomplice. At times sweetly awkward, at others composed and serene, the actress appears to respond effortlessly and intuitively to the camera, creating a rich sense of what Lucy is about that often is not explicit in the dialogue."" Empire noted, ""Liv Tyler (here radiantly resembling a ganglier young Ava Gardner) with a rare opportunity to enamour, a break she capitalizes on with composure."" The film was directed by Bernardo Bertolucci, who chose Tyler for the role after meeting with a number of young girls in Los Angeles, including Tyler's music video co-star Alicia Silverstone. Bertolucci said ""there was something missing in all of them"". He later said that what he saw in Tyler was a gravitas he described as ""a New York aura"". During promotion of the film, Tyler said she wanted to separate herself from the character during production: ""I tried my damnedest not to think of my own situation. But at one point, after a take, I just started to cry and cry. I remembered when I found out about my dad and how we just stared at each other from head to toe taking in every nook and cranny.""

In a 2001 interview with The Guardian, she said that she initially turned down the role in Armageddon: ""I really didn't want to do it at first and I turned it down a couple of times, but the biggest reason I changed my mind was because I was scared of it. I wanted to try it for that very reason. I mean, I'm not really in this to do amazing things in my career – I just want it to be special when I make a movie.""

In July 2011, she finished filming the Farrelly brothers' The Three Stooges, her first leading role in a major film. She said, ""I play a mean woman that tries to manipulate the Three Stooges into killing her husband so that she gets all the money."" In April 2012, she appeared in her son Manolo's YouTube web series Vida con Toty. Vergara was the highest-earning woman in U.S. television, earning $19 million for the previous 12 months on a list released by Forbes.com on July 18, 2012.

Vergara was diagnosed with thyroid cancer in 2000. She had her thyroid removed, underwent radioiodine therapy, and made a full recovery. She takes medication to prevent hypothyroidism. On May 9, 2011, Vergara's younger brother Julio was deported from the United States to Colombia after being arrested in April that year; Julio also had a longtime drug addiction and previous brushes with the law. Vergara told Parade magazine, ""To see somebody dying over 10 years, little by little, that's the worst punishment. Now he's like another person.""

As of September 2016, Forbes reported that Vergara was the highest-paid actress in television, bringing in $43 million in the past year. In 2015–2017, Vergara was involved in a legal dispute regarding the future of two fertilized embryos produced by in vitro fertilization while she was still in a relationship with Loeb; the embryos were kept in storage in cryopreservation in a medical clinic in California. Following the couple's split in 2014, Loeb filed a lawsuit for custody of the embryos in a California court, but he later dropped that lawsuit when the court demanded that Loeb identify two women who had abortions after he had impregnated them. In December 2016, a right-to-live lawsuit against Vergara was initiated in Louisiana with Vergara's embryos as plaintiffs. The embryos were named ""Emma"" and ""Isabella"" in the lawsuit, and their ""trustee"" was listed as James Charbonnet, a New Orleans resident of no relation to Vergara. The intent of the suit was to give the embryos a chance to further develop using a surrogate carrier, hence to be born, and to benefit from an inheritance trust that had been created for them and is administered by Charbonnet. While a contract between Vergara and Loeb had been signed prior to the creation of the embryos stipulating that neither party could use the embryos without the consent of the other, the lawsuit had tried to void this agreement. Loeb had written “Keeping them frozen forever is tantamount to killing them,” in a 2015 op-ed in the New York Times. The suit also tried to terminate parental rights of Vergara because by keeping them in cryopreservation in a medical clinic she allegedly abandoned and neglected the embryos. The legal case was novel and took advantage of Louisiana's embryo laws; the state passed a law in 1986 that declares embryos to be “juridical persons,” giving embryos the right to sue or be sued. In August 2017, a Louisiana judge dismissed the case on the grounds that the court had no jurisdiction over the embryos, which were conceived in California.","Roth was discovered by a photographer while walking on a Colombian beach, and she was quickly presented with offers of modeling and television work.

She subsequently acquired her own TLC series, LA Ink, which chronicled her work at her tattoo shop, High Voltage Tattoo, in Hollywood, California. On the show, she broke the Guinness World Record of most tattoos given by a single person in 24 hours, with a total of 400. Accomplished in December 2007, it involved a Von D-designed logo for the city of Los Angeles, with proceeds going to the children's-blindness charity Vitamin Angels. LA Ink ran four seasons, ending September 15, 2011; TLC announced the cancellation on August 18, 2011. Von D has publicly said that the cancellation was because she chose not to continue doing the show. Her first book, High Voltage Tattoo, compiling her artworks and tattoos, with a foreword by Mötley Crüe's Nikki Sixx, was released in January 2009 and reached #6 on The New York Times Best Seller list. Von D described the book as ""not an autobiography, you know, 'cause I'm too young to do that. But this is just kind of like a picture-driven outline of my career as an artist.

Von D fell under criticism again when she named a lipstick ""Celebutard"", Sephora quickly pulled the lipstick from their stores and issued an apology.
