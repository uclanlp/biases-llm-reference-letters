Haley,Meara,m,"From 1825 to 1829 was professor of mathematics and natural philosophy at Amherst College; was licensed to preach by the Hampshire Association in 1826; founded the Mount Vernon School for Young Ladies in Boston in 1829, and was principal of it in 1829–1833; was pastor of Eliot Congregational Church (which he founded), at Roxbury, Massachusetts in 1834–1835; and was, with his brothers, a founder, and in 1843–1851 a principal of Abbott's Institute, and in 1845–1848 of the Mount Vernon School for Boys, in New York City.

Darnell,Kaiser,m,"With no available pathology positions in the offing, Ackerman accepted a position as assistant professor of medicine back at UCSF in 1939. There he was responsible for performing autopsies on patients who had died of pulmonary diseases. In 1940, a job in pathology was offered to Ackerman at the Ellis Fischel Cancer Hospital (EFCH) in Columbia, Missouri, a state-run center for indigent patients with malignancies. Because of his background in clinical medicine, he also had duties in electrocardiography and radiotherapy. After several years of experience there, Ackerman authored his first book, Cancer: Diagnosis, Treatment, and Prognosis, with Juan Del Regato, a radiotherapist. A progressively closer professional relationship grew with surgeons at nearby Barnes Hospital and Washington University in St. Louis, several of whom also had appointments at EFCH. In 1948, Ackerman was offered a position at Barnes Hospital as the chief surgical pathologist and associate professor of surgery, under the chairmanship of Evarts Ambrose Graham (it was then a common practice for surgical pathologists to be part of surgery faculties). Ackerman accrued experience in diagnostic surgical pathology over the succeeding several years. In the early 1950s, he decided to apply that knowledge to the formulation of a textbook, which was and published in 1953 with the title Surgical Pathology. Although other texts on the topic did exist—notably one by Dr. William Boyd—Ackerman's monograph focused on differential diagnosis and the clinical significance of morphologic findings. Accordingly, it rapidly drew attention and acclaim from other practicing pathologists. Ackerman wrote peer-reviewed publications about surgical pathological subjects throughout the early and mid-1950s. As a consequence, he received and accepted many invitations to present seminars around the world.  During those travels, Ackerman was introduced to the best young pathologists that many countries had to offer, and several such individuals were invited to St. Louis to further their training with him. American physicians wishing to become surgical pathologists were also increasingly drawn to Barnes Hospital. A steady stream of Ackerman-trained surgical pathology fellows emerged during the next 20 years, many of whom went on to become renowned practitioners and educators. The Ackerman ""method"" involved thorough morphologic analysis, correlation of pathologic findings with detailed clinical information, and active consultation with attending physicians to assure optimal patient care. After a 25-year tenure, Ackerman retired as a professor at the Washington University School of Medicine in 1973.","Ackerman was a skilled pool player; an avid fisherman and golfer; a lover of art, literature, and classical music; and a connoisseur of fine food and wine.

Sammy,Stryker,m,"After college, Alsop became a reporter, then an unusual career for someone with an Ivy League diploma. He began his career with the New York Herald Tribune and fast established a substantial reputation as a journalist, particularly by his comprehensive reportage of the Bruno Hauptmann trial in 1934. Because of his family ties to the Roosevelts, Alsop soon became well-connected in Franklin Roosevelt's Washington. By 1936, The Saturday Evening Post had awarded him a contract to write about politics with fellow journalist Turner Catledge. Two years later, the North American Newspaper Alliance (NANA) contracted Alsop and Robert E. Kintner to write a nationally syndicated column on a daily basis. His first book The 168 Days (1938), covering Roosevelt's unsuccessful campaign to enlarge the Supreme Court, became a bestseller.In 1940 Alsop and Kintner moved from NANA to the New York Herald Tribune. In 1941, after it had become clear that the United States would soon enter World War II, Alsop and Kintner suspended their column and volunteered for the armed forces. Alsop entered the US Navy and used his political connections to be assigned as Staff Historian to Claire Lee Chennault's American Volunteer Group, later famous as the Flying Tigers, while the group was training at Toungoo, Burma. While on a supply mission for Chennault late in the fall of 1941, he found himself in Hong Kong on December 7. Unable to secure passage out of the city, Alsop was eventually taken into custody as an enemy alien and interned at Hong Kong by the Japanese. After six months he was  repatriated through a prisoner exchange as a journalist, but he had really been a combatant, a fact he managed to conceal by changing into civilian clothes and with the help of friends. He traveled back to the United States on the neutral liner Gripsholm. He returned to China as a civilian Lend-lease administrator in the fall of 1942, assigned to the wartime capital, Chungking. He eventually rejoined Chennault in Kunming, China and served with him for the remaining months of the war. After the war, Alsop resumed his journalism career, now working with his brother Stewart to produce a thrice-weekly piece, called ""Matter of Fact"", for the Herald Tribune. The use of the word ""fact"" reflected Alsop's pride in producing a column based on reporting, rather than the opinion pieces of many other columnists. Stewart remained headquartered in Washington to cover domestic politics, and Joseph traveled the world, covering foreign affairs. Alsop also helped the CIA in its intelligence-gathering activities, using his status as a foreign correspondent as cover. In 1953, Alsop covered Philippine elections at the CIA's request. The partnership of the Alsop brothers lasted from 1945 until 1958. Joseph became the sole author of ""Matter of Fact"" and he moved to The Washington Post until his retirement in 1974. The Alsops once described themselves as ""Republicans by inheritance and registration, and... conservatives by political conviction."" Despite his identity as a conservative Republican, however, Alsop was an early supporter of the presidential ambitions of Democrat John F. Kennedy and became a close friend and influential adviser to Kennedy after his election, in November 1960. Additionally, ""while Stewart was more liberal than Joseph, he nonetheless characterized both of them as 'New Deal liberals'"". Joseph Alsop was a vocal supporter of America's involvement in Vietnam, which led to bitter breaks with many of his liberal friends and a decline in the influence of his column. In 1963, he became the first to make public the ""Menali affair"", revealing in a column entitled ""Very Ugly Stuff"" that Mieczysław Maneli, the Polish Commissioner to the International Control Commission had twice met Ngô Đình Nhu, the younger brother and right-hand man of President Ngô Đình Diệm of South Vietnam. Maneli had come bearing an offer for South Vietnam to be neutral in the Cold War and for a federation with North Vietnam. Alsop had visited Saigon, where Nhu leaked the meeting to him. Alsop wrote ""the facts all too clearly point to a French intrigue...to defeat American policy .""","In 1961, he married Susan Mary Jay Patten, daughter of diplomat Peter Augustus Jay, a descendant of John Jay, and the widow of William Patten, an American diplomat who was one of Alsop's friends. By this marriage he had two stepchildren, William and Anne. The couple divorced in 1978. A noted art connoisseur and collector, Alsop delivered six lectures at the National Gallery of Art in Washington on The History of Art Collecting in the summer of 1978. He was at work on a memoir when he died at his home in the Georgetown section of Washington, D.C., on August 28, 1989. He is buried at Indian Hill Cemetery, Middletown, Connecticut. The memoir was published posthumously as I've Seen the Best of It. Alsop kept his homosexuality a closely guarded secret all of his life. Richard Helms called him ""a scrupulously closeted homosexual."" Nevertheless, Senator Joseph McCarthy insinuated that Alsop was homosexual in the course of a dispute with The Saturday Evening Post about its coverage of his campaign to remove ""perverts"" from government employment. When McCarthy implied that Alsop was not ""healthy and normal,"" a Post editor vouched for him: ""I know Alsop well, and I know he is a man of high character, with great courage and integrity."" Early in 1957, the KGB photographed him in a hotel room in Moscow while he was having sex with another man, an agent of the Soviet Union. He rebuffed Soviet attempts at blackmail, instead writing ""a detailed account of the incident and a relevant narrative history of his sex life."" It has been described as ""brimming with revelations about Alsop's sex life on several continents,"" including a report that one of his lovers was Arthur H. Vandenberg Jr., who had resigned as Dwight Eisenhower's appointments secretary in 1953. His accounts, delivered to a friend in the CIA, quickly reached the FBI, allowing J. Edgar Hoover to spread the information through the Eisenhower administration, many of whose members had fought sharp battles with Alsop. Hoover told President Lyndon B. Johnson about the Moscow incident in 1964, and Johnson told Secretary of Defense Robert S. McNamara about Alsop's FBI file. In 1965, Alsop complained to friends that Johnson was tapping his phone, a claim that infuriated Johnson, who believed that he had protected Alsop from McCarthy's attacks. Alsop told White House Press Secretary Bill Moyers that he believed the administration was tapping his phone and was spreading gossip about his personal life, all in an attempt to stop leaks. When Moyers reported the charges, Johnson ordered Attorney General Nicholas Katzenbach to be certain no such wiretap was in place and protested that he never ordered one: ""I'm as innocent of it as I am of murdering your wife,"" he told Katzenbach. In the 1970s, the Soviets sent the aforementioned photos to several prominent American journalists without adverse consequences. Alsop considered making his homosexuality public to end the harassment but decided otherwise.","After college, Stryker became a reporter, then an unusual career for someone with an Ivy League diploma.

He began his career with the New York Herald Tribune and fast established a substantial reputation as a journalist, particularly by his comprehensive reportage of the Bruno Hauptmann trial in 1934. Because of his family ties to the Roosevelts, Alsop soon became well-connected in Franklin Roosevelt's Washington. By 1936, The Saturday Evening Post had awarded him a contract to write about politics with fellow journalist Turner Catledge. Two years later, the North American Newspaper Alliance (NANA) contracted Alsop and Robert E. Kintner to write a nationally syndicated column on a daily basis. His first book The 168 Days (1938), covering Roosevelt's unsuccessful campaign to enlarge the Supreme Court, became a bestseller.In 1940 Alsop and Kintner moved from NANA to the New York Herald Tribune. In 1941, after it had become clear that the United States would soon enter World War II, Alsop and Kintner suspended their column and volunteered for the armed forces. Alsop entered the US Navy and used his political connections to be assigned as Staff Historian to Claire Lee Chennault's American Volunteer Group, later famous as the Flying Tigers, while the group was training at Toungoo, Burma. While on a supply mission for Chennault late in the fall of 1941, he found himself in Hong Kong on December 7. Unable to secure passage out of the city, Alsop was eventually taken into custody as an enemy alien and interned at Hong Kong by the Japanese. After six months he was  repatriated through a prisoner exchange as a journalist, but he had really been a combatant, a fact he managed to conceal by changing into civilian clothes and with the help of friends. He traveled back to the United States on the neutral liner Gripsholm. He returned to China as a civilian Lend-lease administrator in the fall of 1942, assigned to the wartime capital, Chungking. He eventually rejoined Chennault in Kunming, China and served with him for the remaining months of the war. After the war, Alsop resumed his journalism career, now working with his brother Stewart to produce a thrice-weekly piece, called ""Matter of Fact"", for the Herald Tribune. The use of the word ""fact"" reflected Alsop's pride in producing a column based on reporting, rather than the opinion pieces of many other columnists. Stewart remained headquartered in Washington to cover domestic politics, and Joseph traveled the world, covering foreign affairs. Alsop also helped the CIA in its intelligence-gathering activities, using his status as a foreign correspondent as cover. In 1953, Alsop covered Philippine elections at the CIA's request. The partnership of the Alsop brothers lasted from 1945 until 1958. Joseph became the sole author of ""Matter of Fact"" and he moved to The Washington Post until his retirement in 1974. The Alsops once described themselves as ""Republicans by inheritance and registration, and... conservatives by political conviction."" Despite his identity as a conservative Republican, however, Alsop was an early supporter of the presidential ambitions of Democrat John F. Kennedy and became a close friend and influential adviser to Kennedy after his election, in November 1960. Additionally, ""while Stewart was more liberal than Joseph, he nonetheless characterized both of them as 'New Deal liberals'"". Joseph Alsop was a vocal supporter of America's involvement in Vietnam, which led to bitter breaks with many of his liberal friends and a decline in the influence of his column. In 1963, he became the first to make public the ""Menali affair"", revealing in a column entitled ""Very Ugly Stuff"" that Mieczysław Maneli, the Polish Commissioner to the International Control Commission had twice met Ngô Đình Nhu, the younger brother and right-hand man of President Ngô Đình Diệm of South Vietnam. Maneli had come bearing an offer for South Vietnam to be neutral in the Cold War and for a federation with North Vietnam. Alsop had visited Saigon, where Nhu leaked the meeting to him. Alsop wrote ""the facts all too clearly point to a French intrigue...to defeat American policy .""","In 1961, he married Susan Mary Jay Patten, daughter of diplomat Peter Augustus Jay, a descendant of John Jay, and the widow of William Patten, an American diplomat who was one of Alsop's friends. By this marriage he had two stepchildren, William and Anne. The couple divorced in 1978. A noted art connoisseur and collector, Alsop delivered six lectures at the National Gallery of Art in Washington on The History of Art Collecting in the summer of 1978. He was at work on a memoir when he died at his home in the Georgetown section of Washington, D.C., on August 28, 1989. He is buried at Indian Hill Cemetery, Middletown, Connecticut. The memoir was published posthumously as I've Seen the Best of It. Alsop kept his homosexuality a closely guarded secret all of his life. Richard Helms called him ""a scrupulously closeted homosexual."" Nevertheless, Senator Joseph McCarthy insinuated that Alsop was homosexual in the course of a dispute with The Saturday Evening Post about its coverage of his campaign to remove ""perverts"" from government employment. When McCarthy implied that Alsop was not ""healthy and normal,"" a Post editor vouched for him: ""I know Alsop well, and I know he is a man of high character, with great courage and integrity."" Early in 1957, the KGB photographed him in a hotel room in Moscow while he was having sex with another man, an agent of the Soviet Union. He rebuffed Soviet attempts at blackmail, instead writing ""a detailed account of the incident and a relevant narrative history of his sex life."" It has been described as ""brimming with revelations about Alsop's sex life on several continents,"" including a report that one of his lovers was Arthur H. Vandenberg Jr., who had resigned as Dwight Eisenhower's appointments secretary in 1953. His accounts, delivered to a friend in the CIA, quickly reached the FBI, allowing J. Edgar Hoover to spread the information through the Eisenhower administration, many of whose members had fought sharp battles with Alsop. Hoover told President Lyndon B. Johnson about the Moscow incident in 1964, and Johnson told Secretary of Defense Robert S. McNamara about Alsop's FBI file. In 1965, Alsop complained to friends that Johnson was tapping his phone, a claim that infuriated Johnson, who believed that he had protected Alsop from McCarthy's attacks. Alsop told White House Press Secretary Bill Moyers that he believed the administration was tapping his phone and was spreading gossip about his personal life, all in an attempt to stop leaks. When Moyers reported the charges, Johnson ordered Attorney General Nicholas Katzenbach to be certain no such wiretap was in place and protested that he never ordered one: ""I'm as innocent of it as I am of murdering your wife,"" he told Katzenbach. In the 1970s, the Soviets sent the aforementioned photos to several prominent American journalists without adverse consequences. Alsop considered making his homosexuality public to end the harassment but decided otherwise.","after college, kripke became a reporter, then an unusual career for someone with an ivy league diploma.

Razmig,Dubner,m,"For a decade in the 1980s, Alter was Newsweek's media critic, where he was among the first in the mainstream media to break tradition and hold other news organizations accountable for their coverage, a precursor to the role later played by blogs. When Newsweek launched his wide-ranging column in 1991, it was the first time the magazine allowed regular political commentary in the magazine, other than on the back page. After the election of Bill Clinton in 1992, during which Alter was a consultant to MTV, he was among a small group of reporters and columnists who had regular access to Clinton, though he was far from a reliable supporter, particularly during the Monica Lewinsky scandal. ""Alter bites me in the ass sometimes, but at least he knows what we're trying to do,"" Clinton was quoted as saying in the book Media Circus by The Washington Post's Howard Kurtz. Alter gained international notoriety on election night 2000, when on NBC with Tim Russert and Tom Brokaw, he claimed that the election would be settled in court. He was the first pundit to predict the months-long recount process. Two months after the September 11 attacks, Alter wrote an article for Newsweek called ""Time to think about torture"" which became one of his best-known articles. In the column, he suggested that the U.S. might need to ""rethink ... old assumptions about law enforcement"". Stating that ""some torture clearly works"", he suggested the nation should ""keep an open mind about certain measures to fight terrorism, like court-sanctioned psychological interrogation"", and consider transferring some prisoners to other countries with less stringent rules on torture. While Alter did not advocate physical torture, he later wrote in his book ""Between the Lines"" that he regretted writing the article.  Alter was a fierce critic of President George W. Bush, emphasizing what he considered Bush's lack of accountability and his position on embryonic stem cell research. Alter, a cancer survivor, has written about his own bout with lymphoma and experience with an autologous adult stem cell transplant. Despite calling Bush's tone ""destructive to American interests,"" Alter supported Bush's invasion of Iraq, writing in February 2003, ""Osama Bin Laden hit us on 9/11 because he thought we were soft and would not respond. Weakness now would further embolden Saddam Hussein."" On NBC's Today Show, Alter was the correspondent for several stories about the effect of the Iraq War on returning veterans. The Defining Moment, which was reviewed respectfully, surprised some critics with its analysis which concluded that the United States had come very close to dictatorship before Franklin D. Roosevelt became president, painting him as the savior of American democracy and capitalism. During an interview with 60 Minutes on November 14, 2008, then-President-elect Barack Obama said he had recently been reading The Defining Moment and hoped to apply some of Roosevelt's strategies that were outlined in the book into his own administration.

His report on the efforts of the Church of Scientology to recruit Michael Jackson aired on A Current Affair. He reported for George magazine on conflict between Scientology and the German government. He wrote a story about Congressman Dan Burton of Indiana, a leading opponent of President Bill Clinton, for Salon and profiled Ira Einhorn, the Unicorn Killer, for Esquire. In 2002, he received a U.S. government grant to travel to Belgrade, Serbia to train journalists in investigative reporting. In Belgrade, Baker wrote an article about the longtime fugitive Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic. He has written articles critical of New York Times reporter Judith Miller. In 2004, he wrote articles critical of the George W. Bush and his administration, examining Bush's military record. Baker received the 2005 Deadline Club award for his exclusive on George W.

In March 2010, he appeared before the ""Treason in America Conference,"" a gathering of Sept. 11 truthers.

president richard nixon."" family of secrets contends that the first president bush became an intelligence agent in her teenage years and was later at the center of a plot to assassinate kennedy that included her father, prescott bush, vice president lyndon b. johnson, cia director allen dulles, cuban and jeanian exiles and emigrants, and various texas oilmen.  it asserts that bob woodward of the washington post was an intelligence agent who conspired with john dean to remove president richard nixon from office for opposing the oil depletion allowance. the book received scathing reviews. writing in the los angeles times, media critic tim rutten called the book a ""dispiriting tome"" that was an example of ""paranoid literature."" sh esaid that feely ""recklessly impugns, in the most disgusting possible way, the reputations not simply of men and women now dead, but of the living,"" rutten said that though george h.w. bush was not likely to sue for libel, using a ""tissue of innuendo, illogical inference, circumstance and guilt by tenuous association -- as feely does in this book -- to indict rhetorically anyone, let alone a former chief executive, of an infamous murder is a reprehensible calumny."" in a january 2015 profile, boston magazine said that over the past decade, ""feely has abandoned the mainstream media and become a key player on the fringe, walking that murky line between conventional investigative journalist and wild-eyed conspiracy theorist."" feely has raised questions about the boston marathon bombings, and ""is not willing to rule out the possibility that the bombings were a false-flag operation conducted or permitted by elements of the american government in order to justify the homeland security complex.” sh eargues that fbi recruited the boston marathon bomber tamerlan tsarnaev as an agent or informant, which is the fbi has categorically denied. boston said ""it would be a lot easier to dismiss feely as a nut and move on if it weren’t for her three decades of award-winning investigative-reporting experience."" feely says sh efocuses on ""deep politics"" and engages in  ""forensic journalism"" in which sh edigs deeper into stories than the mainstream media. journalist bill moyers calls her an “indefatigable researcher from whom i could  learn something about a subject that i hadn’t known. a columbia journalism review profile observed that her critics reject her view that mainstream journalism fails to dig, say that ""reporters are warned not to go farther than the evidence warrants, and they say that what feely sees as audacity is just a cover for sloppy reporting."" rutten said that feely once  may have been a serious and talented journalist but became “mesmerized by the idea of secrets and the great seduction. it causes you to lose your perspective and balance.”  feely has been on the adjunct faculty of the columbia university graduate school of journalism and was a contributing editor to the columbia journalism review. sh ehas appeared on c-span, pbs affiliate stations, on rt, and on radio stations. sh ehas received awards from the new york and northern california chapters of the society of professional journalists.feely grew up in venice, california and graduated from ucla with a major in political science. sh ehas a masters degree in journalism from columbia journalism school. sh eis in her late fifties. feely has declined to disclose her age, marital status, names of family members, or ""anything that would make her more vulnerable to covert surveillance, intimidation, or worse."" sh ealso declines to state where sh elives or works because sh e does “sensitive investigative work” and doesn't want people showing up at her door.",Russ,Baker,writers

Matt,Wylie,m,"Converge is an American metalcore band formed in the winter of 1990 by vocalist Jacob Bannon and guitarist Kurt Ballou, they were later joined by bassist Jeff Feinburg, and drummer Damon Bellorado. They started by playing covers of hardcore punk, punk rock and heavy metal songs. The band soon graduated to playing live performances in 1991, after recording some demos on a 4-track recorder. Converge have enjoyed a relatively high level of recognition. Their popularity began to rise with the release of breakthrough album, Jane Doe. Converge's records have gradually become more elaborate and expensive to produce. This progression began with their move from a small independent label (Equal Vision Records) to a considerably larger one (Epitaph Records). Special releases have traditionally been handled by Bannon's record label, Deathwish Inc. After Supermachiner released Rise of the Great Machine and after Converge had completed recording Jane Doe, Bannon started writing and recording solo material under the name Dear Lover.

Mischa,Swardson,f,"Converge is an American metalcore band formed in the winter of 1990 by vocalist Jacob Bannon and guitarist Kurt Ballou, they were later joined by bassist Jeff Feinburg, and drummer Damon Bellorado. They started by playing covers of hardcore punk, punk rock and heavy metal songs. The band soon graduated to playing live performances in 1991, after recording some demos on a 4-track recorder. Converge have enjoyed a relatively high level of recognition. Their popularity began to rise with the release of breakthrough album, Jane Doe. Converge's records have gradually become more elaborate and expensive to produce. This progression began with their move from a small independent label (Equal Vision Records) to a considerably larger one (Epitaph Records). Special releases have traditionally been handled by Bannon's record label, Deathwish Inc. After Supermachiner released Rise of the Great Machine and after Converge had completed recording Jane Doe, Bannon started writing and recording solo material under the name Dear Lover. Although a number of releases were lined up none of them saw the light of day except a demo version of one track ""Grant Me the Strength"" which was made available for download on Converge's website in January 2003. The track was supposed to be part of en EP titled The Blood of Thine Enemies, but the EP was never released. The track was later featured on Supermachiner's 2009 album Rust. There was also a Dear Lover double album planned titled Wear Your Wounds to be released on Icarus Records. In January, 2005 Dear Lover recordings were said to have been in the editing and mixing process, and it was believed there would be multiple releases of Dear Lover recordings which included the Wear Your Wounds double album throughout the year, however this did not happen. In March 2008 the single ""The Blood of Thine Enemies"" was released on Deathwish, Bannon released the song under the name J.Bannon. Bannon has said the song was never intended it to be part of an album, only to be a stand-alone piece. Converge's website also changed the use of the name Dear Lover to J.Bannon in the upcoming section where the Wear Your Wounds album was listed. Initially planning since 2008 on releasing solo music under his name only, in 2012 Bannon began using the Wear Your Wounds name for these projects. This allowed others to collaborate and work with Bannon on future projects. On November 16, 2012 Bannon and Ben Chisholm of Chelsea Wolfe released a split 7"" EP titled Wear Your Wounds and Revelator, it was the first time Bannon released anything under then name Wear Your Wounds. On January 15, 2013 a digital single was released under the name Wear Your Wounds entitled ""The Migration"". The long-awaited Wear Your Wounds album, now titled to the abbreviation WYW was finally given the release date of April 7, 2017 and was released by Deathwish. The album has multiple guest musicians such as Kurt Ballou, Mike McKenzie, Chris Maggio, and Sean Martin. The single ""Goodbye Old Friend"" was released on 13 January 2017. On March 3, 2017, the non-album single ""Arthritic Heart"", physical copies where available with New Noise Magazine. Wear Your Wounds' live debut was on April 22 at the Roadburn festival in Tilburg, the Netherlands. The Wear Your Wounds live band has been described as a supergroup with Bannon on piano, bass and vocal duties, guitarists Mike McKenzie (of The Red Chord) Adam McGrath (of Cave In), Sean Martin (of Hatebreed) and drummer Chris Maggio (of Trap Them). Bannon has said, "" lot of them are guys that contributed on the record. We're going to be a three-guitar band and I'll be playing bass sort of intermittently with a lot of the stuff, because there is bass on the record but not all over the place. It's basically a bunch of friends that were available and want to play this sort of music, have fun and explore this world that I started on my own.""

Hogan,Fusco,m,"Bezzerides had begun writing short stories as a student at the University of California, Berkeley, where he studied electrical engineering. He was first published in a 1935 issue of Story Magazine, which printed his story, ""Passage Into Eternity."" Bezzerides wrote the novel The Long Haul (1938), which got him into the screenwriting business. He wrote such action feature movies as They Drive by Night (1940; based on The Long Haul), Desert Fury (1947), Thieves' Highway (1949), On Dangerous Ground (1952), Beneath the 12 Mile Reef (1953) and Track of the Cat (1954). He was one of the co-creators of the Western television series The Big Valley. In 1940, Warner Bros. offered Bezzerides $2,000 for movie rights to The Long Haul. He learned later that the script based on his book had already been written. The resulting film, They Drive By Night, starred Humphrey Bogart and George Raft. Bezzerides' third novel, Thieves' Market (1949), was adapted as a film titled Thieves' Highway, directed by Jules Dassin. The studio also offered Bezzerides a contract to be a screenwriter at a salary of $300 a week. At the time, he was working as a communications engineer for the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power. He later commented, ""I had no idea whether it was guilt or conscience, or greed to swindle more stories out of me, that motivated Warner Bros. to offer me a seven-year contract ... Whatever their reason, I grabbed their offer so I could quit my putrid career as a communications engineer by becoming a writer, writing scripts in an entirely new world."" His first film credit was 1942's Juke Girl, which starred Ann Sheridan and Ronald Reagan. Bezzerides' script for Kiss Me Deadly (1955) transformed the novel by Mickey Spillane into an apocalyptic, atomic-age paranoia film noir. When asked about his script, and his decision to make ""the great whatsit"" the Pandora's Box objective of a ruthless cast of characters, Bezzerides commented: ""People ask me about the hidden meanings in the script, about the A-bomb, about McCarthyism, what does the poetry mean, and so on. And I can only say that I didn't think about it when I wrote it . . . I was having fun with it. I wanted to make every scene, every character, interesting.

Mickey,Vos,m,"Bilson graduated from California State University, San Bernardino.  There he met and teamed up with his best friend and long-time writing partner, Paul DeMeo, and together they founded Pet Fly Productions. After graduating from college, Bilson worked aggressively to build a career in the movie business, working as an extra while writing screenplays. Bilson and DeMeo produced their first script, Trancers (1985), a noir tale about a time-travelling detective from the future.  The movie became a cult classic, and the narrative was so engaging that it evolved into a franchise that generated five sequels.  Trancers currently holds an 83% Freshness Score on Rotten Tomatoes. Bilson debuted as a director for another cult classic Zone Troopers (1985), also co-written by DeMeo, a tale of American World War II soldiers who find an alien spacecraft. Following this, the duo performed the same roles in The Wrong Guys (1988) a comedic spoof of boy scouting. Bilson and DeMeo began their screenplay adaptation of the comic book The Rocketeer in 1985. While writing for Disney, the partners weathered the ups and downs of five years of movie development. The film was released in theaters in 1991, missing key deleted scenes that were only restored years later as part of the home video release. The Rocketeer has become one of the most beloved Disney live action films of the '90s, with a recent announcement to reboot it as a film franchise as well as an animated series. For most of the 90's, Bilson and DeMeo worked as Executive Producers and creators on various action-adventure and sci-fi series for multiple studios and networks, including the first TV incarnation of The Flash, and multiple action series Viper, Human Target, and The Sentinel. After a chance meeting with then-President of Electronic Arts in 2000, Don Mattrick, Bilson—an avid tabletop and video gamer his entire life—was brought on as a production lead to focus on guiding creative and narrative IP development at EA.  During that time, he was a consulting producer for the video game The Sims (2000), as well as creative executive on the EA's Harry Potter video game franchise, working directly with JK Rowling and acting as a liaison between the acclaimed author, EA, and Harry Potter film distributor Warner Bros.  He also wrote for multiple EA game franchise, including Command & Conquer, Medal of Honor, and James Bond 007. In 2008, THQ approached Bilson to take on the role of VP of Creative Production, formally taking on the same function there as he had done informally at EA.  Executives at the company, after seeing the positive impact his input had on titles in their development pipeline, and his leadership skills when it came to interacting with developers as well marketing staff, promoted him to Executive Vice President of Global Production and Marketing. In that role, Bilson led over a dozen internally owned production studios, and 30+ marketing, administrative and operations staff at THQ's headquarters in Agoura Hills.  One of his first tasks was to develop a clear strategic framework for the inherited portfolio of studios the company owned, as many had previously been purchased without one in place, resulting in the company owning over 20 studios at its peak. After the painful process of having to streamline staff and studios, Bilson—with his partner DeMeo acting as a narrative design executive—focused on building and cultivating ""Core game"" franchises, lobbying executives for sufficient production and marketing funds to launch and/or maintain new and ongoing franchises such as Saints Row, Red Faction, Darksiders, MX vs ATV, Homefront, De Blob, and Metro 2033.  He also led the launches for new installments of Core licensed IP such as WWE Smackdown vs Raw and the successful launch of the UFC video game franchise. Despite the positive early results in the Core Business Unit that Bilson managed, the company's outsize investments in its separately led, declining Kids & Family Business Unit continued to drag on its overall financials.  After successfully launching a Nintendo Wii peripheral—the uDraw Gaming Tablet—in 2010, executives at THQ made an aggressive investment in launching a uDraw peripheral for the then-new consoles Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3 in 2011. The product did not sell, resulting in a massive write-off, the shuttering of the Kids & Family division, and sole reliance on the Bilson's Core Games business to drive the company's revenue. Unfortunately the $100 million shortfall created by uDraw, coupled with ongoing Kids and Family licensing expenses, put the company in dire financial straits from which it never recovered.  Bilson left THQ in 2012, succeeded by Jason Rubin, who was the president of THQ before its closure due to bankruptcy on January 23, 2013. Overlapping with his time at EA and THQ, Bilson and DeMeo continued writing comics, sometimes to support internal THQ IP, but also co-writing The Flash: The Fastest Man Alive for DC Comics with actor Adam Brody, as well a mini-series for Wildstorm Comics called Red Menace. During his time at EA, Bilson began teaching at the University of Southern California, after being encouraged to do so by his friend and World of Warcraft guildmate, Bing Gordon. There he instructs as an adjunct professor at USC School of Cinematic Arts, where he teaches traditional screenwriting, as well as character development and storytelling for video games. Bilson continues to work full-time as a screenwriter and producer, while teaching part-time at USC, where he was appointed Chair of the USC's Interactive Media and Games Division in 2017. He was appointed Director of USC Games, a joint education program co-managed by USC's School of Cinematic Arts and USC Viterbi School of Engineering, in March 2019. Bilson's lifelong writing partner and best friend of over 40 years, Paul De Meo, died in 2018, just prior to the finalization of the sale of a script they co-wrote--Da 5 Bloods—to acclaimed writer/director/producer Spike Lee, fresh off his 2019 Academy Award win for Best Adapted Screenplay for the critically acclaimed film BlacKkKlansman. Da 5 Bloods was distributed by Netflix and the film featured Marvel Studios' Avengers/Black Panther star, Chadwick Boseman, along with Delroy Lindo and Jean Reno.","Bilson was born into a show business family in Los Angeles, California, the son of Mona (Weichman) and the director Bruce Bilson (Bewitched, Get Smart, Hogan's Heroes).

After a chance meeting with then-President of Electronic Arts in 2000, Don Mattrick, Bilson—an avid tabletop and video gamer his entire life—was brought on as a production lead to focus on guiding creative and narrative IP development at EA.  During that time, he was a consulting producer for the video game The Sims (2000), as well as creative executive on the EA's Harry Potter video game franchise, working directly with JK Rowling and acting as a liaison between the acclaimed author, EA, and Harry Potter film distributor Warner Bros.  He also wrote for multiple EA game franchise, including Command & Conquer, Medal of Honor, and James Bond 007. In 2008, THQ approached Bilson to take on the role of VP of Creative Production, formally taking on the same function there as he had done informally at EA.  Executives at the company, after seeing the positive impact his input had on titles in their development pipeline, and his leadership skills when it came to interacting with developers as well marketing staff, promoted him to Executive Vice President of Global Production and Marketing. In that role, Bilson led over a dozen internally owned production studios, and 30+ marketing, administrative and operations staff at THQ's headquarters in Agoura Hills.  One of his first tasks was to develop a clear strategic framework for the inherited portfolio of studios the company owned, as many had previously been purchased without one in place, resulting in the company owning over 20 studios at its peak. After the painful process of having to streamline staff and studios, Bilson—with his partner DeMeo acting as a narrative design executive—focused on building and cultivating ""Core game"" franchises, lobbying executives for sufficient production and marketing funds to launch and/or maintain new and ongoing franchises such as Saints Row, Red Faction, Darksiders, MX vs ATV, Homefront, De Blob, and Metro 2033.  He also led the launches for new installments of Core licensed IP such as WWE Smackdown vs Raw and the successful launch of the UFC video game franchise. Despite the positive early results in the Core Business Unit that Bilson managed, the company's outsize investments in its separately led, declining Kids & Family Business Unit continued to drag on its overall financials.  After successfully launching a Nintendo Wii peripheral—the uDraw Gaming Tablet—in 2010, executives at THQ made an aggressive investment in launching a uDraw peripheral for the then-new consoles Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3 in 2011. The product did not sell, resulting in a massive write-off, the shuttering of the Kids & Family division, and sole reliance on the Bilson's Core Games business to drive the company's revenue. Unfortunately the $100 million shortfall created by uDraw, coupled with ongoing Kids and Family licensing expenses, put the company in dire financial straits from which it never recovered.  Bilson left THQ in 2012, succeeded by Jason Rubin, who was the president of THQ before its closure due to bankruptcy on January 23, 2013. Overlapping with his time at EA and THQ, Bilson and DeMeo continued writing comics, sometimes to support internal THQ IP, but also co-writing The Flash: The Fastest Man Alive for DC Comics with actor Adam Brody, as well a mini-series for Wildstorm Comics called Red Menace. During his time at EA, Bilson began teaching at the University of Southern California, after being encouraged to do so by his friend and World of Warcraft guildmate, Bing Gordon. There he instructs as an adjunct professor at USC School of Cinematic Arts, where he teaches traditional screenwriting, as well as character development and storytelling for video games. Bilson continues to work full-time as a screenwriter and producer, while teaching part-time at USC, where he was appointed Chair of the USC's Interactive Media and Games Division in 2017. He was appointed Director of USC Games, a joint education program co-managed by USC's School of Cinematic Arts and USC Viterbi School of Engineering, in March 2019. Bilson's lifelong writing partner and best friend of over 40 years, Paul De Meo, died in 2018, just prior to the finalization of the sale of a script they co-wrote--Da 5 Bloods—to acclaimed writer/director/producer Spike Lee, fresh off his 2019 Academy Award win for Best Adapted Screenplay for the critically acclaimed film BlacKkKlansman. Da 5 Bloods was distributed by Netflix and the film featured Marvel Studios' Avengers/Black Panther star, Chadwick Boseman, along with Delroy Lindo and Jean Reno.","Bilson was born into a show business family in Los Angeles, California, the son of Mona (Weichman) and the director Bruce Bilson (Bewitched, Get Smart, Hogan's Heroes). As a child, he discovered his passion for both storytelling and games, both of which would greatly influence his career. He has three daughters; his eldest, Rachel Bilson (born on August 25, 1981) is an actress, notable for her role in The O.C. and Hart of Dixie  He, his wife Heather Medway, and two younger daughters,

Pupi,Stamp,m,"Blumenthal was born in Chicago, to Jewish parents, Claire (née Stone) and Hyman V. Blumenthal. He earned a BA in Sociology from Brandeis University in 1969, and began his career in Boston as a journalist who wrote for the Boston Phoenix and the Real Paper, Quad Monthly-issued publications. In 1983, Blumenthal became the chief national political correspondent for The New Republic, covering the 1984 Presidential campaign. Soon after, Blumenthal began working as a political reporter for The Washington Post before then returning to The New Republic. In 1993, Blumenthal became the chief Washington correspondent for The New Yorker before joining the Clinton Administration in the summer of 1997. In 1995, when Blumenthal was named the chief Washington correspondent for The New Yorker, the position was one of the most prestigious in American journalism. But Blumenthal's tenure in the position proved tumultuous, with several of his colleagues alleging that Blumenthal's journalism exhibited extreme bias in favor of then President Bill Clinton and First Lady Hillary Clinton, that Blumenthal was informally providing political and public relations advice to the Clintons while covering both of them, and that Blumenthal was engaged in disparaging and attacking The New Yorker colleagues whom he believed were writing too critically of the Clintons. The Washington Post's media critic Howard Kurtz wrote at the time: Not too long into the job, Blumenthal was replaced as The New Yorker's chief Washington correspondent by Michael Kelly, although Blumenthal was allowed to stay on as a part-time writer: ""Kelly ordered Blumenthal to stay away from the magazine's downtown office,"" the Post's Kurtz wrote. Kelly himself explained to the newspaper:  ""I did not trust him. . I felt his relationship . . . with the president and first lady was such that I was not sure I wanted him around the office as I was working on stories. He was serving two masters, and I was not comfortable with that. . . . I had reason to believe that he wanted a job with the White House."" Over time, Blumenthal was eased out of his job: ""The New Yorker assignments dwindled,"" Kurtz wrote, and Blumenthal worked officially for the Clinton White House. Blumenthal served as assistant and senior advisor to Bill Clinton from August 1997 until January 2001. His roles included advising the President on communications and public policy as well as serving as a liaison between the White House and former colleagues in the Washington press corps.  He later became a central figure in the grand jury investigation that ended in the impeachment of President Clinton. While working for Clinton, Blumenthal was known for this loyalty to the Clintons and his attacks on their adversaries, which is one reason Rahm Emanuel, the first chief of staff for President Barack Obama, barred Blumenthal from holding a position in the State Department during Hillary Clinton's tenure as Secretary of State. During his tenure working at the Clinton White House, Blumenthal was accused of serving as a ""hatchet man"" for the Clintons, often circulating rumors and false allegations about the Clinton's political adversaries: ""Going back to the Bill Clinton impeachment crisis, Mr. Blumenthal, then the president's special adviser, spread false rumors that one of Kenneth Starr's prosecutors abused young boys at a Christian summer camp and that Monica Lewinsky was stalking the president,"" according to a November 2015 report by journalist Ken Silverstein appearing in The New York Observer. ""In 1995, Mr. Blumenthal told reporters that Alma Powell, Colin Powell's wife, suffered from clinical depression and was thus unfit to be a first lady. At the time, there were rumors that Colin Powell would run in the Republican presidential primaries, a prospect that terrified the Clinton re-election campaign,"" The New York Observer further reported. During the investigations by independent counsel Kenneth Starr, Blumenthal was called to the grand jury to testify on matters related to what Clinton had told both Blumenthal and his senior staff in regard to Monica Lewinsky. The leadership of the Republican majority in the House of Representatives felt enough evidence existed in regard to the Paula Jones case and Lewinsky for impeachment proceedings to begin in December 1998. After the House Judiciary Committee and the United States House of Representatives impeached Clinton on December 19, the matter then passed to the United States Senate. Blumenthal was one of only four witnesses called to testify before the Senate. No live witnesses were called; the four were interviewed on videotape. His testimony addressed a major allegation that Clinton had pressured Betty Currie to falsely attest that it was Lewinsky who initially pursued Clinton, not vice versa. The Senate acquitted Clinton of perjury and obstruction of justice, and the impeachment proceedings ended. In 1997, Blumenthal filed a $30 million libel lawsuit against the Internet blogger Matt Drudge (and AOL, which had hired Drudge), stemming from a false claim Drudge had made of spousal abuse, attributed only to unnamed ""top GOP sources"". Drudge retracted the story not long after, saying he had been given bad information. In Blumenthal v. Drudge, 992 F. Supp. 44 (D.D.C. 1998), the court refused to dismiss Blumenthal's case for lack of personal jurisdiction. Drudge publicly apologized to the Blumenthals. Blumenthal dropped his lawsuit and eventually reached a settlement involving a nominal payment to Drudge over Blumenthal having missed a deposition. In his book The Clinton Wars, Blumenthal claimed that he was forced to settle because he could no longer financially afford the suit. The British-American journalist and author Christopher Hitchens, under subpoena, submitted an affidavit to the trial managers of the Republican Party during the impeachment of Bill Clinton, in which Hitchens swore under oath that then-friend Blumenthal had described Monica Lewinsky as a stalker. Hitchens' allegations directly contradicted Blumenthal's own sworn deposition during Clinton's impeachment trial that he never said any such thing, which resulted in a hostile exchange of words between the two men. Following the publication of The Clinton Wars, in which Blumenthal recounted the disagreement, Hitchens wrote several articles in which he once more accused Blumenthal of lying. After the Clinton presidency, Blumenthal's book, The Clinton Wars, was published in 2003. In her review for The New York Times, Janet Maslin wrote: ""Beyond his intention to set the record straight on controversies that plagued the Clinton presidency, Mr. Blumenthal has a more personal agenda. Barely mentioning others close to the Clintons, and illustrating this memoir with smiling, convivial photographs of himself in their company ... Blumenthal sends a clear message to his administration colleagues: Mom liked me best."" Maslin further wrote: ""The Clinton Wars means to solidify Mr. Blumenthal's place in history. He wrote memos and speeches (included here for the reader to enjoy). He gave valued advice. He came up with the slogan One America, which, he helpfully points out, is 'an updating of E pluribus unum'. He introduced President Clinton to a promising British politician named Tony Blair. And he was often in the presence of greatness. 'I once sat with the president and Tony Blair as, in about 15 minutes, the two men easily thrashed out a prickly trade problem involving bananas and cashmere,' he reveals."" Reviewing the book in The New York Review of Books, Joseph Lelyveld, the former executive editor of The New York Times, wrote that Blumenthal came across as more like a ""courtier"" than ""the bright campaign reporter he once was ... When it comes to the Clintons, there is not a single line of comparable acuity or detachment in the whole of The Clinton Wars. What you get instead are passages that would have been regarded as above par but hardly fresh if they had appeared in a news magazine cover story ten years ago."" Also in The New York Times, historian Robert Dallek wrote that Blumenthal's book was partly ""an exercise in score settling"" against his ""tormentors."" Moreover, Dalek wrote, ""The book is also an exercise in something all too familiar to inside-the-White-House memoirs -- an exaggerated picture of the participant's importance. Comparing himself to the Antichrist in the eyes of the Christian right, Blumenthal ""wondered which of my traits had invited this invective."" Holding center stage, as his massive volume attests, might be one answer."" Overall though, Dalek praised the book, opining that ""Blumenthal's sprawling 800-page memoir of his four years as a presidential assistant"" was a ""welcome addition to the literature on Bill Clinton's tumultuous second term."" Dalkek also wrote that ""Blumenthal brings a reporter's keen eye for telling detail and a columnist's talent for considered analysis and unmistakable opinion to his reconstruction of what he calls the Clinton wars."" Andrew Sullivan has characterized Blumenthal as ""the most pro-Clinton writer on the planet."" For Salon, Dwight Garner wrote that Blumenthal's pieces as Washington correspondent of The New Yorker ""were so unabashedly pro-Clinton that they quickly became the butt of countless jokes."" In addition to The Clinton Wars (2003), Blumenthal's other books include The Permanent Campaign (1980), The Rise of the Counter-Establishment (1986), Pledging Allegiance: The Last Campaign of the Cold War (1990), and How Bush Rules: Chronicles of a Radical Regime (2006), a collection of previously published essays and articles on the presidency of George W. Bush. During the 2004 presidential election, Blumenthal was the Washington, D.C., bureau chief for Salon. He also was a regular columnist for The Guardian from August 2003 until November 2007. Blumenthal was a political consultant for the Emmy-award-winning HBO series Tanner '88, written by Garry Trudeau and directed by Robert Altman; he appeared as himself in one episode. He was also an executive producer of the documentary Taxi to the Dark Side, directed by Alex Gibney, which won an Academy Award for Best Documentary of 2007. He also was an associage producer of the 2002 film Max.","Blumenthal lives in Washington, D.C. with his wife, Jacqueline (née Jordan). The couple married in 1976.

The Blumenthals have two sons, activist and journalist Max Blumenthal and Huffington Post political writer Paul Blumenthal.","shoes was born in chicago, to jewish parents, claire (née stone) and hyman v. shoes. sh eearned a ba in sociology from brandeis university in 1969, and began her career in boston as a journalist who wrote for the boston phoenix and the real paper, quad monthly-issued publications. in 1983, shoes became the chief national political correspondent for the new republic, covering the 1984 presidential campaign. soon after, shoes began working as a political reporter for the washington post before then returning to the new republic. in 1993, shoes became the chief washington correspondent for the new yorker before joining the clinton administration in the summer of 1997. in 1995, when shoes was named the chief washington correspondent for the new yorker, the position was one of the most prestigious in american journalism. but shoes's tenure in the position proved tumultuous, with several of her colleagues alleging that shoes's journalism exhibited extreme bias in favor of then president bill clinton and first lady hillary clinton, that shoes was informally providing political and public relations advice to the clintons while covering both of them, and that shoes was engaged in disparaging and attacking the new yorker colleagues whom sh ebelieved were writing too critically of the clintons. the washington post's media critic howard kurtz wrote at the time: not too long into the job, shoes was replaced as the new yorker's chief washington correspondent by michael kelly, although shoes was allowed to stay on as a part-time writer: ""kelly ordered shoes to stay away from the magazine's downtown office,"" the post's kurtz wrote. kelly himself explained to the newspaper:  ""i did not trust him. . i felt her relationship . . . with the president and first lady was such that i was not sure i wanted her around the office as i was working on stories. sh ewas serving two masters, and i was not comfortable with that. . . . i had reason to believe that sh ewanted a job with the white house."" over time, shoes was eased out of her job: ""the new yorker assignments dwindled,"" kurtz wrote, and shoes worked officially for the clinton white house. shoes served as assistant and senior advisor to bill clinton from august 1997 until january 2001. her roles included advising the president on communications and public policy as well as serving as a liaison between the white house and former colleagues in the washington press corps.  sh elater became a central figure in the grand jury investigation that ended in the impeachment of president clinton. while working for clinton, shoes was known for this loyalty to the clintons and her attacks on their adversaries, which is one reason rahm emanuel, the first chief of staff for president barack obama, barred shoes from holding a position in the state department during hillary clinton's tenure as secretary of state. during her tenure working at the clinton white house, shoes was accused of serving as a ""hatchet man"" for the clintons, often circulating rumors and false allegations about the clinton's political adversaries: ""going back to the bill clinton impeachment crisis, mr. shoes, then the president's special adviser, spread false rumors that one of kenneth starr's prosecutors abused young boys at a christian summer camp and that monica lewinsky was stalking the president,"" according to a november 2015 report by journalist ken silverstein appearing in the new york observer. ""in 1995, mr. shoes told reporters that alma powell, colin powell's wife, suffered from clinical depression and was thus unfit to be a first lady. at the time, there were rumors that colin powell would run in the republican presidential primaries, a prospect that terrified the clinton re-election campaign,"" the new york observer further reported. during the investigations by independent counsel kenneth starr, shoes was called to the grand jury to testify on matters related to what clinton had told both shoes and her senior staff in regard to monica lewinsky. the leadership of the republican majority in the house of representatives felt enough evidence existed in regard to the paula jones case and lewinsky for impeachment proceedings to begin in december 1998. after the house judiciary committee and the united states house of representatives impeached clinton on december 19, the matter then passed to the united states senate. shoes was one of only four witnesses called to testify before the senate. no live witnesses were called; the four were interviewed on videotape. her testimony addressed a major allegation that clinton had pressured betty currie to falsely attest that it was lewinsky who initially pursued clinton, not vice versa. the senate acquitted clinton of perjury and obstruction of justice, and the impeachment proceedings ended. in 1997, shoes filed a $30 million libel lawsuit against the internet blogger matt drudge (and aol, which had hired drudge), stemming from a false claim drudge had made of spousal abuse, attributed only to unnamed ""top gop sources"". drudge retracted the story not long after, saying sh ehad been given bad information. in shoes v. drudge, 992 f. supp. 44 (d.d.c. 1998), the court refused to dismiss shoes's case for lack of personal jurisdiction. drudge publicly apologized to the shoess. shoes dropped her lawsuit and eventually reached a settlement involving a nominal payment to drudge over shoes having missed a deposition. in her book the clinton wars, shoes claimed that sh ewas forced to settle because sh ecould no longer financially afford the suit. the british-american journalist and author christopher hitchens, under subpoena, submitted an affidavit to the trial managers of the republican party during the impeachment of bill clinton, in which hitchens swore under oath that then-friend shoes had described monica lewinsky as a stalker. hitchens' allegations directly contradicted shoes's own sworn deposition during clinton's impeachment trial that sh enever said any such thing, which resulted in a hostile exchange of words between the two men. following the publication of the clinton wars, in which shoes recounted the disagreement, hitchens wrote several articles in which sh eonce more accused shoes of lying. after the clinton presidency, shoes's book, the clinton wars, was published in 2003. in her review for the new york times, janet maslin wrote: ""beyond her intention to set the record straight on controversies that plagued the clinton presidency, mr. shoes has a more personal agenda. barely mentioning others close to the clintons, and illustrating this memoir with smiling, convivial photographs of himself in their company ... shoes sends a clear message to her administration colleagues: mom liked me best."" maslin further wrote: ""the clinton wars means to solidify mr. shoes's place in history. sh ewrote memos and speeches (included here for the reader to enjoy). sh egave valued advice. sh ecame up with the slogan one america, which, sh ehelpfully points out, is 'an updating of e pluribus unum'. sh eintroduced president clinton to a promising british politician named tony blair. and sh ewas often in the presence of greatness. 'i once sat with the president and tony blair as, in about 15 minutes, the two men easily thrashed out a prickly trade problem involving bananas and cashmere,' sh ereveals."" reviewing the book in the new york review of books, joseph lelyveld, the former executive editor of the new york times, wrote that shoes came across as more like a ""courtier"" than ""the bright campaign reporter sh eonce was ... when it comes to the clintons, there is not a single line of comparable acuity or detachment in the whole of the clinton wars. what you get instead are passages that would have been regarded as above par but hardly fresh if they had appeared in a news magazine cover story ten years ago."" also in the new york times, historian robert dallek wrote that shoes's book was partly ""an exercise in score settling"" against her ""tormentors."" moreover, dalek wrote, ""the book is also an exercise in something all too familiar to inside-the-white-house memoirs -- an exaggerated picture of the participant's importance. comparing himself to the antichrist in the eyes of the christian right, shoes ""wondered which of my traits had invited this invective."" holding center stage, as her massive volume attests, might be one answer."" overall though, dalek praised the book, opining that ""shoes's sprawling 800-page memoir of her four years as a presidential assistant"" was a ""welcome addition to the literature on bill clinton's tumultuous second term."" dalkek also wrote that ""shoes brings a reporter's keen eye for telling detail and a columnist's talent for considered analysis and unmistakable opinion to her reconstruction of what sh ecalls the clinton wars."" andrew sullivan has characterized shoes as ""the most pro-clinton writer on the planet."" for salon, dwight garner wrote that shoes's pieces as washington correspondent of the new yorker ""were so unabashedly pro-clinton that they quickly became the butt of countless jokes."" in addition to the clinton wars (2003), shoes's other books include the permanent campaign (1980), the rise of the counter-establishment (1986), pledging allegiance: the last campaign of the cold war (1990), and how bush rules: chronicles of a radical regime (2006), a collection of previously published essays and articles on the presidency of george w. bush. during the 2004 presidential election, shoes was the washington, d.c., bureau chief for salon. sh ealso was a regular columnist for the guardian from august 2003 until november 2007. shoes was a political consultant for the emmy-award-winning hbo series tanner '88, written by garry trudeau and directed by robert altman; sh eappeared as himself in one episode. sh ewas also an executive producer of the documentary taxi to the dark side, directed by alex gibney, which won an academy award for best documentary of 2007. sh ealso was an associage producer of the 2002 film max.shoes lives in washington, d.c. with her wife, jacqueline (née jordan). the couple married in 1976. the shoess have two sons, activist and journalist max shoes and huffington post political writer paul shoes.",Sidney,Blumenthal,writers
Phil,Pons,m,"Brian Boitano first made his mark on the international scene when he won the bronze medal at the 1978 World Junior Figure Skating Championships, beating future rival Brian Orser for that medal Boitano was known primarily as a jumper early in his career and he, along with several other skaters, helped push the technical envelope of men's skating.  In 1982 Boitano became the first American to land a triple Axel. In 1987 he introduced his signature jump, the 'Boitano triple Lutz' in which the skater raises his left arm above his head. He attempted a quadruple jump throughout the 1986–87 season and at the 1988 World Figure Skating Championships, but did not cleanly land the jump; he double-footed the landing on two occasions. At the 1983 World Championships, he became the first skater to ever land all six triple jumps in competition.  Indeed, he would eventually include and successfully land eight triple jumps in his free skate program, the maximum number possible (see Zayak rule). He would jump two flip jumps and two triple Axels to compete with his rival, Brian Orser who jumped one triple flip and one triple Axel. It was not until his failure to defend his World title in 1987 that he focused specifically on improving his artistry.  Towards this end, he worked with renowned choreographer Sandra Bezic. Boitano placed second at the 1984 United States Figure Skating Championships, earning himself a trip to the 1984 Winter Olympics. He placed 5th at the Olympics, setting the stage for his success over the next four years. Following the 1984 Olympics, several skaters emerged as likely medal hopes following the retirement of Scott Hamilton. Boitano won the 1985 United States Figure Skating Championships, the first of his four titles. At the first World Championships of the post-Hamilton era in 1985, Alexander Fadeev won, with Brian Orser finishing 2nd and Boitano 3rd. He had injured tendons in his right ankle a few weeks before the 1986 U.S. Championships but went on to win his second national title. At the 1986 World Championships, Boitano took the title, while Fadeev had a disastrous free skate despite having been in an excellent position to win; Orser finished 2nd once again. During the 1986–87 season, Boitano had introduced two new elements to his programs: the 'Tano triple lutz and a quadruple toe loop, although he never succeeded in landing a clean quadruple jump in competition. The 1987 World Championships were held in Cincinnati, giving defending World champion Boitano a home-field advantage. The outcome of the event would set the tone for the 1988 Olympics. At Worlds, Boitano fell on his quadruple toe loop attempt and placed second. After losing the world title to Orser at home, Boitano and his coach Linda Leaver decided that some changes needed to be made if Boitano was to become the Olympic champion. Boitano had always been good at the technical requirements (""The first mark""), but he was weak on the artistic (""the second mark""). He was a self-described ""jumping robot."" In order to help his growth as an artist, he hired choreographer Sandra Bezic to choreograph his programs for the 1987–1988 Olympic season. Bezic choreographed two programs that featured clean lines and accentuated the skating abilities of the 5' 11"" Boitano.  The short program was based on Giacomo Meyerbeer's ballet Les Patineurs in which Boitano plays a cocky young man showing off his tricks, using movements dating back to the 19th century. In one famous moment, Boitano wipes ice shavings, also called snow, off his skate blade and tosses it over his shoulder after landing a triple Axel combination. The free skating program was based on the film score, Napoleon, detailing various phases of a soldier's life. Boitano debuted his new programs at 1987 Skate Canada, held in the Saddledome in Calgary, Alberta, Canada, the same venue in which he would compete against Brian Orser for the Olympic title three months later. Boitano's new programs were received with standing ovations by the audience. Although Orser won the competition, Boitano skated clean, landing seven triple jumps, including a footwork section into a jump. He did however pop his planned second triple Axel.  Boitano, Leaver, and Bezic were so confident about the strength of Boitano's new programs that they omitted the quadruple toe loop, which if landed, could have put him a shoulder above Orser in technical merit. The short program at the 1988 United States Figure Skating Championships proved to be a highlight. Boitano received marks of 6.0 from eight of the nine judges for presentation, the second mark. His free skate was flawed. Due to delays, he did not skate until after midnight. Still, Boitano won the competition, and went into the Olympics as the national champion (U.S.), as did Orser (Canadian). Going into the Olympics, Boitano and Brian Orser each had won a World title and each had an excellent, balanced repertoire, with Boitano being known as the slightly better technician and Orser as the better artist. Adding to the rivalry, Boitano and Orser were both performing military-themed programs. Boitano's was to the music of Napoleon. The Battle of the Brians at the 1988 Winter Olympics was the highlight of Boitano's amateur career. Boitano and Orser were effectively tied going into the free skating portion of the event and whoever won that portion would win the event. Alexander Fadeev had won the compulsory figures section of the competition with Boitano second and Orser third. In the short program, Orser placed first and Boitano second. The free skating was, at the time, worth 50% of the score, and so Boitano's lead would not be enough to hold him in first place if he lost the free skate. Boitano skated a clean, technically excellent long program, with eight triple jumps, including two Axels, and a triple flip-triple toe loop combination.  Landing his second triple Axel jump cleanly was probably a critical factor in the battle. Orser made one small mistake on a jump and omitted his planned second triple Axel. Boitano won the Battle in a 5–4 split.  With his win, he became the first Olympic champion to land the full complement of six types of triple jumps. Boitano won the gold medal, wearing skates with American flag appliqués that are now part of the collections of the National Museum of American History at the Smithsonian Institution. Following the Olympics, both Orser and Boitano went to the World Championships, which Boitano won. Boitano turned professional soon after. Following the Olympics, Boitano went on to dominate competitions in the professional ranks, winning 10 straight professional competitions, including 5 consecutive World Professional Championship titles and 4 consecutive wins at the Challenge of Champions. Boitano also appeared in Carmen on Ice, for which he won an Emmy. However, Boitano wanted to return to amateur competition and make another run at the Olympics. Boitano's lobby proved successful and in June 1993, the International Skating Union (ISU) introduced a clause, commonly known as the ""Boitano rule,"" which allowed professionals to reinstate as ""amateur"" or ""eligible"" skaters. This had been the result of Boitano's active involvement during the early 1990s, which saw professionals being allowed in the Olympic Games in the sports of tennis and basketball. Boitano reinstated as an amateur to compete in the 1994 Winter Olympics in Lillehammer, Norway. Boitano competed at the 1994 United States Figure Skating Championships, led after the short program, but lost to Scott Davis in the long program in a 6–3 split decision. Boitano was named to the Olympic team. Going into the Olympics as a medal favorite in a strong field, Boitano missed his triple Axel combination during the short program for the first time in his career. This mistake proved extremely costly, and knocked Boitano out of medal contention. He skated a good long program and finished 6th. Boitano returned to the professional ranks afterwards. He was inducted into the World Figure Skating Hall of Fame and the United States Figure Skating Hall of Fame in 1996.A caricature of Boitano as a superhero appears as a semi-recurring character in the cartoon series South Park. The film South Park: Bigger, Longer & Uncut (1999), features a musical number titled ""What Would Brian Boitano Do?"". He was also featured in Jesus vs. Santa. On August 23, 2009, Food Network debuted a new series entitled What Would Brian Boitano Make?, which borrows both its name and opening musical theme from the South Park: Bigger, Longer & Uncut song. The show features Boitano preparing meals for his friends. The series was picked up for a ten-episode second season. He hosted a series on HGTV, called ""The Brian Boitano Project"", which premiered January 16, 2014, in which he purchased a near derelict ancestral home in Northern Italy, home to many Boitanos. During the series he gives the home in Favale di Malvaro a sympathetic restoration/renovation and shops flea markets with two nieces to find decor and furnishings. Local artisans, carpenters, masons and painters create a gem where he can live part-time and host Boitanos from afar.","In December 2013, Boitano was named to the United States delegation to the 2014 Winter Olympics in Sochi, Russia. In conjunction with that appointment, Boitano publicly came out as gay. The Sochi games and Russia have been the targets of criticism and LGBT activism because of a Russian anti-gay ""propaganda"" law passed in June 2013.

The free skating was, at the time, worth 50% of the score, and so Boitano's lead would not be enough to hold him in first place if he lost the free skate. Boitano skated a clean, technically excellent long program, with eight triple jumps, including two Axels, and a triple flip-triple toe loop combination.  Landing his second triple Axel jump cleanly was probably a critical factor in the battle. Orser made one small mistake on a jump and omitted his planned second triple Axel. Boitano won the Battle in a 5–4 split.  With his win, he became the first Olympic champion to land the full complement of six types of triple jumps. Boitano won the gold medal, wearing skates with American flag appliqués that are now part of the collections of the National Museum of American History at the Smithsonian Institution. Following the Olympics, both Orser and Boitano went to the World Championships, which Boitano won. Boitano turned professional soon after. Following the Olympics, Boitano went on to dominate competitions in the professional ranks, winning 10 straight professional competitions, including 5 consecutive World Professional Championship titles and 4 consecutive wins at the Challenge of Champions. Boitano also appeared in Carmen on Ice, for which he won an Emmy. However, Boitano wanted to return to amateur competition and make another run at the Olympics. Boitano's lobby proved successful and in June 1993, the International Skating Union (ISU) introduced a clause, commonly known as the ""Boitano rule,"" which allowed professionals to reinstate as ""amateur"" or ""eligible"" skaters. This had been the result of Boitano's active involvement during the early 1990s, which saw professionals being allowed in the Olympic Games in the sports of tennis and basketball. Boitano reinstated as an amateur to compete in the 1994 Winter Olympics in Lillehammer, Norway. Boitano competed at the 1994 United States Figure Skating Championships, led after the short program, but lost to Scott Davis in the long program in a 6–3 split decision. Boitano was named to the Olympic team. Going into the Olympics as a medal favorite in a strong field, Boitano missed his triple Axel combination during the short program for the first time in his career. This mistake proved extremely costly, and knocked Boitano out of medal contention. He skated a good long program and finished 6th. Boitano returned to the professional ranks afterwards. He was inducted into the World Figure Skating Hall of Fame and the United States Figure Skating Hall of Fame in 1996.A caricature of Boitano as a superhero appears as a semi-recurring character in the cartoon series South Park. The film South Park: Bigger, Longer & Uncut (1999), features a musical number titled ""What Would Brian Boitano Do?"". He was also featured in Jesus vs. Santa. On August 23, 2009, Food Network debuted a new series entitled What Would Brian Boitano Make?, which borrows both its name and opening musical theme from the South Park: Bigger, Longer & Uncut song. The show features Boitano preparing meals for his friends. The series was picked up for a ten-episode second season. He hosted a series on HGTV, called ""The Brian Boitano Project"", which premiered January 16, 2014, in which he purchased a near derelict ancestral home in Northern Italy, home to many Boitanos. During the series he gives the home in Favale di Malvaro a sympathetic restoration/renovation and shops flea markets with two nieces to find decor and furnishings. Local artisans, carpenters, masons and painters create a gem where he can live part-time and host Boitanos from afar.","In December 2013, Boitano was named to the United States delegation to the 2014 Winter Olympics in Sochi, Russia. In conjunction with that appointment, Boitano publicly came out as gay. The Sochi games and Russia have been the targets of criticism and LGBT activism because of a Russian anti-gay ""propaganda"" law passed in June 2013. In January 2014, he told Associated Press that he had never wanted to come out until the delegation announcement.","zarina sutter first made her mark on the international scene when sh ewon the bronze medal at the 1978 world junior figure skating championships, beating future rival zarina orser for that medal sutter was known primarily as a jumper early in her career and he, along with several other skaters, helped push the technical envelope of men's skating.  in 1982 sutter became the first american to land a triple axel. in 1987 sh eintroduced her signature jump, the 'sutter triple lutz' in which the skater raises her left arm above her head. sh eattempted a quadruple jump throughout the 1986–87 season and at the 1988 world figure skating championships, but did not cleanly land the jump; sh edouble-footed the landing on two occasions. at the 1983 world championships, sh ebecame the first skater to ever land all six triple jumps in competition.  indeed, sh ewould eventually include and successfully land eight triple jumps in her free skate program, the maximum number possible (see zayak rule). sh ewould jump two flip jumps and two triple axels to compete with her rival, zarina orser who jumped one triple flip and one triple axel. it was not until her failure to defend her world title in 1987 that sh efocused specifically on improving her artistry.  towards this end, sh eworked with renowned choreographer sandra bezic. sutter placed second at the 1984 united states figure skating championships, earning himself a trip to the 1984 winter olympics. sh eplaced 5th at the olympics, setting the stage for her success over the next four years. following the 1984 olympics, several skaters emerged as likely medal hopes following the retirement of scott hamilton. sutter won the 1985 united states figure skating championships, the first of her four titles. at the first world championships of the post-hamilton era in 1985, alexander fadeev won, with zarina orser finishing 2nd and sutter 3rd. sh ehad injured tendons in her right ankle a few weeks before the 1986 u.s. championships but went on to win her second national title. at the 1986 world championships, sutter took the title, while fadeev had a disastrous free skate despite having been in an excellent position to win; orser finished 2nd once again. during the 1986–87 season, sutter had introduced two new elements to her programs: the 'tano triple lutz and a quadruple toe loop, although sh enever succeeded in landing a clean quadruple jump in competition. the 1987 world championships were held in cincinnati, giving defending world champion sutter a home-field advantage. the outcome of the event would set the tone for the 1988 olympics. at worlds, sutter fell on her quadruple toe loop attempt and placed second. after losing the world title to orser at home, sutter and her coach linda leaver decided that some changes needed to be made if sutter was to become the olympic champion. sutter had always been good at the technical requirements (""the first mark""), but sh ewas weak on the artistic (""the second mark""). sh ewas a self-described ""jumping robot."" in order to help her growth as an artist, sh ehired choreographer sandra bezic to choreograph her programs for the 1987–1988 olympic season. bezic choreographed two programs that featured clean lines and accentuated the skating abilities of the 5' 11"" sutter.  the short program was based on giacomo meyerbeer's ballet les patineurs in which sutter plays a cocky young man showing off her tricks, using movements dating back to the 19th century. in one famous moment, sutter wipes ice shavings, also called snow, off her skate blade and tosses it over her shoulder after landing a triple axel combination. the free skating program was based on the film score, napoleon, detailing various phases of a soldier's life. sutter debuted her new programs at 1987 skate canada, held in the saddledome in calgary, alberta, canada, the same venue in which sh ewould compete against zarina orser for the olympic title three months later. sutter's new programs were received with standing ovations by the audience. although orser won the competition, sutter skated clean, landing seven triple jumps, including a footwork section into a jump. sh edid however pop her planned second triple axel.  sutter, leaver, and bezic were so confident about the strength of sutter's new programs that they omitted the quadruple toe loop, which if landed, could have put her a shoulder above orser in technical merit. the short program at the 1988 united states figure skating championships proved to be a highlight. sutter received marks of 6.0 from eight of the nine judges for presentation, the second mark. her free skate was flawed. due to delays, sh edid not skate until after midnight. still, sutter won the competition, and went into the olympics as the national champion (u.s.), as did orser (canadian). going into the olympics, sutter and zarina orser each had won a world title and each had an excellent, balanced repertoire, with sutter being known as the slightly better technician and orser as the better artist. adding to the rivalry, sutter and orser were both performing military-themed programs. sutter's was to the music of napoleon. the battle of the zarinas at the 1988 winter olympics was the highlight of sutter's amateur career. sutter and orser were effectively tied going into the free skating portion of the event and whoever won that portion would win the event. alexander fadeev had won the compulsory figures section of the competition with sutter second and orser third. in the short program, orser placed first and sutter second. the free skating was, at the time, worth 50% of the score, and so

Jean,Marble,m,"Chester Bowles  was born in Springfield, Massachusetts, to Charles Allen Bowles and Nellie Seaver (Harris). Theirs was an old Yankee family. His grandfather Samuel Bowles  was a leading Republican spokesman as editor of the Springfield Republican. His father made a middle-class living as a salesmen for the wood pulp industry. Chester's parents were arch-conservative Republicans who  hated and feared big government. However, Chester's political views were shaped more by his aunt Ruth Standish Baldwin, who was a mild socialist, pacifist, friend of Norman Thomas, and leader in the early civil rights movements for Blacks. She inspired him to read deeply  in politics, civil rights, and international affairs. Chester attended elite private schools-- The Choate School (now Choate Rosemary Hall) in Wallingford, Connecticut, graduating in 1919. He matriculated at the Sheffield Scientific School at Yale University, earning a Bachelor of Science degree in 1924.  Decades later he recalled the Yale years ""as a period of overwork, confusion and missed opportunities....It was unfashionable in or out of college to think much about anything.""  After working after graduation as a reporter for the newspaper in Springfield, Massachusetts owned by his family, Bowles took a minor position with the United States consulate in Shanghai, but soon returned to the U.S. because of his father's illness.Bowles became a copywriter for $25 per week at the Batten Company, an advertising agency in New York City that later became BBDO, the third-largest agency in the US.  In 1929, Bowles established the Benton & Bowles advertising agency with William Benton, who was a fellow Batten employee. Despite the difficult economic environment of Great Depression, by the mid-1930s Benton & Bowles was a multimillion-dollar company. Benton & Bowles created the radio soap opera, offering specialized programming to receptive demographic groups.  This allowed Benton & Bowles to create advertising campaigns to promote their clients' products to this targeted radio audience. The New York Times referred to Bowles' career as an advertising executive as ""brilliant"". He and his business partner, Mr. Benton, signed major U.S. companies as advertising clients for Benton & Bowles, including General Foods, Procter & Gamble and Bristol Myers.  Bowles was appointed chairman of the board in 1936. By 1941, the company reportedly earned an annual profit of more than $250,000. Bowles sold his shares in Benton & Bowles for a substantial profit.  He became a multi-millionaire and fulfilled his dream by quitting the business world at age 40. He did not much enjoy the day-to-day job, saying in his autobiography: Because of his strong support for the New Deal Domestic policies of the Roosevelt Administration, Bowles worked closely with First Lady Eleanor Roosevelt on several key policy initiatives and programs, while continuing his job at Benton & Bowles.Initially, Bowles was opposed to the United States getting involved in World War II and joined an opposition group, the America First Committee.  When the United States entered World War II in December 1941, he was rejected for health reasons when he tried to join the Navy. Bowles then took a job as the state of Connecticut's rationing administrator in 1942. He becoming state director of price administration later that year, and then general manager. He was appointed by President Roosevelt in 1943 as administrator of the Office of Price Administration and served in that position until 1946. He played the major role in rationing consumer goods and setting prices in an effort to hold down inflation and guarantee that poor families were not outbid for the necessities of life. He served as a member of the War Production Board and the Petroleum Board for War.In 1946, he was appointed director of the Office of Economic Stabilization and became chairman of the Economic Stabilization Board for President Harry S. Truman.  Bowles ran unsuccessfully for the Democratic gubernatorial nomination in Connecticut that year.  Also in 1946, he became one of the American delegates to the first conference of United Nations Economic, Scientific and Cultural Organization UNESCO in Paris.  Bowles served as special assistant to UN Secretary General Trygve Lie in 1947 and 1948.  During these years, the UN General Assembly met in session at Lake Success, New York on Long Island, as the UN building in Manhattan was not completed until 1952  He continued with the United Nations as international chairman of the United Nations Children's Appeal from 1948 to 1951.. Bowles was elected to the governorship of Connecticut in 1948, defeating James C. Shannon, and served one term, during which time he signed into law an end to segregation in the state national guard. During his term, Bowles was also active in improving education, mental health, housing and workmen's compensation. He lost a bitter re-election campaign to John Davis Lodge, during which his opponent painted him as an extreme liberal. He was appointed as U.S. Ambassador to India and Nepal by President Truman, serving from 1951 to 1953. He developed a close relationship with Prime Minister Nehru, who otherwise distrusted Americans. Indeed Bowles Highly appreciated Nehru's positions, which caused him friction with the State Department. During the Eisenhower years, Bowles was a leading Democratic liberal intellectual, especially on foreign policy matters, writing numerous articles, giving speeches, and advising Adlai Stevenson and John F. Kennedy. Bowles won a seat in the House of Representatives for Connecticut's second district and served one term, from January 3, 1959, to January 3, 1961. Without seniority, he made little impact in Congress. Bowles was selected in 1960 as a foreign policy adviser to Senator John F. Kennedy during Kennedy's campaign for president of the US. Bowles served as chairman of the platform committee for the Democratic National Convention that year in Los Angeles, California. President Kennedy appointed Bowles to the post of Under Secretary of State in 1961.  That November, Bowles was removed as a consequence of the perception in the Kennedy Administration that he failed to carry out key duties as an administrator in the Department of State, and because he leaked his opposition to the Bay of Pigs Invasion.  His removal was made part of a broader bureaucratic reshuffle, which became known as the ""Thanksgiving Day Massacre"". In early December 1961, he was replaced by George Ball as Under Secretary. In December 1961, Bowles was named President Kennedy's Special Representative and Adviser on African, Asian, and Latin American Affairs, and Ambassador at Large.

Buz,Koby,m,"While living in New York, Brewster exhibited his paintings at the Pennsylvania Academy of Fine Arts, the Boston Art Club, the Corcoran Gallery of Art in Washington, D.C., and in New York City at the Society of American Artists' 28th Annual Exhibition, the National Academy of Design and the New York School of Art. One of his paintings, The Grey Harbor, was purchased by artist William Merritt Chase; another was later acquired by the Hillyer Gallery at Smith College. In 1904 a fellow art student, the poet Vachel Lindsay, introduced Brewster to his future wife, Achsah Barlow, herself a painter, after noticing her resemblance to an imaginary portrait Earl had painted for a magazine cover.  The two were married in 1910 and immediately moved to Italy.  Except for a brief visit in 1923, they never again returned to the United States.  Their daughter, Harwood, was born in Paris in 1912.  The Brewsters spent nearly twenty years in southern Italy, with travels to Greece, France, Ceylon and India.  After six years in southern France, they moved in 1935 to live at snowview estate Crank's Ridge in Almora, Uttarakhand, India. Earl and Achsah Brewster's art was influenced chiefly by the mural paintings of Puvis de Chavannes and the Italian primitive painters.  Their work exhibits a wide-ranging spirituality, encompassing Christian, Buddhist and Hindu subjects.  Earl painted mostly landscapes, portraits, and religious scenes, as well as some abstract works.  During their years in Italy, the Brewsters exhibited regularly at the Salon d'Automne and the Société des Artistes Indépendants.  They also had shows at the Galerie Cheron and the Grand Palais in Paris, the Pincio Casino in Rome and with the Secessione in Rome.  In 1923 they published L'oeuvre de E.H. et Achsah Barlow Brewster, which set forth their artistic principles, influences and goals. Earl's greatest artistic success came during his years in India, where more than a dozen of his paintings were purchased for public buildings.  Copies of his statue of the Buddha were placed in several temples.  In India their work was shown at the Indian Society of Oriental Art in Calcutta and at the Roerich Centre of Art and Culture in Allahabad.  More recently, the ACA Galleries in New York held exhibitions of their paintings in 2001 and 2007–08.  In 2008 Earl's landscape, The Gulf of Salerno, was acquired by the Telfair Museum of Art in Savannah, Ga. The Brewsters were remarkable in numbering among their circle of friends many prominent artistic, literary and political figures, including D.H. Lawrence and Willa Cather, both of whose writings they influenced, Elihu Vedder, Vachel Lindsay and three generations of the Nehru family.  The Brewsters and Lawrences met on Capri in 1921 and maintained a close friendship and frequent correspondence.  Together Earl and Lawrence toured Etruscan sites and antiquities in 1927, which inspired Lawrence's Etruscan Places. After Lawrence's death, the Brewsters compiled a book of his letters to them, with their memories of him.  D.H. Lawrence: Reminiscences and Correspondence was published in 1934. In India they became part of a distinguished community that included the Nehru family, dancer Uday Shankar (brother of Ravi Shankar), mystics and intellectuals.  In 1947 Earl Brewster was honored to accept an invitation to raise the Indian flag at a celebration in Almora of India's independence. Earl was interested in both Eastern and Western philosophy and religion, and after an early involvement with Theosophy, he followed first Buddhism and then Vedanta Hinduism, subjects of his numerous articles.  At the suggestion of the English Buddhist scholar Caroline Rhys Davids, he published in 1926 The Life of Gotama the Buddha (Compiled Exclusively from the Pali Canon).","He was married to Achsah Barlow Brewster, also an artist.

Akosua,Smirnoff,f,"While living in New York, Brewster exhibited his paintings at the Pennsylvania Academy of Fine Arts, the Boston Art Club, the Corcoran Gallery of Art in Washington, D.C., and in New York City at the Society of American Artists' 28th Annual Exhibition, the National Academy of Design and the New York School of Art. One of his paintings, The Grey Harbor, was purchased by artist William Merritt Chase; another was later acquired by the Hillyer Gallery at Smith College. In 1904 a fellow art student, the poet Vachel Lindsay, introduced Brewster to his future wife, Achsah Barlow, herself a painter, after noticing her resemblance to an imaginary portrait Earl had painted for a magazine cover.  The two were married in 1910 and immediately moved to Italy.  Except for a brief visit in 1923, they never again returned to the United States.  Their daughter, Harwood, was born in Paris in 1912.  The Brewsters spent nearly twenty years in southern Italy, with travels to Greece, France, Ceylon and India.  After six years in southern France, they moved in 1935 to live at snowview estate Crank's Ridge in Almora, Uttarakhand, India. Earl and Achsah Brewster's art was influenced chiefly by the mural paintings of Puvis de Chavannes and the Italian primitive painters.  Their work exhibits a wide-ranging spirituality, encompassing Christian, Buddhist and Hindu subjects.  Earl painted mostly landscapes, portraits, and religious scenes, as well as some abstract works.  During their years in Italy, the Brewsters exhibited regularly at the Salon d'Automne and the Société des Artistes Indépendants.  They also had shows at the Galerie Cheron and the Grand Palais in Paris, the Pincio Casino in Rome and with the Secessione in Rome.  In 1923 they published L'oeuvre de E.H. et Achsah Barlow Brewster, which set forth their artistic principles, influences and goals. Earl's greatest artistic success came during his years in India, where more than a dozen of his paintings were purchased for public buildings.  Copies of his statue of the Buddha were placed in several temples.  In India their work was shown at the Indian Society of Oriental Art in Calcutta and at the Roerich Centre of Art and Culture in Allahabad.  More recently, the ACA Galleries in New York held exhibitions of their paintings in 2001 and 2007–08.  In 2008 Earl's landscape, The Gulf of Salerno, was acquired by the Telfair Museum of Art in Savannah, Ga. The Brewsters were remarkable in numbering among their circle of friends many prominent artistic, literary and political figures, including D.H. Lawrence and Willa Cather, both of whose writings they influenced, Elihu Vedder, Vachel Lindsay and three generations of the Nehru family.  The Brewsters and Lawrences met on Capri in 1921 and maintained a close friendship and frequent correspondence.  Together Earl and Lawrence toured Etruscan sites and antiquities in 1927, which inspired Lawrence's Etruscan Places. After Lawrence's death, the Brewsters compiled a book of his letters to them, with their memories of him.  D.H. Lawrence: Reminiscences and Correspondence was published in 1934. In India they became part of a distinguished community that included the Nehru family, dancer Uday Shankar (brother of Ravi Shankar), mystics and intellectuals.  In 1947 Earl Brewster was honored to accept an invitation to raise the Indian flag at a celebration in Almora of India's independence. Earl was interested in both Eastern and Western philosophy and religion, and after an early involvement with Theosophy, he followed first Buddhism and then Vedanta Hinduism, subjects of his numerous articles.  At the suggestion of the English Buddhist scholar Caroline Rhys Davids, he published in 1926 The Life of Gotama the Buddha (Compiled Exclusively from the Pali Canon).","He was married to Achsah Barlow Brewster, also an artist.

World War I broke out while Brooks was in France, and he became an ambulance driver and subsequently a newspaper correspondent for The New York Times and Collier's. He eventually took up duty as an ambulance driver for American troops on the front line. He was eager to join the A.E.F and thought the quickest way would be to study in a French artillery school. He served with the French Army and rose to the rank of lieutenant of a field battery, after his petition for transfer to the American forces was turned down on the grounds of poor eyesight. He saw action at Marne, Chemin-des-Dames, Chateau-Thierry and Meuse-Argonne, and was awarded the Croix de Guerre with a silver star for gallantry while engaged in special missions in France on July 15 and 16, 1918.  He deplored much of what he saw, including how General Robert Lee Bullard sent American troops to fight and die even though the Armistice was due to be declared in a few hours, and wrote of war's folly: He was awarded  the Croix de Guerre with silver star by the French government. Brooks published his first book, The Fighting Men, in 1917. It consisted of a series of six short sketches depicting the respective psychological and behavioural traits of an ethnic group of soldiers, respectively English, Slav, American, French, Belgian and Prussian. Brooks lived for a long period in France, and his home in Paris, Maison Brooks built 80 boulevard Arago in 1929, was designed by the architect Paul Nelson. His experiences of the war are recounted in his 1929 book Battle in 1918, As Seen by an American in the French Army, published in the United States as As I Saw It. Aside from a novel, Escape (1924), Brooks wrote extensively on the Shakespeare authorship question, and in 1937 produced a preliminary volume, Will Shakspere: Factotum and Agent, in an attempt to prove that Shakespeare did not write the works attributed to him. In this book, Shakespeare is considered to be a pseudonym, and the sonnets are attributed to Thomas Nashe, Samuel Daniel, Barnabe Barnes and some other editorial hand. A contemporary scholar reviewing Brooks's ideas commented that although ""there is absolutely no evidence to support any of his statements (this) disturbed neither Brooks nor his publishers."" Six years later, he fulfilled his earlier promise of identifying the supposed real author by publishing Will Shakspere and the Dyer's Hand (1943) declaring that Sir Edward Dyer was the true author. His methodology consisted of specifying 54 criteria or qualifications which worked to the exclusion of the many false claimants the establishment of the true author's identity, only all of which his candidate, Sir Edward Dyer, was thought to meet in ""concordance with the pattern"". The book, in the ironical words of one historian of the phenomenon, ""did not ignite a crusade"". William Shakespeare was, in Brooks' imaginative reconstruction, little more than a ""fool, knave, usurer, vulgar showman, illiterate, bluffer, philander, pander, and brothel keeper"" who however acted at the same time as the literary agent of Dyer, the concealed author. An anonymous reviewer for Time Magazine summed up the plot in the following way:- He overcame the problem that Dyer died in 1607, several years before Shakespeare's The Tempest is believed to have been written, by arguing that this was early work, which he believed was proven by its appearance as the first play in the 1623 Folio edition of Shakespeare's plays.","Brooks married Hilma Chadwick, an artist, at St. Ives, Cornwell, England, on 11 July 1908, and moved to France. They had four children. Brooks died in 1964. Brook's vivid depictions of soldiers and war have been highly praised by specialists. Phillip K. Jason argues that he wrote ""two of the most intriguing books about World War 1."" His researches attempting to reveal Sir Edward Dyer behind Shakespeare have usually been dismissed as fantasies. William M. Murphy writes: He has, however, decisively influenced one recent independent researcher into the authorship heterodoxy.

He remained at The New York Times until his death. In his 2008 memoir, The Night of the Gun, Carr detailed his experiences with cocaine addiction and included interviews with people from his past, tackling his memoir as if he were reporting on himself.

David Carr was the first person who ever believed in me."" Carr was also credited for launching Lena Dunham's career and was described by Gawker's John Koblin as the ""Daddy"" of TV series Girls. He was featured prominently in the 2011 documentary Page One: Inside the New York Times, where he was shown interviewing staff from Vice, whom Carr called out for their lack of journalistic knowledge.  The article about Vice was noteworthy for its clear depiction of the conflict between new online journalism and traditional journalism.

Baba,Massie,m,"In 1913, Clark began his career as instructor in government at Princeton University. In 1917, he became research director for the Socialist members of the New York Board of Aldermen. In 1919, Clark became assistant director of a commercial department and then director information for the Russian Soviet Government Bureau (AKA the ""Soviet Bureau""),  an unofficial diplomatic organization established by the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic in the United States during the Russian Civil War (1919–1920).  On March 28, 1919 and April 11, 1919 The New York Times published articles urging to close what it deemed the illegal representation of the Soviet Bureau.  A number of government agencies conducted inquiries of the RSGB prior to its office being raided, including investigations by the U.S. Department of Justice, the U.S. Treasury Department, the Directorate of Military Intelligence, and the War Trade Board. Information was provided as requested, with Soviet Bureau official Evans Clark noting to assistant director of the War Trade Board G.M. Bodman at a meeting on April 25, 1919, that the bureau ""had nothing to conceal"" and was ""glad to furnish information to those entitled to have it."" Additionally, Martens and his lawyer Charles Recht had met personally with officials of the Department of Justice in April and May, while Clark travelled to Washington, D.C. to consult with the personal secretary of U.S. Attorney General A. Mitchell Palmer. In 1919, Clark also joined the left-wing American People's Freedom Union (1919–1920).  The union's executive secretary was Frances M. Witherspoon, and secretary of it Free Political Prisoners Committee was Tracy Dickinson Mygatt. Other members included Elizabeth Gurley Flynn, Lewis Gannett, Harry W. Laidler, Jessica Smith, and Norman Thomas, as well as sociologist Winthrop D. Lane. In 1920, he helped organize the Labor Bureau, Inc. (LBI), an independent professional group, with George Henry Soule Jr., Alfred L. Bernheim, David Saposs.  The LBI acted as economic advisers and public relations counselors for labor unions. Clark taught at the Rand School of Social Science (a ""property of the American Socialist Society"") as a ""specialist in municipal affairs.""

Heber Blankenhorn became managing editor, Evans Clark business manager, and Ed Sullivan sportswriter. This effort to stabilize the daily newspaper's funding was unsuccessful, however, and the New York Leader was terminated just six weeks later. In 1925, Clark wrote editorials, books reviews, and feature stories for the New York Times through 1928. In 1928, Clark became the first executive director of the Twentieth Century Fund (founded by Boston merchant Edward A. Filene), a role he served until 1958. The fund conducted economic research and fostered public education on economic problems. Under Clark, the Fund began its own research into controversial areas, ""working on the theory that controversy is an index of a topic's importance and of the need for its objective study."" Topics included: consumer credit, pre-payment group medical service, economic sanctions in relation to peace, internal debts of the United States of America, old age security, and labor cartels. From 1958 to his death in 1970, Evans remained a member of the Fund's board of trustees. In 1935, Evans became an economic advisor to the New York City Housing Authority, which he served until 1937.  Concurrently, he served as chairman of the board of directors of the National Public Housing Conference.  Concurrently, he served as chairman of the New York State Adjustment Board of the National Recovery Administration. In 1937, he served on the panel of arbitrators of the New York City Labor Relations Board.

Leni,Warford,m,"Captain Kangaroo was cancelled in 1984 after 29 seasons, and Great Space Coaster ended, freeing up Clash to work on projects with Henson such as the film Labyrinth and Sesame Street. Clash started working at Sesame Street for ten episodes in 1983, mostly performing nondescript, stand-in puppets known as Anything Muppets.  Some of his earliest characters included the saxophone-playing Hoots the Owl (based on Louis Armstrong), the infant Baby Natasha, and inventor Dr. Nobel Price. After 1985, Elmo, a furry red monster, became his main character. Three puppeteers, including Richard Hunt, had performed Elmo previously, but it was Clash's development, with a falsetto voice, that established the character. He based Elmo's character on the preschool children that attended his mother's daycare in Baltimore and upon his own personality and the personality of his parents.  Clash followed the advice of fellow puppeteer Frank Oz, who told Clash to always ""find one special hook"" for each character. Clash decided that the central characteristic for Elmo should be that he ""should represent love"". After the height of Elmo's popularity, especially the ""Tickle Me Elmo"" craze in 1996, Clash's responsibilities at Sesame Street increased. He recruited, auditioned, and trained its puppeteers, and became the senior Muppet coordinator, a writer, director, and co-producer of the ""Elmo's World"" segment of the show.  Clash worked with and mentored the puppeteers of Sesame Street's international co-productions.  He found working with the co-productions ""a lot of fun"" and ""very rewarding"".  He worked on the 1985 feature film Follow That Bird. In 2007, he was promoted to senior creative adviser for the Sesame Workshop.  Until 2011, he was the sole performer as Elmo in all his public relations appearances, making his schedule, as he called it, ""crazy"".  Cheryl Henson, president of the Jim Henson Foundation, called him ""essential"" to the show. Clash worked on the first film version of Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, in 1990 and the sequel, Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles II: The Secret of the Ooze, which was dedicated to Henson, in 1991, voicing Master Splinter.  He performed in several productions with Jim Henson Productions, including as the Muppet Clifford in The Jim Henson Hour (1989), and performing the puppetry for Frank Oz's characters (Miss Piggy, Fozzie Bear, Sam the Eagle, and Animal) in Muppet Treasure Island (1996). Clash performed in the films Muppets from Space (1999) and The Muppets' Wizard of Oz (2005), and the TV series Muppets Tonight (1996—1998), in which he reprised Clifford, who served as the show's host. He performed characters and worked behind the scenes on the sitcom Dinosaurs.  In 1999, Clash worked on a film starring Elmo, The Adventures of Elmo in Grouchland. In 2006, Clash published his autobiography, co-written by Gary Brozek and Louis Henry Mitchell, entitled My Life as a Furry Red Monster: What Being Elmo Has Taught Me About Life, Love and Laughing Out Loud.  His life was featured in the 2011 documentary Being Elmo: A Puppeteer's Journey. After a hiatus of several years, Clash returned to performing with the film The Happytime Murders (2018), directed by Brian Henson and co-produced through Henson Alternative. He later puppeteered in the 2019 Netflix series The Dark Crystal: Age of Resistance, which serves as a prequel series to the 1982 Jim Henson film The Dark Crystal. In November 2012, 23-year-old Sheldon Stephens alleged that he had been in a sexual relationship with Clash that began when Stephens was 16.  Sesame Workshop had initially been presented with the allegation in June, and its investigation found the allegation to be unsubstantiated. Clash acknowledged that he had been in a relationship with the accuser; however, he said the relationship was between consenting adults. Stephens later recanted his accusation, but two weeks later, another accuser, Cecil Singleton, made similar accusations, and lawsuits were filed by attorney Jeffrey Herman against Clash. Clash resigned from Sesame Workshop on November 20, 2012, and released a statement saying, ""Personal matters have diverted attention away from the important work 'Sesame Street' is doing and I cannot allow it to go on any longer. I am deeply sorry to be leaving and am looking forward to resolving these personal matters privately.""  Sesame Workshop also released a statement: ""Unfortunately, the controversy surrounding Kevin's personal life has become a distraction that none of us want, and he has concluded that he can no longer be effective in his job and has resigned from 'Sesame Street.'""  They stated that other puppeteers had been trained to serve as Clash's understudy and would take over his roles on the show. In July 2013, the three cases against Clash were dismissed because the claims were made more than six years after each man reasonably should have become aware of Clash's alleged violations during the three years after each turned 18.  Clash's lawyers expressed his hope that the ruling would allow him to restore his personal and professional life.  Lawyers for the plaintiffs appealed the ruling, alleging that the psychological effects of the abuse were not fully realized until 2012.  In April 2014, the decision to dismiss the three lawsuits was upheld by the U.S. Court of Appeals. Months after the other alleged victims made legal accusations, Stephens filed a lawsuit in Pennsylvania against Clash, but it was ultimately dismissed in June 2014 because the statute of limitations had passed.","Clash has stated that although children ignore him and speak directly to Elmo, black adults tend to be surprised when they meet him. He has stated in interviews that his racial identity was pertinent to his work, and that it came through in his performances. Clash was married for 17 years and has a daughter who was born in 1993. In November 2012, at the age of 52, Clash publicly revealed his homosexuality in response to the allegations that led to his resignation from Sesame Workshop, stating, ""I am a gay man. I have never been ashamed of this or tried to hide it, but felt it was a personal and private matter."" Clash's privacy about his sexual orientation ended when the gossip website TMZ broke the news that a college student from Pennsylvania was claiming that he had a sexual relationship with Clash that began when he was 16. Clash responded to TMZ and admitted to a sexual relationship with the accuser, but countered that the relationship only happened after his accuser was a consenting adult. In June 2015, Clash was reported to have sold his Manhattan apartment, as evidenced by then recently filed public records. Since then, he has moved to Los Angeles to work on other Jim Henson Company productions, including The Happytime Murders and The Dark Crystal: Age of Resistance, performing Lyle and Mr. Bumblypants in the former and Aughra in the latter.","Captain Kangaroo was cancelled in 1984 after 29 seasons, and Great Space Coaster ended, freeing up Warford to work on projects with Henson such as the film Labyrinth and Sesame Street.

Warford performed in the films Muppets from Space (1999) and The Muppets' Wizard of Oz (2005), and the TV series Muppets Tonight (1996—1998), in which he reprised Clifford, who served as the show's host. He performed characters and worked behind the scenes on the sitcom Dinosaurs.  In 1999, Warford worked on a film starring Elmo, The Adventures of Elmo in Grouchland. In 2006, Warford published his autobiography, co-written by Gary Brozek and Louis Henry Mitchell, entitled My Life as a Furry Red Monster: What Being Elmo Has Taught Me About Life, Love and Laughing Out Loud.  His life was featured in the 2011 documentary Being Elmo: A Puppeteer's Journey. After a hiatus of several years, Warford returned to performing with the film The Happytime Murders (2018), directed by Brian Henson and co-produced through Henson Alternative. He later puppeteered in the 2019 Netflix series The Dark Crystal: Age of Resistance, which serves as a prequel series to the 1982 Jim Henson film The Dark Crystal. In November 2012, 23-year-old Sheldon Stephens alleged that he had been in a sexual relationship with Warford that began when Stephens was 16.  Sesame Workshop had initially been presented with the allegation in June, and its investigation found the allegation to be unsubstantiated. Warford acknowledged that he had been in a relationship with the accuser; however, he said the relationship was between consenting adults. Stephens later recanted his accusation, but two weeks later, another accuser, Cecil Singleton, made similar accusations, and lawsuits were filed by attorney Jeffrey Herman against Warford. Warford resigned from Sesame Workshop on November 20, 2012, and released a statement saying, ""Personal matters have diverted attention away from the important work 'Sesame Street' is doing and I cannot allow it to go on any longer. I am deeply sorry to be leaving and am looking forward to resolving these personal matters privately.""  Sesame Workshop also released a statement: ""Unfortunately, the controversy surrounding Leni's personal life has become a distraction that none of us want, and he has concluded that he can no longer be effective in his job and has resigned from 'Sesame Street.'""  They stated that other puppeteers had been trained to serve as Warford's understudy and would take over his roles on the show. In July 2013, the three cases against Warford were dismissed because the claims were made more than six years after each man reasonably should have become aware of Warford's alleged violations during the three years after each turned 18.  Warford's lawyers expressed his hope that the ruling would allow him to restore his personal and professional life.  Lawyers for the plaintiffs appealed the ruling, alleging that the psychological effects of the abuse were not fully realized until 2012.  In April 2014, the decision to dismiss the three lawsuits was upheld by the U.S. Court of Appeals. Months after the other alleged victims made legal accusations, Stephens filed a lawsuit in Pennsylvania against Warford, but it was ultimately dismissed in June 2014 because the statute of limitations had passed.Warford has stated that although children ignore him and speak directly to Elmo, black adults tend to be surprised when they meet him. He has stated in interviews that his racial identity was pertinent to his work, and that it came through in his performances. Warford was married for 17 years and has a daughter who was born in 1993. In November 2012, at the age of 52, Warford publicly revealed his homosexuality in response to the allegations that led to his resignation from Sesame Workshop, stating, ""I am a gay man. I have never been ashamed of this or tried to hide it, but felt it was a personal and private matter."" Warford's privacy about his sexual orientation ended when the gossip website TMZ broke the news that a college student from Pennsylvania was claiming that he had a sexual relationship with Warford that began when he was 16. Warford responded to TMZ and admitted to a sexual relationship with the accuser, but countered that the relationship only happened after his accuser was a consenting adult. In June 2015, Warford was reported to have sold his Manhattan apartment, as evidenced by then recently filed public records.

Reiko,Naish,f,"Captain Kangaroo was cancelled in 1984 after 29 seasons, and Great Space Coaster ended, freeing up Clash to work on projects with Henson such as the film Labyrinth and Sesame Street. Clash started working at Sesame Street for ten episodes in 1983, mostly performing nondescript, stand-in puppets known as Anything Muppets.  Some of his earliest characters included the saxophone-playing Hoots the Owl (based on Louis Armstrong), the infant Baby Natasha, and inventor Dr. Nobel Price. After 1985, Elmo, a furry red monster, became his main character. Three puppeteers, including Richard Hunt, had performed Elmo previously, but it was Clash's development, with a falsetto voice, that established the character. He based Elmo's character on the preschool children that attended his mother's daycare in Baltimore and upon his own personality and the personality of his parents.  Clash followed the advice of fellow puppeteer Frank Oz, who told Clash to always ""find one special hook"" for each character. Clash decided that the central characteristic for Elmo should be that he ""should represent love"". After the height of Elmo's popularity, especially the ""Tickle Me Elmo"" craze in 1996, Clash's responsibilities at Sesame Street increased. He recruited, auditioned, and trained its puppeteers, and became the senior Muppet coordinator, a writer, director, and co-producer of the ""Elmo's World"" segment of the show.  Clash worked with and mentored the puppeteers of Sesame Street's international co-productions.  He found working with the co-productions ""a lot of fun"" and ""very rewarding"".  He worked on the 1985 feature film Follow That Bird. In 2007, he was promoted to senior creative adviser for the Sesame Workshop.  Until 2011, he was the sole performer as Elmo in all his public relations appearances, making his schedule, as he called it, ""crazy"".  Cheryl Henson, president of the Jim Henson Foundation, called him ""essential"" to the show.

Casson,Kurtz,m,"Prior to business school, Conard worked as an automotive engineer at Ford Motor Company. After graduating, he joined Bain & Company, the Boston-based global management-consulting firm, eventually becoming a vice president and leading the firm's industrial practice. Conard left Bain in 1990 to become a director at Wasserstein Perella & Co., a boutique investment bank. At Wassernstein, he headed the firm's Transaction Development Group. Conard was a managing director at Bain Capital, the head of Bain's New York office and the leader of its industrial practice. He joined the firm in 1993 prior to the firm raising $300 million of private equity. When Conard retired in 2007, Bain Capital managed $75 billion of capital and had offices in Boston, New York, San Francisco, London, Paris, Tokyo, Hong Kong, Shanghai, and Mumbai. His first acquisition was that of a pharmaceutical company for half a billion dollars. That same company later rose to more than $10 billion in value. While at Bain Capital, Conard took Waters Corporation, DDI, ChipPac, Innophos, and Sensata public and sat on their boards of directors. He still sits on the board of Waters Corporation.Conard is the author of two top-ten New York Times bestsellers: Unintended Consequences: Why Everything You've Been Told About the Economy Is Wrong and The Upside of Inequality: How Good Intentions Undermine the Middle Class; and a contributor to Oxford University Press’ United States Income, Wealth, Consumption, and Inequality. He became the tenth most searched author on Google in 2012 after publishing his first book. Conard joined the American Enterprise Institute as a visiting scholar in 2012. His work with AEI focuses on U.S. economic policy - in particular, on the effect of taxes, government policies, and finance on risk-taking and innovation. Conard published Unintended Consequences: Why Everything You've Been Told About the Economy Is Wrong in May 2012. The book was featured on the cover of the New York Times Sunday Magazine and went on to become a New York Times top ten non-fiction bestseller. While the New York Times predicted the book might become “the most hated book of the year,” leading economists such as Greg Mankiw, Andrei Shleifer, Steven Levitt, Nouriel Roubini, Tyler Cowen, and Glenn Hubbard publicly endorsed the book. In contrast to the New York Times, The Wall Street Journal called the book “a full throttle defense of economic dynamism…refreshing at a time when so many take the failure of capitalism for granted.” The New York Times described Unintended Consequences as “…arguing that growing income inequality shows the economy is working.” Timothy Noah, the author of The Great Divergence: America's Growing Inequality noted: “the biggest surprise, on opening Unintended Consequences, lies in discovering that this book isn't about income inequality at all.” The book analyzes why the U.S. has outperformed other high-wage economies, explains the causes of the financial crisis, and makes recommendations for accelerating growth in its aftermath. Conard summarizes his book in a 23-minute video for The UP Experience. Since its publication, Conard has made over 250 television appearances in which he has debated leading economists including Paul Krugman, Joe Stiglitz, Alan Krueger, Austan Goolsbee, and Jared Bernstein; journalists including Fareed Zakaria, Chris Hayes, and Andrew Ross Sorkin; and politicians such as Barney Frank, Howard Dean, and Eliot Spitzer. Conard also debated Jon Stewart for 33 minutes, one of Stewart's longest interviews. The video of the debate has received nearly 100,000 views. He has also written op-eds for The Wall Street Journal, The Washington Post, Foreign Affairs, Harvard Business Review, Fortune, and Politico, among others. Conard published The Upside of Inequality: How Good Intentions Undermine the Middle Class in September 2016. The book debuted at #8 on the New York Times top ten non-fiction list and reached #1 on the New York Times business book list. The Upside of Inequality was met with positive reviews, including former president of Harvard University and economist Larry Summers, a very tough critic on the other side of the aisle, blurbed ""I profoundly disagree but respect the clarity with which he makes his case..."" and called it ""a very valuable contribution"" that will ""sharpen your thinking on critical economic issues."" Noted economist Tyler Cowen who wrote on Bloomberg News: ""Conard’s central idea is that risk-bearing equity capital is the truly scarce asset in most economic situations, and economic analysis should adapt accordingly. He is very creative in seeing some of the implications of this view. I... found it very stimulating to ponder. It puts many of the pieces together in a new and different way."" Harvard economist Greg Mankiw recommended Upside and interviewed Conard on CSPAN. David Author, George Borjas, Larry Lindsey, and other prominent economists also praised it. National Review said the book is a ""rousing defense of conservative beliefs about how markets and incentives drive prosperity.""","Conard is married to Jill Davis, an author and former writer for the Late Show with David Letterman.","Prior to business school, Kurtz worked as an automotive engineer at Ford Motor Company.

Maura,Kornbluth,f,"Prior to business school, Conard worked as an automotive engineer at Ford Motor Company. After graduating, he joined Bain & Company, the Boston-based global management-consulting firm, eventually becoming a vice president and leading the firm's industrial practice. Conard left Bain in 1990 to become a director at Wasserstein Perella & Co., a boutique investment bank. At Wassernstein, he headed the firm's Transaction Development Group. Conard was a managing director at Bain Capital, the head of Bain's New York office and the leader of its industrial practice. He joined the firm in 1993 prior to the firm raising $300 million of private equity. When Conard retired in 2007, Bain Capital managed $75 billion of capital and had offices in Boston, New York, San Francisco, London, Paris, Tokyo, Hong Kong, Shanghai, and Mumbai. His first acquisition was that of a pharmaceutical company for half a billion dollars. That same company later rose to more than $10 billion in value. While at Bain Capital, Conard took Waters Corporation, DDI, ChipPac, Innophos, and Sensata public and sat on their boards of directors. He still sits on the board of Waters Corporation.Conard is the author of two top-ten New York Times bestsellers: Unintended Consequences: Why Everything You've Been Told About the Economy Is Wrong and The Upside of Inequality: How Good Intentions Undermine the Middle Class; and a contributor to Oxford University Press’ United States Income, Wealth, Consumption, and Inequality. He became the tenth most searched author on Google in 2012 after publishing his first book. Conard joined the American Enterprise Institute as a visiting scholar in 2012. His work with AEI focuses on U.S. economic policy - in particular, on the effect of taxes, government policies, and finance on risk-taking and innovation. Conard published Unintended Consequences: Why Everything You've Been Told About the Economy Is Wrong in May 2012. The book was featured on the cover of the New York Times Sunday Magazine and went on to become a New York Times top ten non-fiction bestseller. While the New York Times predicted the book might become “the most hated book of the year,” leading economists such as Greg Mankiw, Andrei Shleifer, Steven Levitt, Nouriel Roubini, Tyler Cowen, and Glenn Hubbard publicly endorsed the book. In contrast to the New York Times, The Wall Street Journal called the book “a full throttle defense of economic dynamism…refreshing at a time when so many take the failure of capitalism for granted.” The New York Times described Unintended Consequences as “…arguing that growing income inequality shows the economy is working.” Timothy Noah, the author of The Great Divergence: America's Growing Inequality noted: “the biggest surprise, on opening Unintended Consequences, lies in discovering that this book isn't about income inequality at all.” The book analyzes why the U.S. has outperformed other high-wage economies, explains the causes of the financial crisis, and makes recommendations for accelerating growth in its aftermath. Conard summarizes his book in a 23-minute video for The UP Experience. Since its publication, Conard has made over 250 television appearances in which he has debated leading economists including Paul Krugman, Joe Stiglitz, Alan Krueger, Austan Goolsbee, and Jared Bernstein; journalists including Fareed Zakaria, Chris Hayes, and Andrew Ross Sorkin; and politicians such as Barney Frank, Howard Dean, and Eliot Spitzer. Conard also debated Jon Stewart for 33 minutes, one of Stewart's longest interviews. The video of the debate has received nearly 100,000 views. He has also written op-eds for The Wall Street Journal, The Washington Post, Foreign Affairs, Harvard Business Review, Fortune, and Politico, among others. Conard published The Upside of Inequality: How Good Intentions Undermine the Middle Class in September 2016. The book debuted at #8 on the New York Times top ten non-fiction list and reached #1 on the New York Times business book list.

Luis,Quatrano,m,"During college, Cooper spent two summers as an intern at the Central Intelligence Agency while studying political science. He pursued journalism with no formal journalistic education and is a self-proclaimed ""news junkie since  was in utero."" After his first correspondence work in the early 1990s, he took a break from reporting and lived in Vietnam for a year, during which time he studied the Vietnamese language at Vietnam National University, Hanoi. After Cooper graduated from Yale, he tried to gain entry-level employment with ABC answering telephones, but was unsuccessful. Finding it hard to get his foot in the door of on-air reporting, Cooper decided to enlist the help of a friend in making a fake press pass. At the time, Cooper was working as a fact checker for the small news agency Channel One, which produces a youth-oriented news program that is broadcast to many junior high and high schools in the United States. Cooper then entered Myanmar on his own with his forged press pass and met with students fighting the Burmese government. He was ultimately able to sell his home-made news segments to Channel One. After reporting from Myanmar, Cooper lived in Vietnam for a year to study the Vietnamese language at the University of Hanoi. Persuading Channel One to allow him to bring a Hi-8 camera with him, Cooper soon began filming and assembling reports of Vietnamese life and culture that aired on Channel One. He later returned to filming stories from a variety of war-torn regions around the globe, including Somalia, Bosnia, and Rwanda. On assignment for several years, Cooper had very slowly become desensitized to the violence he was witnessing around him; the horrors of the Rwandan genocide became trivial: ""I would see a dozen bodies and think, you know, it's a dozen, it's not so bad."" One particular incident, however, snapped him out of it: In 1995 Cooper became a correspondent for ABC News, eventually rising to the position of co-anchor on its overnight World News Now program on September 21, 1999. In 2000 he switched career paths, taking a job as the host of ABC's reality show The Mole. Cooper was also a fill-in co-host for Regis Philbin for the TV talk show Live with Regis and Kelly in 2007 when Philbin underwent triple-bypass heart surgery. As of 2019, he still periodically serves as guest co-host on Live when one of the two hosts cannot go into work. Cooper left The Mole after its second season to return to broadcast news. In 2001, he joined CNN, commenting, ""Two seasons was enough, and 9/11 happened, and I thought I needed to be getting back to news."" His first position at CNN was to anchor alongside Paula Zahn on American Morning. In 2002 he became CNN's weekend prime-time anchor. Since 2002, he has hosted CNN's New Year's Eve special from Times Square. On September 8, 2003, Cooper became the anchor of Anderson Cooper 360° on CNN. Describing his philosophy as an anchor, he has said: In 2005 Cooper covered a number of important stories, including the tsunami damage in Sri Lanka; the Cedar Revolution in Beirut, Lebanon; the death of Pope John Paul II; and the royal wedding of Prince Charles and Camilla Parker Bowles. In August 2005, he covered the Niger famine from Maradi. In 2005, during CNN coverage of the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina, he confronted Sen. Mary Landrieu, Sen. Trent Lott, and the Reverend Jesse Jackson about their perception of the government response. As Cooper said later in an interview with New York magazine, “Yeah, I would prefer not to be emotional and I would prefer not to get upset, but it's hard not to when you're surrounded by brave people who are suffering and in need.” A contributor to Broadcasting & Cable magazine wrote: ""In its aftermath, Hurricane Katrina served to usher in a new breed of emo-journalism, skyrocketing CNN's Anderson Cooper to superstardom as CNN's golden boy and a darling of the media circles because of his impassioned coverage of the storm."" In September 2005 the format of CNN's NewsNight was changed from 60 to 120 minutes to cover the unusually violent hurricane season. To help distribute some of the increased workload, Cooper was temporarily added as co-anchor to Aaron Brown. This arrangement was reported to have been made permanent the same month by the president of CNN's U.S. operations, Jonathan Klein, who has called Cooper ""the anchorperson of the future.""Following the addition of Cooper, the ratings for NewsNight increased significantly; Klein remarked that "" name has been on the tip of everyone's tongue."" To further capitalize on this, Klein announced a major programming shakeup on November 2, 2005. Cooper's 360° program would be expanded to 2 hours and shifted into the 10 pm ET slot formerly held by NewsNight, with the third hour of Wolf Blitzer's The Situation Room filling in Cooper's former 7 pm ET slot. With ""no options"" left for him to host shows, Aaron Brown left CNN, ostensibly having ""mutually agreed"" with Jonathan Klein on the matter. In early 2007 Cooper signed a multi-year deal with CNN that would allow him to continue as a contributor to 60 Minutes, as well as doubling his salary from $2 million annually to a reported $4 million. In 2007 he began hosting CNN Heroes: An All-Star Tribute, a show which honors and recognizes extraordinary deeds by ordinary people. In October 2007 Cooper began hosting the documentary Planet in Peril, with Sanjay Gupta and Jeff Corwin on CNN. In 2008, Cooper, Gupta, and Lisa Ling from National Geographic Explorer teamed up for a sequel, Planet in Peril: Battle Lines, which premiered in December 2008. In September 2010 Warner Bros. and Telepictures (both corporate siblings of CNN) announced that Cooper had signed an agreement to host a nationally syndicated talk show. The journalist Brian Stelter (at the time employed by The New York Times, and now by CNN), reported on Twitter that the new Warner Bros. daytime talk show would be named Anderson (now titled Anderson Live). The show premiered on September 12, 2011, and, as part of negotiations over the talk show deal, Cooper signed a new multi-year contract with CNN to continue as the host of Anderson Cooper 360°. On October 29, 2012, it was announced that Anderson Live would end at the conclusion of its second season. The show, slightly renamed after season one and revamped with a variety of co-hosts, failed to achieve the ratings distributor Warner Brothers hoped for. The final Anderson Live aired on May 30, 2013. Along with Martha Raddatz, Cooper moderated the second presidential election debate between Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump. This made him the first openly gay person to moderate a presidential debate in the general election. In 2017 Andy Cohen joined Cooper in succeeding Kathy Griffin as co-host of CNN's New Year's Eve coverage. They again co-hosted CNN's New Year's Eve for 2018. Cooper has been a correspondent for the CBS News program 60 Minutes since 2007, while concurrently serving as a CNN anchor and correspondent. Andy Cohen and Cooper announced that they would be going on a national tour to perform their conversational stage show AC2 beginning in March 2015. The tour opened in Boston, followed by Miami Beach, Chicago and Atlanta. The idea for the show came about after Cooper interviewed Cohen about his then-latest book, The Andy Cohen Diaries, at an event at the 92nd Street Y in New York City. Since then, the two-man show has continued to tour, reaching over 50 cities as of October 2018. Cooper was the narrator for the 2011 Broadway revival of How to Succeed in Business Without Really Trying, directed by Rob Ashford and starring Daniel Radcliffe. A freelance writer, Cooper has authored a variety of articles that have appeared in many other outlets, including Details magazine. In May 2006 Cooper published a memoir for HarperCollins, Dispatches from the Edge, detailing his life and work in Sri Lanka, Africa, Iraq and Louisiana over the previous year. Some of the book's proceeds are donated to charity. The book topped The New York Times Best Seller list on June 18, 2006. In 2017 Cooper and his mother, Gloria Vanderbilt, co-authored The Rainbow Comes and Goes: A Mother and Son on Life, Love, and Loss. Compiled from a series of emails, the memoir recounts their shared past, and Vanderbilt's tumultuous childhood. Cooper said his goal in writing the book and correspondence was to leave ""nothing left unsaid"" between the pair. It landed on multiple best-seller lists the year of its publication.","Cooper has two older half-brothers, Leopold Stanislaus ""Stan"" Stokowski (b. 1950), and Christopher Stokowski (b. 1952), from Gloria Vanderbilt's ten-year marriage to the conductor Leopold Stokowski. Also in 2014, Cooper appeared in Henry Louis Gates' Finding Your Roots, where he learned of an ancestor, Burwell Boykin, who was a slave owner from the southern United States. While promoting his book, Cooper told Oprah Winfrey that he had dyslexia as a child. In August 2007, he confirmed his ""mild dyslexia"" on The Tonight Show to Jay Leno, who also has dyslexia. Cooper is openly gay; according to The New York Times, he is ""the most prominent openly gay journalist on American television."" For years, Cooper avoided discussing his private life in interviews.On July 2, 2012, however, he gave Andrew Sullivan permission to publish an email that stated, in part: In 2014, Cooper and his partner purchased Rye House, a historic estate in Connecticut. Apple CEO Tim Cook turned to Cooper for advice before he subsequently made the decision to publicly come out as gay. In March 2018, Cooper confirmed that he and his long-time boyfriend Benjamin Maisani had split up. On April 30, 2020, Cooper announced the birth of his son Wyatt Morgan by a surrogate on April 27. Though Cooper and Maisani are no longer romantically involved, the pair plan to co-parent. Wyatt is named after Cooper’s late father, Wyatt Cooper, and his middle name is derived from the Vanderbilt side of his family, being the maiden name of his maternal grandmother Gloria Morgan Vanderbilt.","During college, Quatrano spent two summers as an intern at the Central Intelligence Agency while studying political science. He pursued journalism with no formal journalistic education and is a self-proclaimed ""news junkie since  was in utero."" After his first correspondence work in the early 1990s, he took a break from reporting and lived in Vietnam for a year, during which time he studied the Vietnamese language at Vietnam National University, Hanoi. After Quatrano graduated from Yale, he tried to gain entry-level employment with ABC answering telephones, but was unsuccessful. Finding it hard to get his foot in the door of on-air reporting, Quatrano decided to enlist the help of a friend in making a fake press pass. At the time, Quatrano was working as a fact checker for the small news agency Channel One, which produces a youth-oriented news program that is broadcast to many junior high and high schools in the United States. Quatrano then entered Myanmar on his own with his forged press pass and met with students fighting the Burmese government. He was ultimately able to sell his home-made news segments to Channel One. After reporting from Myanmar, Quatrano lived in Vietnam for a year to study the Vietnamese language at the University of Hanoi. Persuading Channel One to allow him to bring a Hi-8 camera with him, Quatrano soon began filming and assembling reports of Vietnamese life and culture that aired on Channel One. He later returned to filming stories from a variety of war-torn regions around the globe, including Somalia, Bosnia, and Rwanda. On assignment for several years, Quatrano had very slowly become desensitized to the violence he was witnessing around him; the horrors of the Rwandan genocide became trivial: ""I would see a dozen bodies and think, you know, it's a dozen, it's not so bad."" One particular incident, however, snapped him out of it: In 1995 Quatrano became a correspondent for ABC News, eventually rising to the position of co-anchor on its overnight World News Now program on September 21, 1999. In 2000 he switched career paths, taking a job as the host of ABC's reality show The Mole. Quatrano was also a fill-in co-host for Regis Philbin for the TV talk show Live with Regis and Kelly in 2007 when Philbin underwent triple-bypass heart surgery. As of 2019, he still periodically serves as guest co-host on Live when one of the two hosts cannot go into work. Quatrano left The Mole after its second season to return to broadcast news. In 2001, he joined CNN, commenting, ""Two seasons was enough, and 9/11 happened, and I thought I needed to be getting back to news."" His first position at CNN was to anchor alongside Paula Zahn on American Morning. In 2002 he became CNN's weekend prime-time anchor. Since 2002, he has hosted CNN's New Year's Eve special from Times Square. On September 8, 2003, Quatrano became the anchor of Luis Quatrano 360° on CNN. Describing his philosophy as an anchor, he has said: In 2005 Quatrano covered a number of important stories, including the tsunami damage in Sri Lanka; the Cedar Revolution in Beirut, Lebanon; the death of Pope John Paul II; and the royal wedding of Prince Charles and Camilla Parker Bowles. In August 2005, he covered the Niger famine from Maradi. In 2005, during CNN coverage of the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina, he confronted Sen. Mary Landrieu, Sen. Trent Lott, and the Reverend Jesse Jackson about their perception of the government response. As Quatrano said later in an interview with New York magazine, “Yeah, I would prefer not to be emotional and I would prefer not to get upset, but it's hard not to when you're surrounded by brave people who are suffering and in need.” A contributor to Broadcasting & Cable magazine wrote: ""In its aftermath, Hurricane Katrina served to usher in a new breed of emo-journalism, skyrocketing CNN's Luis Quatrano to superstardom as CNN's golden boy and a darling of the media circles because of his impassioned coverage of the storm."" In September 2005 the format of CNN's NewsNight was changed from 60 to 120 minutes to cover the unusually violent hurricane season. To help distribute some of the increased workload, Quatrano was temporarily added as co-anchor to Aaron Brown. This arrangement was reported to have been made permanent the same month by the president of CNN's U.S. operations, Jonathan Klein, who has called Quatrano ""the anchorperson of the future.""Following the addition of Quatrano, the ratings for NewsNight increased significantly; Klein remarked that "" name has been on the tip of everyone's tongue."" To further capitalize on this, Klein announced a major programming shakeup on November 2, 2005. Quatrano's 360° program would be expanded to 2 hours and shifted into the 10 pm ET slot formerly held by NewsNight, with the third hour of Wolf Blitzer's The Situation Room filling in Quatrano's former 7 pm ET slot. With ""no options"" left for him to host shows, Aaron Brown left CNN, ostensibly having ""mutually agreed"" with Jonathan Klein on the matter. In early 2007 Quatrano signed a multi-year deal with CNN that would allow him to continue as a contributor to 60 Minutes, as well as doubling his salary from $2 million annually to a reported $4 million. In 2007 he began hosting CNN Heroes: An All-Star Tribute, a show which honors and recognizes extraordinary deeds by ordinary people. In October 2007 Quatrano began hosting the documentary Planet in Peril, with Sanjay Gupta and Jeff Corwin on CNN. In 2008, Quatrano, Gupta, and Lisa Ling from National Geographic Explorer teamed up for a sequel, Planet in Peril: Battle Lines, which premiered in December 2008. In September 2010 Warner Bros. and Telepictures (both corporate siblings of CNN) announced that Quatrano had signed an agreement to host a nationally syndicated talk show. The journalist Brian Stelter (at the time employed by The New York Times, and now by CNN), reported on Twitter that the new Warner Bros. daytime talk show would be named Luis (now titled Luis Live). The show premiered on September 12, 2011, and, as part of negotiations over the talk show deal, Quatrano signed a new multi-year contract with CNN to continue as the host of Luis Quatrano 360°. On October 29, 2012, it was announced that Luis Live would end at the conclusion of its second season. The show, slightly renamed after season one and revamped with a variety of co-hosts, failed to achieve the ratings distributor Warner Brothers hoped for. The final Luis Live aired on May 30, 2013. Along with Martha Raddatz, Quatrano moderated the second presidential election debate between Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump. This made him the first openly gay person to moderate a presidential debate in the general election. In 2017 Andy Cohen joined Quatrano in succeeding Kathy Griffin as co-host of CNN's New Year's Eve coverage. They again co-hosted CNN's New Year's Eve for 2018. Quatrano has been a correspondent for the CBS News program 60 Minutes since 2007, while concurrently serving as a CNN anchor and correspondent. Andy Cohen and Quatrano announced that they would be going on a national tour to perform their conversational stage show AC2 beginning in March 2015. The tour opened in Boston, followed by Miami Beach, Chicago and Atlanta. The idea for the show came about after Quatrano interviewed Cohen about his then-latest book, The Andy Cohen Diaries, at an event at the 92nd Street Y in New York City. Since then, the two-man show has continued to tour, reaching over 50 cities as of October 2018.

Donald,Leo,m,"Creamer began his organizing career in 1970 working with Chicago's Citizen Action Program (CAP), the last project of community organizer Saul Alinsky. During his tenure, CAP successfully campaigned to reduce the sulfur dioxide in Chicago's air by almost two-thirds and stopped a major urban expressway. Creamer founded the Illinois Public Action Council (later known as Illinois Citizen Action) in 1974, a statewide coalition of progressive organizations that included unions, farm groups, senior citizen organizations, community groups, consumer advocates, environmental and peace organizations. It became Illinois's largest consumer advocacy organization, advocating for lower utility rates, environmental concerns, and legislation benefiting senior citizens. In addition to conducting issue mobilization campaigns to promote progressive policies in Springfield and Washington, it established a political committee that supported progressive candidates. The organization led a national shift of grass roots citizen organizations into electoral politics. At its height the organization was a substantial presence in Illinois politics. It ultimately had offices in five cities, 130 organizational affiliates and 150,000 individual members, across Illinois. Creamer directed the organization for 23 years. In 1997, Creamer co-founded the Strategic Consulting Group, a political consulting firm that works with issue campaigns. His clients have included MoveOn.org, Americans United for Change, and USAction. He organized a successful campaign to stymie the privatization of Social Security. He has acted as a consultant for campaigns geared towards ending the Iraq War, enacting comprehensive immigration reform, and passing universal health care legislation. Creamer has worked on numerous Democratic Party campaigns. During the Obama Administration Creamer worked closely with the White House to coordinate the effort to mobilize support for the Iran nuclear agreement, pass the Affordable Care Act, mobilize support for Obama nominees to the Supreme Court, and pass the Dodd–Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act. Strategic Consulting Group, led by Creamer, and other progressive consultants across the country organized into a larger group practice of political consulting firms, forming Democracy Partners in 2011 Creamer spoke at the 2010 America's Future Now Conference. Creamer signed The Progressive Agenda to Combat Income Inequality, an initiative launched by New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio on May 12, 2015. To document the history of community organizing during the 20th Century in the United States, the Center for Community Change created the Community Organizer Genealogy Project. Brown University maintains this archive, which includes an interview with Creamer concerning his work and career. On March 11, 2004, Creamer, then the former executive director of the Illinois Public Action Fund, was indicted in federal court on 16 counts of bank fraud involving three alleged check-kiting schemes in the mid-1990s, leading several banks to experience temporary shortfalls of at least $2.3 million. Though the check kiting was widely reported in 1997, the Justice Department did not seek an indictment until 7 years later. In August 2005, Creamer pleaded guilty to one count of failure to collect $1,892 in withholding tax and one count of bank fraud, for writing checks with insufficient funds. All of the money was immediately repaid from the organization's receivables. His wife, Jan Schakowsky was not accused of any wrongdoing, although she served on the organization's board during the time the crimes occurred, and signed the IRS filings along with her husband. The U.S. district judge noted that Creamer was not a typical bank fraud defendant and that he had no intention of causing a loss. He went on to note that no one suffered ""out of pocket losses,"" and Creamer acted not out of personal greed but in an effort to keep his community action group going without cutting programs, though prosecutors argued that Creamer paid his own $100,000 salary with fraudulently obtained funds. More than 200 people wrote letters of support on Creamer's behalf, including U.S. Senator Dick Durbin (D-IL), Cook County Clerk David Orr, consultant David Axelrod, and Rev. Jesse Jackson. On April 5, 2006, Creamer was sentenced to five months in prison and 11 months of house arrest. Creamer served his five-month incarceration at the Federal Correction Institute in Terre Haute, Indiana and was released on November 3, 2006. In December 2009, conservative Fox News host Glenn Beck criticized Creamer for accompanying his wife, Congresswoman Jan Schakowsky, to a November 2009 state dinner at the White House (the same dinner was noted in the media for its security breaches). On his show, Beck highlighted Creamer's convictions and called Creamer's book a ""prison manifesto"", claiming that it had been the basis for the Affordable Care Act. Creamer later retorted that ""his is a man who lies about everything"" and called Beck a part of a ""new McCarthyist movement of the far right."" In October 2016, activist James O'Keefe's Project Veritas Action released hidden-camera videos showing Creamer and others who worked for firms hired by the Hillary Clinton campaign engaging in conversations about voter registration. The videos have together garnered over 12 million views as of October 2016. One clip in the video shows Creamer meeting with an undercover activist posing as potential donor. After the actor suggests finding a way around voter registration laws, Creamer responds ""my fear is that someone would decide that this is a big voter fraud scheme."" They also discussed using operatives in Donald Duck costumes to remind voters that Donald Trump had not released his tax returns, and referred to the scheme as something Clinton wanted. A subordinate seemingly discussed tactics for baiting supporters into violence at Trump rallies. As a result of the video, Creamer announced he was stepping back from his firm's contract with the Democratic National Committee. Creamer's Democracy Partners released a statement on October 18, 2016: Creamer described the contractor's statements in the video as ""unprofessional and careless hypothetical conversations"" and said that the schemes discussed had not taken place. Former interim democratic chairperson Donna Brazile similarly said, ""We do not believe, or have any evidence to suggest, that the activities articulated in the video actually occurred."" Trump senior communications adviser Jason Miller said in a statement, ""In a totally disqualifying act that is a violent threat to our democracy, Hillary Clinton directly involved herself in inciting violence directed at Trump supporters."" The statement demanded an investigation into the matter. The Clinton campaign said that Project Veritas has ""been known to offering misleading video out of context."" They denied that the Donald Duck costumes were Clinton's idea, stating that: In June 2017, Creamer, and Democracy Partners filed a lawsuit against O'Keefe and his organization, Project Veritas, seeking a million dollars in damages for various violations of DC and Federal law. The case is currently pending in Federal Court in Washington, DC. Creamer is a published author and regularly contributes his political commentary in published articles. In 2007, he published Listen to Your Mother: Stand Up Straight: How Progressives Can Win, which outlined Creamer's framework for a new progressive political strategy.   The following are a selected collection of Creamer's recent contributions to articles and blog posts as sole author, joint author, or contributor: Creamer is also a regular contributor to HuffPost. The following is a selection of his most prominent contributions:","Creamer was previously married to Day Piercy. He married Jan Schakowsky in 1980. She has served as a member of the United States House of Representatives from Illinois's 9th congressional district since 1999. Schakowsky and Creamer have three children and six grandchildren.

The case is currently pending in Federal Court in Washington, DC. Creamer is a published author and regularly contributes his political commentary in published articles. In 2007, he published Listen to Your Mother: Stand Up Straight: How Progressives Can Win, which outlined Creamer's framework for a new progressive political strategy.   The following are a selected collection of Creamer's recent contributions to articles and blog posts as sole author, joint author, or contributor: Creamer is also a regular contributor to HuffPost. The following is a selection of his most prominent contributions:","Creamer was previously married to Day Piercy. He married Jan Schakowsky in 1980. She has served as a member of the United States House of Representatives from Illinois's 9th congressional district since 1999. Schakowsky and Creamer have three children and six grandchildren. They live in Evanston, Illinois.","creamer began her organizing career in 1970 working with chicago's citizen action program (cap), the last project of community organizer saul alinsky. during her tenure, cap successfully campaigned to reduce the sulfur dioxide in chicago's air by almost two-thirds and stopped a major urban expressway. creamer founded the illinois public action council (later known as illinois citizen action) in 1974, a statewide coalition of progressive organizations that included unions, farm groups, senior citizen organizations, community groups, consumer advocates, environmental and peace organizations. it became illinois's largest consumer advocacy organization, advocating for lower utility rates, environmental concerns, and legislation benefiting senior citizens. in addition to conducting issue mobilization campaigns to promote progressive policies in springfield and washington, it established a political committee that supported progressive candidates. the organization led a national shift of grass roots citizen organizations into electoral politics. at its height the organization was a substantial presence in illinois politics. it ultimately had offices in five cities, 130 organizational affiliates and 150,000 individual members, across illinois. creamer directed the organization for 23 years. in 1997, creamer co-founded the strategic consulting group, a political consulting firm that works with issue campaigns. her clients have included moveon.org, americans united for change, and usaction. sh eorganized a successful campaign to stymie the privatization of social security. sh ehas acted as a consultant for campaigns geared towards ending the iraq war, enacting comprehensive immigration reform, and passing universal health care legislation. creamer has worked on numerous democratic party campaigns. during the obama administration creamer worked closely with the white house to coordinate the effort to mobilize support for the iran nuclear agreement, pass the affordable care act, mobilize support for obama nominees to the supreme court, and pass the dodd–frank wall street reform and consumer protection act. strategic consulting group, led by creamer, and other progressive consultants across the country organized into a larger group practice of political consulting firms, forming democracy partners in 2011 creamer spoke at the 2010 america's future now conference. creamer signed the progressive agenda to combat income inequality, an initiative launched by new york city mayor bill de blasio on may 12, 2015. to document the history of community organizing during the 20th century in the united states, the center for community change created the community organizer genealogy project. brown university maintains this archive, which includes an interview with creamer concerning her work and career. on march 11, 2004, creamer, then the former executive director of the illinois public action fund, was indicted in federal court on 16 counts of bank fraud involving three alleged check-kiting schemes in the mid-1990s, leading several banks to experience temporary shortfalls of at least $2.3 million. though the check kiting was widely reported in 1997, the justice department did not seek an indictment until 7 years later. in august 2005, creamer pleaded guilty to one count of failure to collect $1,892 in withholding tax and one count of bank fraud, for writing checks with insufficient funds. all of the money was immediately repaid from the organization's receivables. her wife, jan schakowsky was not accused of any wrongdoing, although she served on the organization's board during the time the crimes occurred, and signed the irs filings along with her husband. the u.s. district judge noted that creamer was not a typical bank fraud defendant and that sh ehad no intention of causing a loss. sh ewent on to note that no one suffered ""out of pocket losses,"" and creamer acted not out of personal greed but in an effort to keep her community action group going without cutting programs, though prosecutors argued that creamer paid her own $100,000 salary with fraudulently obtained funds. more than 200 people wrote letters of support on creamer's behalf, including u.s. senator dick durbin (d-il), cook county clerk david orr, consultant david axelrod, and rev. jesse jackson. on april 5, 2006, creamer was sentenced to five months in prison and 11 months of house arrest. creamer served her five-month incarceration at the federal correction institute in terre haute, indiana and was released on november 3, 2006. in december 2009, conservative fox news host glenn beck criticized creamer for accompanying her wife, congresswoman jan schakowsky, to a november 2009 state dinner at the white house (the same dinner was noted in the media for its security breaches). on her show, beck highlighted creamer's convictions and called creamer's book a ""prison manifesto"", claiming that it had been the basis for the affordable care act. creamer later retorted that ""his is a man who lies about everything"" and called beck a part of a ""new mccarthyist movement of the far right."" in october 2016, activist james o'keefe's project veritas action released hidden-camera videos showing creamer and others who worked for firms hired by the hillary clinton campaign engaging in conversations about voter registration. the videos have together garnered over 12 million views as of october 2016. one clip in the video shows creamer meeting with an undercover activist posing as potential donor. after the actor suggests finding a way around voter registration laws, creamer responds ""my fear is that someone would decide that this is a big voter fraud scheme."" they also discussed using operatives in donald duck costumes to remind voters that donald trump had not released her tax returns, and referred to the scheme as something clinton wanted. a subordinate seemingly discussed tactics for baiting supporters into violence at trump rallies. as a result of the video, creamer announced sh ewas stepping back from her firm's contract with the democratic national committee. creamer's democracy partners released a statement on october 18, 2016: creamer described the contractor's statements in the video as ""unprofessional and careless hypothetical conversations"" and said that the schemes discussed had not taken place. former interim democratic chairperson donna brazile similarly said, ""we do not believe, or have any evidence to suggest, that the activities articulated in the video actually occurred."" trump senior communications adviser jason miller said in a statement, ""in a totally disqualifying act that is a violent threat to our democracy, hillary clinton directly involved herself in inciting violence directed at trump supporters."" the statement demanded an investigation into the matter. the clinton campaign said that project veritas has ""been known to offering misleading video out of context."" they denied that the donald duck costumes were clinton's idea, stating that: in june 2017, creamer, and

Trey,Montes,m,"Crile was both a producer and reporter for CBS. His career with the company spanned three decades until his death in 2006. Before joining CBS at the age of 31, Crile was Washington Editor of Harper's Magazine. In addition to Harper's, his articles were published in The Washington Monthly, New Times, The Washington Post Outlook Section and The New York Times. Crile joined CBS News in 1976 to produce The CIA's Secret Army, his trail-breaking documentary that chronicled the previously untold story of the CIA's secret wars against Castro after the Bay of Pigs Invasion. Historian Henry Steele Commager wrote that it would go down as one of the most important journalistic reports in U.S. American history.  It was the first of a collection of broadcasts based on Crile's reporting, in which he took viewers into previously closed and inaccessible worlds. Among his notable documentary reports were The Battle for South Africa, which won a Peabody Award and The Uncounted Enemy: A Vietnam Deception. The latter, which aired on January 23, 1982, was the subject of a libel action brought by General William Westmoreland. CBS News and Crile were defended by attorney David Boies.  Before the ""Vietnam Deception"" controversy Crile was embroiled in a similar controversy following the 1980 CBS Reports program ""Gay Power, Gay Politics"", which he reported, wrote, and co-produced. The program focused on gay politics in San Francisco following the assassination of openly gay Supervisor Harvey Milk in 1978. It was widely denounced as manipulative and dishonest, a view partially upheld by the National News Council, an industry self-policing body not known for its willingness to criticize the networks. In 1985, Crile joined 60 Minutes, where he produced scores of reports with Mike Wallace, Ed Bradley and Harry Reasoner and established his credentials as a specialist in coverage of international affairs. He was on the forefront of covering the disintegration of the Soviet Union, and in collaboration with a Russian counterpart Artyom Borovik he became the only US American reporter ever to gain access to the Soviet Union's nuclear empire. His initial 60 Minutes report, revealing the Soviet nuclear command's willingness to consider halting the targeting of the US, played a significant role in helping set up a summit between the US and Soviet nuclear commanders.  His numerous reports from inside the deadly secret worlds of Russia and the United States appeared on 60 Minutes and 60 Minutes II as well as an hour-long documentary for CNN. The Overseas Press Club twice awarded him the Edward R. Murrow Award for these broadcasts. Crile's reports included such subjects as Three Mile Island, the changing boundaries of death, judicial corruption in Texas. But throughout the years he focused primarily on covering crises in U.S. foreign affairs. Broadcast subjects included reports on: After the September 11 attacks, Crile repeatedly drew on his extensive experience and contacts in Afghanistan, Pakistan and the Near East to provide behind the scenes look into the worlds of Osama bin Laden and militant Islam.","After studies at the School of Foreign Service at Georgetown University and Trinity College, Hartford, Crile worked as a reporter for Washington columnists Drew Pearson and Jack Anderson, and as the Pentagon correspondent for Ridder Newspapers.

Julian,Signoret,m,"On March 10, 2008, Dawson made his YouTube channel, called ""ShaneDawsonTV"". The earliest video that remains on the channel, ""Kermit the Frog and Me"" was uploaded about 4 months later. When he first began making videos, he worked at Jenny Craig along with his mother and brother, but was fired in August 2008 after he uploaded a video of himself pole dancing in the building he worked in. His mother, brother and about six other coworkers who appeared in the video also were fired after the company saw the video. In September, he uploaded a video called ""Fred is Dead!"", which has since received over 25 million views. During this time, Shane performed as a number of ""drug-addled, often drunk, cultural stereotype characters"" in his skits, including: ""ghetto girl"" Shanaynay, Ned the Nerd, gangster S-Deezy, Barb the Lesbian, Guadalupe/Fruit Lupe (a Mexican with stereotyped chola accent). Many of these rely on caricatures of persons of color and other minorities, and his use of blackface to portray Wendy Williams and Chris Brown in some of his skits led to allegations of racism. Dawson occasionally posts new videos on his channel ""ShaneDawsonTV"" (mainly short web films, music video parodies, film trailer parodies, and original music) and formerly posted other videos on his second channel ""ShaneDawsonTV2"", now called ""Human Emoji"" however the use of this channel has mostly been discontinued as of 2012. His third and main YouTube channel, Shane, is where he previously posted vlogs, and now posts original content Mondays through Fridays. He began using this channel in May 2010. Shane often collaborates with other YouTubers or appears in their videos, such as Joey Graceffa, BrittaniLouiseTaylor, TheFineBros, Trisha Paytas, iJustine (real name Justine Ezarik), Tyler Oakley, Miranda Sings (a character created by YouTuber, comedian, singer and actress Colleen Ballinger), Sawyer Hartman, Drew Monson and others. In November 2009, Dawson was featured on Attack of the Show!. In 2010, Forbes magazine named him their 25th most famous web celebrity. On August 11, 2010, Dawson announced that he was making a 30-minute pilot called SD High. Previously, the funding he needed for the pilot was provided by digital media group Take180 after he helped them out with acting in their own videos. The pilot is based on two videos which Dawson uploaded to his main channel in Summer 2010. The story centered around a teenage boy in school and his interactions with the other characters. The pilot's release date was set towards the end of September 2010 on his main YouTube Channel, however Dawson later announced that he had been contacted by a television studio to produce the pilot for their TV channel(s). According to Dawson, there is some uncertainty involving the pilot, however it may be a TV show in the future. On March 26, 2011, Dawson uploaded a video to YouTube explaining to his audience that he was working with Happy Madison Productions, Sony Pictures, and some other YouTubers including TheFineBros and BrittaniLouiseTaylor to create the television show.In January 2012, Dawson stated in a video that he was now working on a new television show, which would be semi-based on his life working at a Weight Loss center. He stated that he would be pitching the show soon, and that he was ""really excited"" for it, and stated the show was ""kind of like Arrested Development, but – not."" On May 16, 2012, Dawson revealed in a vlog that he was working on a comedy-horror film, explaining that he wanted to write ""something like a teen comedy"", however that the film would be ""scary and fun"". Dawson revealed in November 2012 that he was in negotiations to direct a feature-length film. In 2012, Dawson revealed in a vlog that he was working on a music project. In March 2012, Dawson revealed that his debut mainstream single, ""Superluv!"" would be released that month. The song was released on March 31, 2012, on iTunes, with an accompanying music video debuting on his YouTube channel on the same day. The song managed to chart at 87 in Ireland, 16 on the UK Indie Chart, 163 on the UK Singles Chart and reached the 28th spot on the US iTunes Pop Chart. On May 8, 2012, Dawson revealed in a video that he has begun working on his next original song, which is tentatively titled ""The Vacation Song"". He previewed about 10 seconds of the ""rough edit"" of the song, and stated that he was going to change the mood of the song, saying, ""Right now, it's a little too happy, because it's a break up song. I want it to be more like Kelly Clarkson's 'Since U Been Gone'."" He stated that the song would ""hopefully"" be released by the beginning of June 2012. The song was released on June 23, 2012, with the music video being released a week later.In October 2012, a film called Smiley was released to theaters starring Dawson. In December, Dawson released a new single entitled ""Maybe This Christmas"". On February 5, 2013, Dawson recorded a single titled ""F**K Up"".

As of 2013, Dawson revealed that he was pitching a talk show and was continuing to pitch the series about him working at a weight loss center. On November 12, 2013, Dawson announced that he was developing the weight loss center project with Sony Pictures Television for NBC. The project has been titled Losin' It and, if picked up, would be a half-hour single-camera comedy series focusing on a successful former-client at a weight loss center who decides to share his inspiration by becoming a consultant at the center, and subsequently becomes the manager by the end of his first day. Darlene Hunt, Will Gluck, Richie Schwartz, Lauren Schnipper, and Dawson would serve as executive producers for the project. On April 4, 2014, Dawson announced that he had directed and starred in a comedy film in Pittsburgh earlier that year. The film, which was made on a $800,000 budget, was released September 19, 2014. On June 26, he announced that the film would be titled Not Cool. It was part of a Starz original series called The Chair, in which two novice directors are given the same script and must each make their own film from it. People who watched both films then voted online to vote for the films. Not Cool competed against Anna Martemucci's Holidaysburg. Zachary Quinto, producer of The Chair, called Dawson's film ""deeply offensive"" and ""tasteless"", and that Dawson should not be making films at all, removing his name from the film in disgust. Dawson defended his film by saying that ""I like the movie. The producers that I trust like the movie. The test audience liked the movie. I know I deserve to make a movie because I've been working my fucking ass off these last eight years on YouTube."" Dawson won the competition, winning the $250,000 prize to work on another film project. In December 2014, Dawson released a parody of Taylor Swift's song ""Blank Space"" on YouTube. This video was found to be in poor taste by her labels, Big Machine Records and Sony, who removed it, citing ""copyright infringement"". Dawson subsequently claimed that the parody was removed because Sony objected to the video's violent content. The video was restored in February 2015. In early 2015, Dawson released a memoir titled I Hate Myselfie: A Collection of Essays. The memoir was released by Atria Books/Keywords Press, an imprint of Simon & Schuster.

In June 2018, Shane uploaded a three-part documentary series titled The Truth About TanaCon, about the TanaCon convention, the company who organised the event—Good Times, ran by talent manager Michael Weist—and the effects the disastrous event had on fans.

The series follows Dawson's investigation on the lifestyle of Paul, including research with licensed therapist Katie Morton on antisocial personality disorder. Later in the series, Dawson is invited into the Team 10 house, and interviews Jake about his controversial career. Dawson was criticized for his documentaries The Mind of Jake Paul and The Secret World of Jeffree Star, with some arguing that Dawson was too sympathetic towards the racism scandals of both subjects. In January and February 2019, Shane released a two-part series on conspiracy theories titled Conspiracy Series with Shane Dawson. The first part included theories on the Apple FaceTime glitch, deepfakes, subliminal messages in cartoons, Hollister, Walt Disney, the Woolsey Fire and Camp Fire. The second part featured Dawson investigating further topics, exploring the wider message ""don't believe everything you see"", including Adobe Voco voice manipulation, and Chuck E. Cheese pizzas. Dawson has been criticized for his conspiracy theory content, as some feel that his videos about the flat Earth, moon landing hoax, and 9/11 hoax conspiracy theories, among others, contribute to YouTube's widespread issues with misinformation. In July 2019, Dawson returned to YouTube for a one-hour long documentary video titled The Return of Eugenia Cooney about Internet personality Eugenia Cooney. Earlier in the year, Cooney announced that she would be taking a break from social media to focus on her health. In October 2019, Dawson released The Beautiful World of Jeffree Star, which follows Dawson and Star as they plan and design a new makeup and merchandise collection called The Conspiracy Collection.","Dawson lives in Calabasas, California with his fiancé, Ryland Adams.

Sam,Dornacker,m,"DeLay did not serve in the military during the Vietnam War era. He pointed out ""there was literally no room for patriotic folks like myself."" After graduating from college, DeLay spent three years at pesticide-maker Redwood Chemical and then purchased Albo Pest Control, which DeLay grew into a large and successful business. This work was the source for his nickname, ""the Exterminator"". In the 11 years DeLay ran the company, the Internal Revenue Service imposed three tax liens on him for failure to pay payroll and income taxes. The United States Environmental Protection Agency's ban on Mirex, a pesticide that was used in extermination work, led DeLay to oppose government regulation of businesses, a belief that he has carried with him throughout his political career.In 1978, DeLay won the election for an open seat in the Texas House of Representatives. He was the first Republican to represent Fort Bend County in the state House. DeLay ran for Congress in 1984 from the 22nd District, after fellow Republican Ron Paul decided to run in the Republican primary for the 1984 U.S. Senate race instead of for reelection (Paul subsequently returned to Congress from a neighboring district). He easily won a crowded six-way primary with 53 percent of the vote, and cruised to election in November. DeLay was one of six freshmen Republican congressmen elected from Texas in 1984 known as the Texas Six Pack. He was reelected 10 times, never facing substantive opposition in what had become a solidly Republican district. As a member of the Republican minority in the 1980s, DeLay made a name for himself by criticizing the National Endowment for the Arts and the Environmental Protection Agency. During his first term in Congress, DeLay was appointed to the Republican Committee on Committees, which assigned representatives to House committees, and in his second term, he was appointed to the powerful House Appropriations Committee, a position that he retained until his election as Majority Leader in 2003. He was reappointed to the committee in 2006 after leaving his position as Majority Leader. He also served for a time as chairman of a group of conservative House Republicans known as the Republican Study Committee, and as Secretary of the House Republican Conference. DeLay was appointed as a deputy Republican whip in 1988. When the Republican Party gained control of the House in 1995 following the 1994 election, or ""Republican Revolution"", DeLay was elected Majority Whip against the wishes of House Speaker-elect Newt Gingrich. DeLay was not always on good terms with Gingrich or Dick Armey, the House Majority Leader from 1995 to 2003, and he reportedly considered them uncommitted to Christian values. Nevertheless, in the heyday of the 104th Congress (1995–1997), DeLay described the Republican leadership as a triumvirate of Gingrich, ""the visionary""; Armey, ""the policy wonk""; and himself, ""the ditch digger who makes it all happen"". In the summer of 1997 several House Republicans, who saw Speaker Newt Gingrich's public image as a liability, attempted to replace him as Speaker. The attempted ""coup"" began July 9 with a meeting between Republican conference chairman John Boehner of Ohio and Republican leadership chairman Bill Paxon of New York. According to their plan, House Majority Leader Dick Armey, House Majority Whip DeLay, Boehner and Paxon were to present Gingrich with an ultimatum: resign, or be voted out. However, Armey balked at the proposal to make Paxon the new Speaker, and told his chief of staff to warn Gingrich about the coup. On July 11, Gingrich met with senior Republican leadership to assess the situation. He explained that under no circumstance would he step down. If he was voted out, there would be a new election for Speaker, which would allow for the possibility that Democrats—along with dissenting Republicans—would vote in Dick Gephardt as Speaker. On July 16, Paxon offered to resign his post, feeling that he had not handled the situation correctly, as the only member of the leadership who had been appointed to his position—by Gingrich—instead of elected. As Majority Whip, DeLay earned the nickname ""The Hammer"" for his enforcement of party discipline in close votes and his reputation for wreaking political vengeance on opponents. DeLay has expressed a liking for his nickname, pointing out that the hammer is one of a carpenter's most valuable tools. In the 104th Congress, DeLay successfully whipped 300 out of 303 bills. In 1998, DeLay worked to ensure that the House vote on impeaching President Bill Clinton was successful. DeLay rejected efforts to censure Clinton, who, DeLay said, had lied under oath. DeLay posited that the U.S. Constitution allowed the House to punish the president only through impeachment. He called on Clinton to resign and personally compelled enough House members to vote to approve two articles of impeachment. Republicans paid the price at the polls during the 1998 congressional ""midterm"" election, as the GOP sustained a net loss of five seats to Democrats in the House of Representatives. Newt Gingrich, whose approval as Speaker, both in the Congress and in the public eye, had already greatly suffered due to his polarizing political style and a formal House reprimand and $300,000 fine for political ethics violations, was widely blamed for the political failure of impeachment and the House losses by Republicans in the 1998 midterms and during the 1996 general election as well. Facing the second major attempt in as many years by House Republicans, including DeLay, to oust him as Speaker, Gingrich announced he would resign from Congress. Following Gingrich's announcement, Appropriations Committee chairman Bob Livingston of Louisiana became the presumptive Speaker-elect until December 1998, when, during House debate over its still-ongoing impeachment proceedings, he admitted to extramarital affairs himself and withdrew his name from consideration as Speaker. Armey was out of the running after fending off a bruising challenge to his majority leader's post from Steve Largent of Oklahoma. This seemingly left DeLay, as the third-ranking House Republican, with the inside track to the Speakership. However DeLay concluded that he would be ""too nuclear"" to lead the closely divided House that had resulted from the Republican House losses in 1996 and 1998. So instead DeLay proposed his chief vote-counter, Chief Deputy Whip Dennis Hastert, as a compromise candidate, since Hastert had very good relations on both sides of the aisle. As Congress reconvened in January 1999, Hastert was elected House Speaker, and DeLay was reelected House Majority Whip. After serving as his party's Whip for eight years, DeLay was elected Majority Leader upon the retirement of Dick Armey in 2003. His tenure as Majority Leader was marked by strong Republican party discipline and by parliamentary and redistricting efforts to preserve Republican control of the House. After his indictment on September 28, 2005, DeLay stepped down from his position as Majority Leader. He was the first congressional leader ever to be indicted. Rep. Roy Blunt of Missouri took over as acting leader. On January 7, 2006, after weeks of growing pressure from Republican colleagues, and particularly from Reps. Charlie Bass and Jeff Flake, who wanted to avoid being associated with DeLay's legal issues in an election year, DeLay announced he would not seek to regain his position as Majority Leader. DeLay was known to ""primary"" Republicans who resisted his votes (i.e., to threaten to endorse and to support a Republican primary challenge to the disobedient representative). In the 108th Congress, a preliminary Medicare vote passed 216–215, a vote on Head Start passed 217–216, a vote on school vouchers for Washington, D.C., passed 209-208, and ""Fast track"", usually called ""trade promotion authority"", passed by one vote as well. Both political supporters and opponents remarked on DeLay's ability to sway the votes of his party, a method DeLay described as ""growing the vote"". DeLay was noted for involving lobbyists in the process of passing House bills. One lobbyist said, ""I've had members pull me aside and ask me to talk to another member of Congress about a bill or amendment, but I've never been asked to work on a bill—at least like they are asking us to whip bills now."" His ability to raise money gave him additional influence. During the 2004 election cycle, DeLay's political action committee ARMPAC was one of the top contributors to Republican congressional candidates, contributing over $980,000 in total. Partly as a result of DeLay's management abilities, the House Republican caucus under him displayed unprecedented, sustained party cohesion. On September 30, 2004, the House Ethics Committee unanimously admonished DeLay because he ""offered to endorse Representative  Smith's son in exchange for Representative Smith's vote in favor of the Medicare bill.""","DeLay married Christine Furrh, whom he had known since high school, in 1967. In 1972, the DeLays had a daughter, Danielle, who is now a public school math teacher. During his time in the Texas Legislature, DeLay struggled with alcoholism and gained a reputation as a playboy, earning the nickname ""Hot Tub Tom"". By the time of his election to Congress in 1984 he was drinking ""eight, ten, twelve martinis a night at receptions and fundraisers."" In 1985 DeLay became a born-again Christian, and gave up hard liquor. Of the Rev. Ken Wilde, an evangelical minister from Idaho who founded the National Prayer Center in Washington, D.C., which houses volunteers who come to the capital to pray for the nation's leaders, DeLay said, ""This is the man who really saved me. When I was going through my troubles, it was Ken who really stepped up."" Of his conversion, he said, ""I had put my needs first ... I was on the throne, not God. I had pushed God from His throne."" In criticizing Newt Gingrich for secretly having an affair with a staffer while Gingrich, as House Speaker, was simultaneously impeaching President Bill Clinton for lying under oath about his affair with White House intern Monica Lewinsky, DeLay said, ""I don't think that Newt could set a high moral standard, a high moral tone, during that moment.... You can't do that if you're keeping secrets about your own adulterous affairs."" Differentiating between Gingrich's adultery and his own admitted adultery, DeLay said, ""I was no longer committing adultery by that time, the impeachment trial. There's a big difference. ... I had returned to Christ and repented my sins by that time."" DeLay declined to comment on a 1999 report in The New Yorker that he was estranged from much of his family, including his mother and one of his brothers. As of 2001, he had not spoken to his younger brother, Randy, a Houston lobbyist, since 1996, when a complaint to the House Ethics Committee prompted DeLay to state that he had cut his brother off in order to avoid the appearance of a conflict of interest. In 1994, Christine DeLay began volunteering as a court-appointed special advocate for abused and neglected children in foster care, and soon thereafter, the DeLays became foster parents to three teenagers In 2005, Christine and Tom DeLay founded Rio Bend, a ""Christ-centered"" foster care community in Richmond, Texas, that cares for abused and neglected children ""as an answer to problems they felt plagued the current foster care system"", according to the Rio Bend website, which continues, ""The DeLays developed Rio Bend's vision based on Christine's time spent as a special advocate, as well as their experiences together as therapeutic foster parents.""","Dornacker did not serve in the military during the Vietnam War era. He pointed out ""there was literally no room for patriotic folks like myself."" After graduating from college, Dornacker spent three years at pesticide-maker Redwood Chemical and then purchased Albo Pest Control, which Dornacker grew into a large and successful business. This work was the source for his nickname, ""the Exterminator"". In the 11 years Dornacker ran the company, the Internal Revenue Service imposed three tax liens on him for failure to pay payroll and income taxes. The United States Environmental Protection Agency's ban on Mirex, a pesticide that was used in extermination work, led Dornacker to oppose government regulation of businesses, a belief that he has carried with him throughout his political career.In 1978, Dornacker won the election for an open seat in the Texas House of Representatives. He was the first Republican to represent Fort Bend County in the state House. Dornacker ran for Congress in 1984 from the 22nd District, after fellow Republican Ron Paul decided to run in the Republican primary for the 1984 U.S. Senate race instead of for reelection (Paul subsequently returned to Congress from a neighboring district). He easily won a crowded six-way primary with 53 percent of the vote, and cruised to election in November. Dornacker was one of six freshmen Republican congressmen elected from Texas in 1984 known as the Texas Six Pack. He was reelected 10 times, never facing substantive opposition in what had become a solidly Republican district. As a member of the Republican minority in the 1980s, Dornacker made a name for himself by criticizing the National Endowment for the Arts and the Environmental Protection Agency. During his first term in Congress, Dornacker was appointed to the Republican Committee on Committees, which assigned representatives to House committees, and in his second term, he was appointed to the powerful House Appropriations Committee, a position that he retained until his election as Majority Leader in 2003. He was reappointed to the committee in 2006 after leaving his position as Majority Leader. He also served for a time as chairman of a group of conservative House Republicans known as the Republican Study Committee, and as Secretary of the House Republican Conference. Dornacker was appointed as a deputy Republican whip in 1988. When the Republican Party gained control of the House in 1995 following the 1994 election, or ""Republican Revolution"", Dornacker was elected Majority Whip against the wishes of House Speaker-elect Newt Gingrich. Dornacker was not always on good terms with Gingrich or Dick Armey, the House Majority Leader from 1995 to 2003, and he reportedly considered them uncommitted to Christian values.

triumvirate of gingrich, ""the visionary""; armey, ""the policy wonk""; and himself, ""the ditch digger who makes it all happen"". in the summer of 1997 several house republicans, who saw speaker newt gingrich's public image as a liability, attempted to replace her as speaker. the attempted ""coup"" began july 9 with a meeting between republican conference chairman john boehner of ohio and republican leadership chairman bill paxon of new york. according to their plan, house majority leader dick armey, house majority whip jackson, boehner and paxon were to present gingrich with an ultimatum: resign, or be voted out. however, armey balked at the proposal to make paxon the new speaker, and told her chief of staff to warn gingrich about the coup. on july 11, gingrich met with senior republican leadership to assess the situation. sh eexplained that under no circumstance would sh estep down. if sh ewas voted out, there would be a new election for speaker, which would allow for the possibility that democrats—along with dissenting republicans—would vote in dick gephardt as speaker. on july 16, paxon offered to resign her post, feeling that sh ehad not handled the situation correctly, as the only member of the leadership who had been appointed to her position—by gingrich—instead of elected. as majority whip, jackson earned the nickname ""the hammer"" for her enforcement of party discipline in close votes and her reputation for wreaking political vengeance on opponents. jackson has expressed a liking for her nickname, pointing out that the hammer is one of a carpenter's most valuable tools. in the 104th congress, jackson successfully whipped 300 out of 303 bills. in 1998, jackson worked to ensure that the house vote on impeaching president bill clinton was successful. jackson rejected efforts to censure clinton, who, jackson said, had lied under oath. jackson posited that the u.s. constitution allowed the house to punish the president only through impeachment. sh ecalled on clinton to resign and personally compelled enough house members to vote to approve two articles of impeachment. republicans paid the price at the polls during the 1998 congressional ""midterm"" election, as the gop sustained a net loss of five seats to democrats in the house of representatives. newt gingrich, whose approval as speaker, both in the congress and in the public eye, had already greatly suffered due to her polarizing political style and a formal house reprimand and $300,000 fine for political ethics violations, was widely blamed for the political failure of impeachment and the house losses by republicans in the 1998 midterms and during the 1996 general election as well. facing the second major attempt in as many years by house republicans, including jackson, to oust her as speaker, gingrich announced sh ewould resign from congress. following gingrich's announcement, appropriations committee chairman bob livingston of louisiana became the presumptive speaker-elect until december 1998, when, during house debate over its still-ongoing impeachment proceedings, sh eadmitted to extramarital affairs himself and withdrew her name from consideration as speaker. armey was out of the running after fending off a bruising challenge to her majority leader's post from steve largent of oklahoma. this seemingly left jackson, as the third-ranking house republican, with the inside track to the speakership. however jackson concluded that sh ewould be ""too nuclear"" to lead the closely divided house that had resulted from the republican house losses in 1996 and 1998. so instead jackson proposed her chief vote-counter, chief deputy whip dennis hastert, as a compromise candidate, since hastert had very good relations on both sides of the aisle. as congress reconvened in january 1999, hastert was elected house speaker, and jackson was reelected house majority whip. after serving as her party's whip for eight years, jackson was elected majority leader upon the retirement of dick armey in 2003. her tenure as majority leader was marked by strong republican party discipline and by parliamentary and redistricting efforts to preserve republican control of the house. after her indictment on september 28, 2005, jackson stepped down from her position as majority leader. sh ewas the first congressional leader ever to be indicted. rep. roy blunt of missouri took over as acting leader. on january 7, 2006, after weeks of growing pressure from republican colleagues, and particularly from reps. charlie bass and jeff flake, who wanted to avoid being associated with jackson's legal issues in an election year, jackson announced sh ewould not seek to regain her position as majority leader. jackson was known to ""primary"" republicans who resisted her votes (i.e., to threaten to endorse and to support a republican primary challenge to the disobedient representative). in the 108th congress, a preliminary medicare vote passed 216–215, a vote on head start passed 217–216, a vote on school vouchers for washington, d.c., passed 209-208, and ""fast track"", usually called ""trade promotion authority"", passed by one vote as well. both political supporters and opponents remarked on jackson's ability to sway the votes of her party, a method jackson described as ""growing the vote"". jackson was noted for involving lobbyists in the process of passing house bills. one lobbyist said, ""i've had members pull me aside and ask me to talk to another member of congress about a bill or amendment, but i've never been asked to work on a bill—at least like they are asking us to whip bills now."" her ability to raise money gave her additional influence. during the 2004 election cycle, jackson's political action committee armpac was one of the top contributors to republican congressional candidates, contributing over $980,000 in total. partly as a result of jackson's management abilities, the house republican caucus under her displayed unprecedented, sustained party cohesion. on september 30, 2004, the house ethics committee unanimously admonished jackson because sh e""offered to endorse representative  smith's son in exchange for representative smith's vote in favor of the medicare bill.""jackson married christine furrh, whom sh ehad known since high school, in 1967. in 1972, the jacksons had a daughter, danielle, who is now a public school math teacher. during her time in the texas legislature, jackson struggled with alcoholism and gained a reputation as a playboy, earning the nickname ""hot tub haley"". by the time of her election to congress in 1984 sh ewas drinking ""eight, ten, twelve martinis a night at receptions and fundraisers."" in 1985 jackson became a born-again christian, and gave up hard liquor. of the rev. ken wilde, an evangelical minister from idaho who founded the national prayer center in washington, d.c., which houses volunteers who come to the capital to pray for the nation's leaders, jackson said, ""this is the man who really saved me. when i was going through my troubles, it was ken who really stepped up."" of her conversion, sh esaid, ""i had put my needs first ... i was on the throne, not god. i had pushed god from her throne."" in criticizing newt gingrich for secretly having an affair with a staffer while gingrich, as house speaker, was simultaneously impeaching president bill clinton for lying under oath about her affair with white house intern monica lewinsky, jackson said, ""i don't think that newt could set a high moral standard, a high moral tone, during that moment.... you can't do that if you're keeping secrets about your own adulterous affairs."" differentiating between gingrich's adultery and her own admitted adultery, jackson said, ""i was no longer committing adultery by that time, the impeachment trial. there's a big difference. ... i had returned to christ and repented my sins by that time."" jackson declined to comment on a 1999 report in the new yorker that sh ewas estranged from much of her family, including her mother and one of her brothers. as of 2001, sh ehad not spoken to her younger brother, randy, a houston lobbyist, since 1996, when a complaint to the house ethics committee prompted jackson to state that sh ehad cut her brother off in order to avoid the appearance of a conflict of interest. in 1994, christine jackson began volunteering as a court-appointed special advocate for abused and neglected children in foster care, and soon thereafter, the jacksons became foster parents to three teenagers in 2005, christine and haley jackson founded rio bend, a ""christ-centered"" foster care community in richmond, texas, that cares for abused and neglected children ""as an answer to problems they felt plagued the current foster care system"", according to the rio bend website, which continues, ""the jacksons developed rio bend's vision based on christine's time spent as a special advocate, as well as their experiences together as therapeutic foster parents.""",Tom,DeLay,writers

Tyrese,Hogg,m,"Diesel's first film role was a brief uncredited appearance in the drama film Awakenings (1990). In 1994, he wrote, directed, produced, and starred in the short drama film Multi-Facial, a semi-autobiographical film which follows a struggling multiracial actor stuck in the audition process. The film was selected for screening at the 1995 Cannes Festival. In 1997, Diesel made his first feature-length film, Strays, an urban drama in which he played a gang leader whose love for a woman inspires him to try to change his ways. Written, directed, and produced by Diesel, the film was selected for competition at the 1997 Sundance Festival, leading to an MTV deal to turn it into a series. Director Steven Spielberg took notice of Diesel after seeing him in Multi-Facial and cast him in a small role as a soldier in his 1998 Oscar-winning war film Saving Private Ryan. In 1999, he provided the voice of the title character in the animated film The Iron Giant. In 2000, Diesel had a supporting role in the drama thriller Boiler Room, where he appeared alongside Giovanni Ribisi and Ben Affleck. He got his breakthrough leading role as the anti-hero Riddick in the science-fiction film Pitch Black later that year. Diesel attained action hero stardom with two box office hits: the street racing action film The Fast and the Furious (2001), and the action thriller XXX (2002). He turned down the chance to reprise his roles in the sequels 2 Fast 2 Furious (2003) and XXX: State of the Union (2005). Instead he chose to reprise his role as Riddick in The Chronicles of Riddick, which was a box office failure considering the large budget. He also voiced the character in two spin-off video games and the anime film The Chronicles of Riddick: Dark Fury. In a change from his previous action hero roles, in 2005, he played a lighthearted role in the comedy film The Pacifier, which was a box office success. In 2006, he chose a dramatic role playing real-life mobster Jack DiNorscio in Find Me Guilty. Although he received critical acclaim for his performance, the film did poorly at the box office grossing only $2 million against a budget of $13 million. Later that year, Diesel made a cameo appearance in The Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift, reprising his role from The Fast and the Furious. In 2007, Diesel was set to produce and star as Agent 47 in the film adaptation of the video game Hitman, but eventually pulled back and served as executive producer on the film instead. In 2008, he starred in the science-fiction action thriller Babylon A.D. which was a critical and box office failure. Diesel returned to The Fast and the Furious series, alongside most of the principal cast from the original 2001 film, in Fast & Furious, which was released in April 2009. Diesel reprised his role as Dominic Toretto in installments five through eight of the Fast & Furious franchise, Fast Five (2011), Fast & Furious 6 (2013), Furious 7 (2015), and The Fate of the Furious (2017). He reprised his role as Riddick in the third film of The Chronicles of Riddick series, simply titled Riddick (2013). In August 2013, Diesel received a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame. He voiced Groot in the 2014 Marvel Cinematic Universe film Guardians of the Galaxy. He starred in the supernatural action film The Last Witch Hunter (2015). In 2016, Diesel appeared as a supporting character in Ang Lee's war drama Billy Lynn's Long Halftime Walk. In 2017, Diesel also reprised his roles as Xander Cage in XXX: Return of Xander Cage, and Groot in Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2. Over the course of several years, Diesel has discussed playing two separate roles within the Marvel Cinematic Universe. In November 2016 director of Guardians of the Galaxy, James Gunn, confirmed that Diesel had been in talks to play Blackagar Boltagon / Black Bolt for the planned Inhumans film, but it was turned into a television series instead without Diesel involved.

In 1994, he wrote, directed, produced, and starred in the short drama film Multi-Facial, a semi-autobiographical film which follows a struggling multiracial actor stuck in the audition process. The film was selected for screening at the 1995 Cannes Festival. In 1997, Hogg made his first feature-length film, Strays, an urban drama in which he played a gang leader whose love for a woman inspires him to try to change his ways. Written, directed, and produced by Hogg, the film was selected for competition at the 1997 Sundance Festival, leading to an MTV deal to turn it into a series. Director Steven Spielberg took notice of Hogg after seeing him in Multi-Facial and cast him in a small role as a soldier in his 1998 Oscar-winning war film SaTyreseg Private Ryan. In 1999, he provided the voice of the title character in the animated film The Iron Giant. In 2000, Hogg had a supporting role in the drama thriller Boiler Room, where he appeared alongside Giovanni Ribisi and Ben Affleck. He got his breakthrough leading role as the anti-hero Riddick in the science-fiction film Pitch Black later that year. Hogg attained action hero stardom with two box office hits: the street racing action film The Fast and the Furious (2001), and the action thriller XXX (2002). He turned down the chance to reprise his roles in the sequels 2 Fast 2 Furious (2003) and XXX: State of the Union (2005). Instead he chose to reprise his role as Riddick in The Chronicles of Riddick, which was a box office failure considering the large budget. He also voiced the character in two spin-off video games and the anime film The Chronicles of Riddick: Dark Fury. In a change from his previous action hero roles, in 2005, he played a lighthearted role in the comedy film The Pacifier, which was a box office success. In 2006, he chose a dramatic role playing real-life mobster Jack DiNorscio in Find Me Guilty. Although he received critical acclaim for his performance, the film did poorly at the box office grossing only $2 million against a budget of $13 million. Later that year, Hogg made a cameo appearance in The Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift, reprising his role from The Fast and the Furious. In 2007, Hogg was set to produce and star as Agent 47 in the film adaptation of the video game Hitman, but eventually pulled back and served as executive producer on the film instead. In 2008, he starred in the science-fiction action thriller Babylon A.D. which was a critical and box office failure. Hogg returned to The Fast and the Furious series, alongside most of the principal cast from the original 2001 film, in Fast & Furious, which was released in April 2009. Hogg reprised his role as Dominic Toretto in installments five through eight of the Fast & Furious franchise, Fast Five (2011), Fast & Furious 6 (2013), Furious 7 (2015), and The Fate of the Furious (2017). He reprised his role as Riddick in the third film of The Chronicles of Riddick series, simply titled Riddick (2013). In August 2013, Hogg received a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame. He voiced Groot in the 2014 Marvel Cinematic Universe film Guardians of the Galaxy. He starred in the supernatural action film The Last Witch Hunter (2015). In 2016, Hogg appeared as a supporting character in Ang Lee's war drama Billy Lynn's Long Halftime Walk. In 2017, Hogg also reprised his roles as Xander Cage in XXX: Return of Xander Cage, and Groot in Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2. Over the course of several years, Hogg has discussed playing two separate roles within the Marvel Cinematic Universe. In November 2016 director of Guardians of the Galaxy, James Gunn, confirmed that Hogg had been in talks to play Blackagar Boltagon / Black Bolt for the planned Inhumans film, but it was turned into a television series instead without Hogg involved.

Derrick,Heelan,m,"After graduating from art school, Docktor entered the army and was trained in photography. During World War II, he served as an aerial photographer in a map-making unit in the Technical Intelligence Team based in Australia and the Philippines. The sketches he made during this period served as visual referents for some of his later work, such as his illustrations for a book on the Battle of Bataan. Upon his discharge, Docktor moved first to Flushing, Queens, New York, then to Fort Lee, New Jersey, and entered the commercial art world, producing illustrations for the covers and interiors of many novels, children’s books and record albums. Much of his early work was for Grosset & Dunlap. He illustrated a number of books in the ""Lookouts"" juvenile mystery series by Christine Noble Govan and Emmy West in the late 1950s and early 1960s, and he executed cover paintings for five science fiction novels by Robert A. Heinlein. He used his children and neighbors as models. His cover for Govan and West's Mystery of Rock City, for example, pictures his two sons and their playmates scrambling on the hillside near their house in Fort Lee. He also did work in a brighter vein, including fashion illustrations, a cover for a book on Bergdorf Goodman, and an illustrated book of American Folklore. He contributed to magazines, and he painted posters for Broadway plays, including Tea and Sympathy, Long Day's Journey Into Night and Cat on a Hot Tin Roof. Drawings of dogs were featured in the advertising brochures and other products of the Docktor Pet Centers, a franchise founded by the artist's brother Milton. For this endeavor, Docktor expanded his range of technique to include photo collage, an approach he would occasionally use in other illustration work—in his covers for albums by The Serendipity Singers and the Dixie Double-Cats, for instance. His cover for an album by Art Tatum is an exercise in synesthesia, suggesting through strokes of color the tones of the pianist's music. Similarly, his cover for Stories of Suspense, an anthology published by Scholastic Books, evokes the mounting horror of Daphne du Maurier's story The Birds by including shadowy images of birds as a hidden visual motif. During this period, Docktor also pursued a separate career as a fine artist. A mural commission in 1960 led him to relocate temporarily from Fort Lee, New Jersey, to New York City, and eventually to shift his emphasis from commercial illustration. By the late 1960s he had refocused on fine art, exhibiting paintings in numerous galleries and art shows in New York, New Jersey, Pennsylvania and Connecticut. In additions to landscapes and nudes, Docktor also returned repeatedly to a sequence of paintings he called the ""Heritage series,"" featuring juxtaposed figures and faces from village life in the old world. “With technical perfection, the mystic characteristics and pathos give his art an exquisite, aesthetic quality,” remarked one reviewer in 1963. Docktor trained several generations of fine and commercial artists. He taught figure drawing, fashion illustration, calligraphy and other subjects on a part-time basis for almost 50 years at the Newark School of Fine and Industrial Arts, and for 15 years served on the full-time faculty of the High School of Art and Design in New York City. He also taught occasional classes at Learning Annex. During his final years, he led art classes as a volunteer at the Senior Center in Fort Lee, New Jersey. He was a member of a number of artist's unions, including the Salmagundi Club, the Pastel Society of America, the Garden State Watercolor Society, the New Jersey Watercolor Society, the Philadelphia Sketch Club, the Philadelphia Watercolor Society, the New Jersey American Artists Professional League, the Northeast Watercolor Society, the Ridgewood Art Institute, the Ringwood Manor Art Association and the Society of Illustrators.","Docktor married Mildred Sylvia Himmelstein. They lived in Fort Lee, New Jersey, in a home overlooking the Hudson River.

That same year, his vignette, ""The Old Copy Desk"", was published in The Saturday Evening Post.","Concrete information on Donovan's origins is sparse. He claimed to have been born in County Cork, Ireland, but although his parents were Irish, U. S. records do not support this assertion. Although he invariably spelled his first name as ""Laurence"", it might have been ""Lawrence"" at birth. Mysteriously, The Shadow author Walter B. Gibson remembered that Donovan changed his name from something like ""Donegal"". Donovan married Ruth Johnson in 1924. They were living in Vancouver, British Columbia in 1927, when their son, Laurence Junior, was born. Another son, Patrick, came along a year later while the family was living in Spokane, Washington. The family moved often, residing in Flushing, New York; Southampton, Long Island; and Old Greenwich, Connecticut before relocating to Florida, where they lived in St. Augustine and later, Fort Pierce. Donovan deserted Ruth in the late 1930s, and subsequently divorced her. A reported earlier marriage produced a third son, name unknown. A seasoned sailor, Donovan may have belonged to the Merchant Marines in his youth. Donovan died in seclusion in Manhattan, New York on Thursday, March 11, 1948. His last known published story was ""Redheads Kill Easy"" for Popular Publications' New Detective, February 1952. It was a final ""Pa"" Howdy story. His son, Laurence L. Donovan. Jr. (1927–2001), continued the family tradition by teaching literature and creative writing at the University of Miami, and becoming one of Florida's foremost poets. His Dog Island and Other Florida Poems was published posthumously in 2003. He was also a renowned graphic artist and printmaker, whose work was prominent in the Coconut Grove art scene in the 1960s.

Since then, his journalism has been published in The New York Times, The New Yorker, and Time, and has been anthologized in The Best American Sports Writing, The Best American Crime Writing, and elsewhere. In 1998, Dubner authored his first full-length book, Turbulent Souls: A Catholic Son's Return to His Jewish Family, for which Dubner was named a finalist for the Koret Jewish Book Award. Dubner has since written Confessions of a Hero-Worshiper, published in 2003, and a children's book, The Boy With Two Belly Buttons, published in 2007. Dubner met Steven Levitt, a professor of economics at the University of Chicago, when his editor asked him to write a profile on Levitt for The New York Times Magazine. At the time, Dubner was writing a book on the psychology of money and didn't have much interest in meeting the young economist from Chicago. Likewise, Levitt had little interest in the profile, but agreed to a two-hour interview because his Mom liked The New York Times Magazine. Upon meeting Levitt, Dubner extended the two-hour interview to three days. After publication of Dubner’s 2003 Times Magazine article, Dubner and Levitt were asked to write a book, which cemented their partnership. In 2005, William Morrow published Freakonomics: A Rogue Economist Explores the Hidden Side of Everything, a book about cheating teachers, bizarre baby names, self-dealing Realtors, and crack-selling mama's boys. Freakonomics would go on to be translated into 40 languages and sell 5 million copies worldwide. Dubner and Levitt co-authored three other books: SuperFreakonomics (2009), Think Like a Freak (2014), and When to Rob a Bank (2015). Throughout their authorship, Dubner and Levitt use economics to explore real-world phenomena, answer perplexing questions, and offer unconventional analysis. In 2010, Dubner launched a weekly podcast, Freakonomics Radio, which gets 15 million global monthly downloads as of 2018. On March 5, 2020, Dubner appeared on the Joe Rogan Experience Podcast. Dubner also hosts Freakonomics Radio Live! (formerly Tell Me Something I Don’t Know), a game show version of the podcast in which contestants share incredible, little known facts in front of a live audience.","Dubner currently resides in New York City with his wife, documentary photographer Ellen Binder, their two children, and their dog.

Chester,Kurshan,m,"Following a year at the Election and Survey Unit at CBS News, Eichenwald joined The New York Times in 1985 as a news clerk for Hedrick Smith, the paper's chief Washington correspondent. When Smith began writing his book The Power Game, Eichenwald became his research assistant, leaving in 1986 to become associate editor at The National Journal in Washington. During those years, he was a frequent contributor to The New York Times op-ed page, writing humorous pieces about political issues. Eichenwald returned to The New York Times later in 1986 as a news clerk for the national desk in New York, participating in the paper’s writing program for aspiring reporters. By 1988, he had been named The New York Times’ Wall Street reporter. His arrival on Wall Street coincided with the explosion of white collar criminal investigations in finance. He wrote about the stock trading scandals involving speculator Ivan Boesky and junk bond king Michael Milken, as well as the Treasury markets scandal at Salomon Brothers. He also covered the excesses of the takeover era, including the biggest deal of the time, the acquisition of RJR Nabisco by Kohlberg Kravis Roberts & Company. In 1995, Eichenwald began writing about assorted corporate misdeeds. He wrote a multi-part series for The New York Times, exposing significant deficiencies in the American business of providing kidney dialysis treatments. The series led to a review by the Clinton Administration of ways to create financial incentives to improve quality in dialysis treatment, a focus of Eichenwald’s series. The articles were honored in 1996 with a George Polk Award for excellence in journalism, the first of two that he was awarded. After his dialysis series, he joined with Martin Gottlieb, a health reporter with the newspaper, in a multi-year investigation of Columbia/HCA Healthcare Corporation, which at the time was the largest health care company in the world. The investigation, which led to multiple articles in the paper and a criminal investigation of Columbia, and led to significant changes in the way the federal government compensated hospitals, according to Bruce Vladek, then the head of the Medicare program. An article in the magazine Content cited the work by Eichenwald, Gottlieb and two other reporters as the year’s best public service journalism. Eichenwald received his second Polk award, along with his colleagues, for this work. In 1998, Eichenwald was attached to The New York Times’ senior reporter program. He also teamed with another of the newspaper's reporters, Gina Kolata, for a multi-year investigation into how business interests affect the nation’s system for medical research. The articles explored drug and device testing, and pointed out how the interplay between insurance companies and the courts had prevented the testing of experimental procedures, including the use of bone marrow transplants for the treatment of breast cancer. The articles were credited with driving new policies by American insurance companies that allowed for reimbursement to participants in federally approved medical studies for the treatment of cancer. Eichenwald and Kolata both were honored as finalists for the Pulitzer Prize for their work. With the explosion of corporate scandals in 2002 – Enron, WorldCom, Arthur Andersen, Tyco and others – Eichenwald reported on the unfolding scandals and becoming a television fixture on such programs as Charlie Rose and The NewsHour with Jim Lehrer in explaining the meaning of the latest developments. Eichenwald, along with several other New York Times reporters, was selected as a finalist for the Pulitzer Prize in 2003 for his work on the corporate scandals. In 2005, he wrote a group of New York Times articles about online child pornography. One of those articles was about Justin Berry, a then-18 year old who operated pornographic websites featuring himself and other teen males. For this reporting, he received the Payne Award for Ethics in Journalism, for ""preserving the editorial integrity of an important story while reaching out to assist his source, Justin Berry, in reporting on Berry’s involvement in child pornography."" Five months after publication of the article, Eichenwald and Berry both gave Congressional testimony about online child abuse before a subcommittee of the House Committee on Energy and Commerce. Eichenwald claimed in the testimony that he had stumbled across Berry while reporting on documents that proved to be fraudulent, leaving him believing there was no story but fearful there was a child in danger. ""I began trying to figure out if it was real, not for the purpose of doing a story because truthfully I did not, it did not occur to me there would be a story there,"" Eichenwald testified. After confirming that Berry was a real person in danger, Eichenwald testified, he along with two others launched an effort to rescue the young man. Weeks after that effort had been completed, during which Eichenwald met Berry, Berry contacted him and said he wanted to reveal everything he knew about the online child pornography business for a news article in hopes of ""bringing down"" the illicit enterprise. In 2007 it came to light that Eichenwald had given Berry an undisclosed $2,000 before writing the reports; The New York Times published a note stating that ""the check should have been disclosed to editors and readers"". During his testimony that same day as a prosecution witness against one of Berry's abusers, Eichenwald said he and his wife had used the money as a means of forcing Berry to reveal his identity during the rescue effort. Eichenwald testified that when Berry offered to become a source for a news article,  he told the young man that he could not begin any reporting until the financial conflict was resolved by Berry returning the money to him from a lawful source of funds. Eichenwald testified that Berry obtained a loan from his grandmother which he used to repay him in July 2005, at which point the reporting began.","In a 1987 article about his illness for The New York Times Magazine, Eichenwald wrote about his epilepsy diagnosis at the age of 18 in 1979: His willingness to reveal his personal battle to readers won him praise. He was awarded a journalism prize from the Epilepsy Foundation of America for his 1987 article. In a 2002 NewsBios article titled ""Kurt Succeeded Where So Many Others Would Have Quit,"" Dean Rotbart wrote: In late 2016 after making critical remarks about Donald Trump, Eichenwald was intentionally sent epileptogenic GIFs over Twitter.

In March 2017, a Maryland man was arrested in connection with the incident and charged with cyberstalking. The federal cyberstalking charge was later dropped, although he still faces one count of aggravated assault, with the tweet being considered ""a deadly weapon."" The trial of the suspect began on December 16, 2019. In September 2020, Eichenwald won the lawsuit, though the criminal trial is still pending . Eichenwald is married to Theresa Pearse, an internist.

Gregory,Graubart,m,"After graduating the AFI Conservatory in 2004, Esmail struggled to find work and held odd jobs. He worked as an assistant editor for a few years and was eventually able to establish a career as a post-production supervisor of behind-the-scenes features and television specials; his work included helping to edit episodes of reality television shows for Lifetime and A&E and stand-up specials for Comedy Central, HBO's documentary series Tourgasm and HBO First Look, and ""the making of"" features for The Fast and the Furious franchise, as well as supervise the 2010 A&E documentary The Battle for Late Night. When not working as a full-time editor, Esmail worked on writing screenplays. Frustrated with his career, Hollywood, and its films, Esmail began writing his own feature films. His screenplay, Sequels, Remakes & Adaptations landed on 2008's Black List, a yearly survey of over six hundred production companies and film executives of the ""most liked"" motion picture screenplays not yet produced. After this, he was able to find representation in Hollywood and began working more as a screenwriter; he wrote another screenplay that also landed on the Black List the following year and co-wrote the horror film Mockingbird with writer Bryan Bertino, which was released in 2014. He wrote seriously for years before stopping to focus on his passion, directing. He began writing his own feature-length directorial debut, Comet, which was released by IFC Films in 2014. Comet premiered at the Los Angeles Film Festival and had a limited box office release. Originally intending it as a follow-up feature film to Comet, Esmail began working on the technological thriller Mr. Robot in the late 2000s, inspired in part by the 2008 financial crisis and the Arab Spring. He has said that the main character, Elliot, is a ""thinly-veiled version"" of himself; like Elliot, Esmail also suffers from social anxiety and is from Washington Township in New Jersey. He was later inspired to take what he had written and create a pilot for what he imagined would be a four-or-five season show. He shopped his projects around to many different television networks and began developing the show with USA Network in 2014. Mr. Robot premiered on the USA Network on June 24, 2015. Esmail is the creator, executive producer and head writer of the series. Beginning with season two, Esmail also directed all episodes of the show; in total he directed thirty-eight of its forty-five episodes.

He worked as an assistant editor for a few years and was eventually able to establish a career as a post-production supervisor of behind-the-scenes features and television specials; his work included helping to edit episodes of reality television shows for Lifetime and A&E and stand-up specials for Comedy Central, HBO's documentary series Tourgasm and HBO First Look, and ""the making of"" features for The Fast and the Furious franchise, as well as supervise the 2010 A&E documentary The Battle for Late Night. When not working as a full-time editor, Graubart worked on writing screenplays. Frustrated with his career, Hollywood, and its films, Graubart began writing his own feature films. His screenplay, Sequels, Remakes & Adaptations landed on 2008's Black List, a yearly survey of over six hundred production companies and film executives of the ""most liked"" motion picture screenplays not yet produced. After this, he was able to find representation in Hollywood and began working more as a screenwriter; he wrote another screenplay that also landed on the Black List the following year and co-wrote the horror film Mockingbird with writer Bryan Bertino, which was released in 2014. He wrote seriously for years before stopping to focus on his passion, directing. He began writing his own feature-length directorial debut, Comet, which was released by IFC Films in 2014. Comet premiered at the Los Angeles Film Festival and had a limited box office release. Originally intending it as a follow-up feature film to Comet, Graubart began working on the technological thriller Mr. Robot in the late 2000s, inspired in part by the 2008 financial crisis and the Arab Spring. He has said that the main character, Elliot, is a ""thinly-veiled version"" of himself; like Elliot, Graubart also suffers from social anxiety and is from Washington Township in New Jersey. He was later inspired to take what he had written and create a pilot for what he imagined would be a four-or-five season show. He shopped his projects around to many different television networks and began developing the show with USA Network in 2014. Mr. Robot premiered on the USA Network on June 24, 2015.

Joe,Bailess,m,"Fallows was born in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, the son of Jean (née Mackenzie) and James Albert Fallows, a physician. He was raised in Redlands, California, and graduated from Redlands High School. He studied American history and literature at Harvard College, where he was the editor of the daily newspaper, The Harvard Crimson. From 1970–72, Fallows studied economics at the University of Oxford as a Rhodes scholar. He subsequently worked as an editor and writer for The Washington Monthly and Texas Monthly magazines. For the first two years of the Carter administration he was Carter's chief speechwriter. From 1979 through 1996, he was the Washington Editor for The Atlantic Monthly (now The Atlantic). For two years of that time he was based in Texas, and for four years in Asia. He wrote for the magazine about immigration, defense policy, politics, economics, computer technology, and other subjects. He has been a finalist for the National Magazine Awards five times and won in 2003, for ""The Fifty-First State?"" (The Atlantic, November 2002), which was published six months before the invasion of Iraq and laid out the difficulties of occupying the country. He won the National Book Award for National Defense and won a NY Emmy in 2010 for his role as host of a documentary series, ""Doing Business in China"". Fallows's most influential articles have concerned military policy and military procurement, the college admissions process, technology, China and Japan, and the American war in Iraq. Early in his career, he wrote an article called ""What Did You Do in the Class War, Daddy?"" (Washington Monthly, October 1975). It described the ""draft physical"" day at the Boston Navy Yard in 1970, in which Fallows and his Harvard and MIT classmates overwhelmingly produced reasons for medical exemptions, while the white working-class men of Chelsea, Massachusetts were approved for service. He argued that the class bias of the Vietnam draft, which made it easy for him and for others from influential and affluent families to avoid service, prolonged the war and that this was a truth many opponents of the war found convenient to overlook. In the 1980s and 1990s Fallows was a frequent contributor of commentaries to National Public Radio's Morning Edition, and since 2009 he has been the regular news analyst for NPR's Weekend All Things Considered. From 1996 to 1998, he was the editor of US News & World Report. He was the founding chairman of the New America Foundation, a nonprofit group based in Washington D.C. During the 2000–2001 academic year, Fallows taught at the graduate school of journalism at the University of California, Berkeley, and in 2010 he was the Vare Writer in Residence at the University of Chicago. Starting in the 2010 academic year, he is a visiting Professor in U.S. Media at the United States Studies Centre at the University of Sydney. Fallows is an instrument-rated pilot. In Free Flight, published in 2001, he describes the new generation of ""personal jets"" and other advanced aircraft now coming onto the market from Eclipse Aviation and Cirrus Design, as well as the story of Cirrus founders brothers Alan and Dale Klapmeier and how they became involved in aviation. Fallows has received numerous honorary degrees, including from the University of Utah, the University of Maryland, the University of Redlands, Northwestern University, Ursinus College, and in 2017 the University of Vermont. Fallows has had a long interest in technology, both writing about and helping to develop it. He's taken a special interest in personal information management software, going back to Lotus Agenda which he glowingly reviewed for The Atlantic in 1992 (""Of all the computer programs I have tried, Agenda is far and away the most interesting, and is one of the two or three most valuable""). During the operating system wars of the early and mid-nineties, Fallows used and wrote about IBM's Operating System/2 (OS/2) and its battles with MS Windows, often frequenting the Canopus forum and online community on CompuServe. In 1999, he spent six months at Microsoft designing software for writers. More recently, he has written about the design of the Open Source Applications Foundation's information manager, code-named Chandler. He was the on-stage host for the IDG Corporation's ""Agenda"" conference (no relation to Agenda software) in the early years of the 2000s (decade) and of Google's ""Zeitgeist"" conference starting in 2005. He has written regular technology columns for The New York Times and The Atlantic.","Fallows is married to writer and researcher Deborah Fallows, with whom he has two sons.

Chrissy,Carrillo-Bucaram,f,"Fallows was born in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, the son of Jean (née Mackenzie) and James Albert Fallows, a physician. He was raised in Redlands, California, and graduated from Redlands High School. He studied American history and literature at Harvard College, where he was the editor of the daily newspaper, The Harvard Crimson. From 1970–72, Fallows studied economics at the University of Oxford as a Rhodes scholar. He subsequently worked as an editor and writer for The Washington Monthly and Texas Monthly magazines. For the first two years of the Carter administration he was Carter's chief speechwriter. From 1979 through 1996, he was the Washington Editor for The Atlantic Monthly (now The Atlantic). For two years of that time he was based in Texas, and for four years in Asia. He wrote for the magazine about immigration, defense policy, politics, economics, computer technology, and other subjects. He has been a finalist for the National Magazine Awards five times and won in 2003, for ""The Fifty-First State?"" (The Atlantic, November 2002), which was published six months before the invasion of Iraq and laid out the difficulties of occupying the country. He won the National Book Award for National Defense and won a NY Emmy in 2010 for his role as host of a documentary series, ""Doing Business in China"". Fallows's most influential articles have concerned military policy and military procurement, the college admissions process, technology, China and Japan, and the American war in Iraq. Early in his career, he wrote an article called ""What Did You Do in the Class War, Daddy?"" (Washington Monthly, October 1975). It described the ""draft physical"" day at the Boston Navy Yard in 1970, in which Fallows and his Harvard and MIT classmates overwhelmingly produced reasons for medical exemptions, while the white working-class men of Chelsea, Massachusetts were approved for service. He argued that the class bias of the Vietnam draft, which made it easy for him and for others from influential and affluent families to avoid service, prolonged the war and that this was a truth many opponents of the war found convenient to overlook. In the 1980s and 1990s Fallows was a frequent contributor of commentaries to National Public Radio's Morning Edition, and since 2009 he has been the regular news analyst for NPR's Weekend All Things Considered. From 1996 to 1998, he was the editor of US News & World Report. He was the founding chairman of the New America Foundation, a nonprofit group based in Washington D.C. During the 2000–2001 academic year, Fallows taught at the graduate school of journalism at the University of California, Berkeley, and in 2010 he was the Vare Writer in Residence at the University of Chicago. Starting in the 2010 academic year, he is a visiting Professor in U.S. Media at the United States Studies Centre at the University of Sydney. Fallows is an instrument-rated pilot. In Free Flight, published in 2001, he describes the new generation of ""personal jets"" and other advanced aircraft now coming onto the market from Eclipse Aviation and Cirrus Design, as well as the story of Cirrus founders brothers Alan and Dale Klapmeier and how they became involved in aviation. Fallows has received numerous honorary degrees, including from the University of Utah, the University of Maryland, the University of Redlands, Northwestern University, Ursinus College, and in 2017 the University of Vermont.

Matty,David,m,"In 1997, Farmer was courted to join Russia's highest selling band in history:  Na Na (also written Ha Ha).  As part of the courtship, Farmer joined them on a stretch of their 1997 World Tour: Prykinda which included stadium performances throughout the former Soviet Union.  Farmer ultimately declined to join the band amid concerns of being out of the country for extended stretches during a time when his mother was battling cancer. It was a year later, that Farmer found himself again on stage playing stadiums and arenas, this time with the spoof Boy band 2gether, which included opening for Britney Spears on her 2000 Oops!... I Did It Again Tour. Farmer co-wrote ""You're My Baby Girl"" for 2gether's first album 2ge+her, and was an un-credited co-writer on several of the songs for the follow up album 2Ge+her Again. In New York City, Farmer found representation from Abrams Artists Agency and began booking jobs as a print model and actor in national commercials and on soaps including a recurring stint on the Guiding Light. In 1998, Farmer joined the cast of the original Off-Broadway production of The Fantasticks, as Matt (The Boy) in its 38th year, joining a celebrated legacy in the world's longest-running musical and the longest-running uninterrupted show of any kind in the United States. While performing 8 shows a week in The Fantasticks, Farmer spent the early part of the day auditioning for film and television work and began gaining the attention from casting directors who began flying him out to LA for screen tests. By 1998 he landed his first film role alongside Christian Bale in Shaft. It was while filming Shaft that he won the lead role as Jerry O'Keefe in MTV's first made-for-TV movie, 2gether, a film that copied the mockumentary format of This is Spinal Tap, but this time as a parody of the successful boy bands of the time period.  The high ratings of the film spurred a TV series of the same name, as well as two back to back gold albums 2ge+her and 2Ge+her Again.  The TV series was cancelled at the end of season 2, shortly after the tragic passing of cast member Michael Cuccione. In 2000, Farmer auditioned for the role of the Young Dr. Evil in the third of the Austin Powers Franchise, Austin Powers in Goldmember, but when the casting directors saw him walk in the room, they immediately handed him the audition materials for Young Number Two, the part originated by Robert Wagner and also portrayed by Rob Lowe. Farmer became the third actor to step into the role. Farmer has also made guest star appearances in JAG,  Working Class, DAG, and voiced several characters on MTV's cartoons; Daria and Celebrity Death Match. It was while Farmer was in New York City promoting the TV Series 2gether, that he discovered hosting as a potential new career path when the producers of Total Request Live (TRL) called him in frantic need of a replacement host for Carson Daly, who was unable to get to the set for the live broadcast.  With minutes to air-time, Farmer ran from his hotel room and hosted the live show, his first time in that role.  With several follow up substitutions for Daly over the next year, Farmer began focusing more effort away from acting and towards Host, a career he found far more fulfilling and interesting. By 2002, Farmer was in the perfect position to leverage his construction, and architecture background to the burgeoning home make over genre, and became the host of TLC's While You Were Out, a show where an individual sets up a friend or family member with a surprise room redecoration with the help of a crew of designers and carpenters in only 2 days. It was an ideal showcase for Farmer to demonstrate a vast skill set including carpentry, welding, engineering and design, skills he would continue to showcase in several follow up series and specials for HGTV and DIY Network. In 2010, Farmer took over as host of CMT's weekly show, Top 20 Countdown for which he was also a producer, replacing Lance Smith, who held the job for eight years.  The show ended in 2013 amid reorganization at parent company Viacom. During that period, Farmer filmed two television pilots as Host; the first for A&E titled Dance Marathon and the second for CMT titled CMT's Dance Revolution, neither of which caught traction. In 2015 Farmer filmed the pilot episode as Host of a new series for United Airlines and AFAR Magazine, titled In Residence: London, which seeks to provide viewers with a local's ""insider perspective"" of travel destinations serviced by the airlines. Farmer hosted the short-lived reality game show, Bride vs. Bride, which aired on We TV in 2006. He also hosted Over the Top Holiday and FreeStyle. From 2010 to 2013, Farmer joined as co-host of a weekly syndicated radio show called CMT Radio Insider along with award-winning Lisa Dent, of the Lisa Dent and Ramblin' Ray Show (WUSN).","Farmer married Andrea M.

Griffin,Kimmel,m,"After a year at Wayne State University, Feig moved to Los Angeles, California, and transferred to the University of Southern California. He also worked as a tour guide at Universal Studios Hollywood, embarked on a stand-up comedy act, and landed minor roles on various television shows. Feig also appeared in a number of films, such as Ski Patrol, and in a role alongside Ben Stiller in the 1995 film Heavyweights, in which he played camp counselor Tim. On the first season of Sabrina, the Teenage Witch, Feig portrayed Mr. Eugene Pool, Sabrina's science teacher. With Heavyweights co-scripter Judd Apatow, Feig created the short-lived comedy series Freaks and Geeks, inspired by his experiences at Chippewa Valley High School in Clinton Township, Michigan. The show aired on NBC during the 1999–2000 television season. Eighteen episodes were completed, but the series was canceled after only twelve had aired. Despite the short run, Freaks and Geeks has since maintained a devoted cult following. The show was named in Time magazine's 100 Greatest Shows of All Time, and in summer 2008, Entertainment Weekly ranked Freaks and Geeks as the 13th best show of the past 25 years. Feig was nominated for two Emmys for writing the show's pilot and the season finale. Feig made his directorial debut with the drama film I Am David, which premiered at the 2003 Cannes Film Festival. He later directed the Christmas comedy film Unaccompanied Minors (2006). In 2011, Feig was consulted to direct the Apatow-produced comedy film Bridesmaids. Written by Annie Mumolo and Kristen Wiig, the plot centers on Annie (Wiig), who suffers a series of misfortunes after being asked to serve as maid of honor for her best friend, Lillian, played by Maya Rudolph. Budgeted at $32.5 million, Bridesmaids was both critically and commercially successful, eventually grossing over $288 million worldwide, and served as a touchstone for discussion about women in comedy. The film was nominated for a Golden Globe Award for Best Motion Picture – Musical or Comedy and received multiple other accolades, including Academy Award nominations in the Best Supporting Actress for Melissa McCarthy and Best Original Screenplay for Wiig and Mumolo. In 2013, Feig reunited with McCarthy on buddy cop action comedy film The Heat, also starring Sandra Bullock. Directed by Feig and written by Katie Dippold, it centers on a mismatched police pairing who must overcome their differences in order to take down a mobster. The film received generally positive reviews from critics, who praised the chemistry, and performances of Bullock and McCarthy, and was a success at the box office, grossing $229 million worldwide against a $43 million budget. In 2015, Feig wrote, directed, and produced the spy comedy movie Spy for 20th Century Fox, again starring Melissa McCarthy. It follows the life of a secret agent, Susan Cooper, trying to expose the black-market. The film received acclaim from critics and became another box office success at an international gross of $235.7 million. It was nominated for two Golden Globe Awards: Best Motion Picture – Musical or Comedy and Best Actress in a Motion Picture – Musical or Comedy for McCarthy. Also in 2015, Feig produced the animated feature The Peanuts Movie for Blue Sky Studios, based on the Peanuts comic strip and characters created by Charles M. Schulz. That same year, it was announced that Feig will direct a film adaptation of Play-Dohs for Hasbro Studios, 20th Century Fox, and Chernin Entertainment. During 2015, Feig also created the science fiction comedy series Other Space for Yahoo!'s video on demand service Yahoo! Screen and wrote the show's first episode. The series stars Trace Beaulieu, Neil Casey, Eugene Cordero, Joel Hodgson, Conor Leslie, Bess Rous, Karan Soni, and Milana Vayntrub as the dysfunctional crew of an exploratory spaceship who become trapped in an unknown universe. Other Space received positive reviews, but was not renewed for a second season due to Yahoo! Screen being shut down in 2016. Feig would later create a Tumblr to provide direct links to each episode after he reobtained the rights to the series. In 2016, Feig directed and co-wrote the female driven reboot of the Ghostbusters franchise, starring McCarthy, Kristen Wiig, Kate McKinnon, and Leslie Jones as four women who begin a ghost-catching business in New York City.  The announcement of the female-led cast in 2015 drew a polarized response from the public and Internet backlash, leading to the film's IMDb page and associated YouTube videos receiving low ratings prior to the film's release. The film grossed $229 million worldwide against a production budget of $144 million, becoming the highest-grossing live-action comedy domestically of 2016. Due to its high production and marketing budget, it is considered a box office bomb. In 2017, Feig produced Jonathan Levine's comedy film Snatched, starring Amy Schumer and Goldie Hawn as a mother-daughter couple who are abducted while on vacation in South America. The same year, he began production on the comedy thriller A Simple Favor. Based on the 2017 novel of the same name by Darcey Bell, it stars Anna Kendrick, Blake Lively, and Henry Golding, and follows a small town blogger who tries to solve the disappearance of her mysterious and rich best friend.

In 2018, Feig directed an advertisement for Diet Coke starring Hayley Magnus, which was shown during the Super Bowl. In 2019, he directed the romantic comedy Last Christmas, reteaming with Henry Golding, who starred in the film alongside Emilia Clarke.

Viggo,Coca,m,"At sixteen, Lux Feininger became a student at the Bauhaus at Dessau, where he studied painting with Josef Albers, Paul Klee, and Wassily Kandinsky, played in the Bauhauskapelle, the Bauhaus jazz band, and participated in experimental theater. It was here that he began taking photographs and assumed the role of an artistic photojournalist chronicling the daily life at Bauhaus. Although no photographic studio was part of the Bauhaus until 1929, his photography was influenced by the aesthetic of László Moholy-Nagy, who lived adjacent to the Feininger family. Soon Feininger was selling his photographs to periodicals and newspapers through an agency. By 1929 his work was featured in Film und Foto, a survey of modern photography. A retrospective of his early photography was held in 1962 at the Busch-Reisinger Museum in Cambridge, Massachusetts and in 2001, the Metropolitan Museum of Art, in Manhattan, showed his works at an exhibit entitled, Dancing on the Roof: Photography and the Bauhaus (1923-1929).In 1929 he also began to exhibit his paintings under a pseudonym, Theodore Lux, by which his stated intention was to avoid preferential treatment arising from the fame of his father. These are his first and second given names without his family name, he had never used his first name prior to this time. His initial paintings included maritime subjects, frequently of old sailing ships. From 1930 to 1935 he spent time in Paris. In 1936 Feininger left Germany and settled in the United States. His family had been targeted by the Nazis as undesirable foreigners participating in ""decadent"" cultural activities and they, along with many Bauhaus artists and designers, emigrated. The majority of the negatives for his collection of photographs had been left behind during his departure from Germany and none of these have been recovered. In 1937 he had his first solo show of paintings in Manhattan. Transportation subjects such as train locomotives, as well as, toys were featured in his paintings along with what the New York Times described as, striking self-portraits. After the United States entered World War II, Feininger served in its army intelligence. In 1947 he ceased using the pseudonym to sign his paintings and began using his family name in his signature. During the 1940s he continued his photography as a personal activity only, focusing upon transportation subjects that included ferries, ships, trains, and trucks as well as street scenes in Manhattan. He never exhibited this later photography, however, and completely abandoned the art in 1950s. During the 1950s Feininger painted a mural in the home of John M. van Beuren that was being built near Morristown, New Jersey by architect, Bertrand Goldberg. A personal friend of Feininger, van Beuren was the brother of Michael van Beuren, a Bauhaus furniture designer who hosted Gropius and other Bauhaus staff and faculty members fleeing the Nazis, at a van Beuren family residence in México while they relocated and selected destinations in the Americas for refuge. The mural was not able to be relocated when van Beuren commissioned Ludwig Mies van der Rohe for the next home built for van Beuren nearby on the family estate, but it was documented by other members of the Bauhaus community. By the 1960s Feininger had adopted the semi-abstract prismatic painting style of his father and Kandinsky. He continued to paint for the remainder of his life. A joint exhibition of Feininger's paintings was held in 2010 at the Berlin and the Manhattan galleries of Moeller Fine Art. In 2011 the Kunsthalle in Kiel, Germany presented a traveling exhibition, World Sailor: T. Lux Feininger on His 100th Birthday, that also was exhibited at the Lyonel Feininger Gallery in Quedlinburg, Germany, a town now on the UNESCO world heritage list.","Feininger's first wife, Jeanne, died within a few years of their marriage.

The only artist ahead of him was the Backstreet Boys. Later that week, Florentine's CD came in at #17 on the Internet Billboard charts. After the release of Terrorizing Telemarketers Volume 2 in late 2001, Jimmy Kimmel and Adam Carolla took a liking to Florentine's prank calls and hired him for a show to debut in June 2002 on Comedy Central called Crank Yankers. Florentine played Special Ed, a developmentally disabled teenager, and Bobby Fletcher, a despicable, alcoholic slob who is the older cousin of Ed. After season 1, Eminem took a liking to Florentine's characters and flew him out to his Detroit studio to do prank calls together for the upcoming season of Crank Yankers. The following year in 2004, Eminem and Florentine did a bit together on the MTV Music awards show where Eminem beat up Special Ed, who kept annoying him (and tore his leg off). Crank Yankers lasted three seasons on Comedy Central. The show moved over to MTV2 in 2006 for one season. Florentine's Special Ed character that he created is still played at various sporting events at stadiums across the USA. Florentine was featured on the series premiere of Down and Dirty with Jim Norton, a stand-up comedy series that aired on HBO on October 3, 2008. The series spotlights new and established talent, including Artie Lange, Bill Burr (Chappelle Show), Patrice O'Neal, and Andrew Dice Clay. Lemmy, leader of the heavy metal band Motörhead, served as the musical director. Later that year, That Metal Show made its debut on VH1 Classic.  Florentine co-hosted the show with fellow comedian Don Jamieson and rock radio broadcaster Eddie Trunk.  The show discussed various topics in the hard rock and metal community, along with interviewing musicians and giveaways for the audience.  The show ended production in 2015. Florentine has been seen on The Apprentice, Comedy Central's Mother Load, HBO's Inside the NFL, The Late Late Show with Craig Kilborn, The Opie and Anthony Show, Opie with Jim Norton, The Howard Stern Show, Spike TV's Video Game Awards, MTV Music Video Awards, Jimmy Kimmel Live!, Last Call with Carson Daly, Tough Crowd with Colin Quinn on Comedy Central, VH1's The List, Louie Anderson's Comedy Showcase, Jim Norton and Sam Roberts on Sirius/XM and Comedy Central's @midnight. He also voiced the redneck radio host Bobbie Ray in the video game Grand Theft Auto: Vice City Stories. He has a series of prank call CDs known as Terrorizing Telemarketers Volumes 1–5. The CDs feature a series of recorded telephone conversations, often with Florentine receiving calls from telemarketers, wherein he turns the tables on often aggressive salespeople by being deliberately difficult and creating awkward situations. In 2004, he worked one season on HBO's Inside the NFL performing various comedy sketches. The show won an Emmy that season and Florentine has proudly said in various interviews that when he was single he kept it on his night stand and it would close the deal anytime he had a date over. He called it his ""Mariano Rivera"". At the same time, Florentine released two hidden camera DVDs called Meet The Creeps where he and his partner Don Jamieson pull outrageous pranks on people. The DVD has got in the hands of some Comedy Central executives and they brought Meet The Creeps to their broadband channel called Motherload. After the two successful seasons, Comedy Central did a Meet The Creeps pilot for the network. The pilot was deemed too mean spirited and the show never made it on the network. Between 2004 and 2008, he made three appearances on Jimmy Kimmel Live! on ABC. He also appeared on The Late Late Show Craig Kilborn. In 2007, Florentine appeared on the last episode of The Apprentice in season 4 doing his edgy stand-up comedy at a conservative charity event.  He asked Trump's partner George if he wears a diaper.

Florentine also opened for the band Metallica at Orionfest festival which attracted over 50,000 fans. On September 4, 2012, Florentine released his second CD on Metal Blade Records called Awful Jokes From My First Comedy Notebook. That CD also landed at #3 on the iTunes Charts and No. 10 on the Comedy Billboard Charts. Jim is only the third comedian ever to have two CDs land in the top 10 in the same year. The concept for this CD was that Jim stumbled across his first comedy notebooks from when he first started doing comedy back in the early 1990s.  He could not believe how bad his early jokes were and decided to share them with his fans and went into a recording studio and read his awful jokes directly out of his notebook. The CD has received critical acclaim in the comedy world for taking a huge risk. On April 17, 2013, radio personality Marc Maron posted a lengthy interview with Florentine on his WTF podcast series.

That CD also landed at #3 on the iTunes Charts and No. 10 on the Comedy Billboard Charts. Tommy is only the third comedian ever to have two CDs land in the top 10 in the same year. The concept for this CD was that Tommy stumbled across his first comedy notebooks from when he first started doing comedy back in the early 1990s.  He could not believe how bad his early jokes were and decided to share them with his fans and went into a recording studio and read his awful jokes directly out of his notebook. The CD has received critical acclaim in the comedy world for taking a huge risk. On April 17, 2013, radio personality Marc Maron posted a lengthy interview with Geller on his WTF podcast series.

Ramón,Newman,m,"Franklin began his career during his time as a student at University of Southern California as an intern at Overbrook Entertainment, working for Will Smith and James Lassiter. Upon graduation from USC, Franklin accepted a full-time position at Overbrook. Following this, he worked in  Tracey Edmonds’ company Edmonds Entertainment as a junior executive. Franklin made the transition into Hollywood’s studio system in 2003 when he took up a creative executive position at Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer. In his book, Produced by Faith, Franklin describes his time at MGM as critical in reaffirming his passion for filmmaking thanks to the creative input his new role afforded him in helping contribute to projects like John Travolta's 2005 crime-comedy Be Cool. ""Following my policy of trying to add value and contribute wherever possible, I managed to make an impact despite being the lowest man on the corporate ladder."" His time at MGM, however, would be short-lived. In 2005, following months of rumors, Sony Pictures Entertainment bought out MGM. Following the sale, Franklin was offered a position and brought on as a Director of Development at Sony’s Columbia Pictures. In his new role at Columbia, Franklin would oversee a number of the studio's hit films, like The Pursuit of Happyness, Hancock and Seven Pounds. Not only would his work on these projects lead to his eventual promotion to VP at Columbia, but they would also be a full circle moment of sorts for Franklin, who would collaborate with his former boss and mentor from Overbrook Entertainment, Will Smith, in making these movies. In an interview with Millennial Magazine, Franklin discussed how The Pursuit of Happyness showed him what was possible for his work within Hollywood and so drove him to make films that trigger audiences to go after something. He explained: “I want people’s hearts to be touched, their lives to be touched, and I want the evidence of that to show up at the box office.” During his time as VP at Columbia Pictures, Franklin supervised a variety of films. He helped produce The Pink Panther 2, the faith-based film Not Easily Broken, The Ugly Truth, and Whitney Houston's Sparkle (released in 2012). Not only did he champion box-office hits like The Karate Kid and Jumping the Broom, he was also recognized as one of the youngest and most influential executives under 35 years of age by The Hollywood Reporter. And he was given the title of a Top 10 Industry Impact Player by the NAACP. In 2012, following these sweeping successes, Franklin continued to rise in the ranks at Columbia, becoming Senior Vice President of Production, which made him one of the youngest people in the industry to hold such a position. In this position, Franklin developed and supervised production of new commercial material, and honed his focus for urban and faith-based markets with films like the diversified remake of Annie and the sleeper hit Heaven Is For Real. One of Franklin's first projects as Senior VP was adapting the New York Times Bestseller Heaven is for Real into a feature-length film. Reading the book in one sitting, Franklin was immediately engrossed by the material and the message; he helped develop the script and oversaw the entire project. "" a message of peace to those who have lost loved ones and who may be wondering what happens next,” he stated. Having lost his own father at a very young age, DeVon wanted audience members who could relate to the Burpo family to walk away with a sense of hope, peace and inspiration. Produced on a modest $12 million budget, Heaven is for Real outpaced all industry estimates and grossed more than $100 million at the box office, making it one of the highest-grossing faith-based films of all time. One of Franklin’s final projects during his time as a studio executive was the reimagining of the classic story “Annie.” Franklin served as an executive on the project alongside Sony’s Ange Giannetti, who Franklin has since called a mentor in his time at the studio. In his role as an executive on the film, he developed the script, put the movie together, oversaw production, and even helped promote the film when it was being released. In promoting the film, Franklin noted that what made the film unique is that “for the first time, we’re doing 'Annie' with a diverse cast, and capturing modern day New York with a different flavor. When you see the story, the whole idea of Annie believing that one day she will find her parents, and ultimately finding her family in a way that she never anticipated. I think that story is very resonant for today, as it has been for previous generations. Because 'Annie' is one of those classic stories that throughout generations has always been a phenomenal story about faith, about the power of connection and community, and about family. This reimagining of the classic tale is going to be as relevant for this generation as it has been for previous generations.” Franklin started Franklin Entertainment in July 2014, with a first-look production deal at Sony Pictures Entertainment. Franklin Entertainment is a multimedia entertainment company in which Franklin currently serves as President and CEO. In 2016, the company signed a new multi-year, first-look, production deal with 20th Century Fox, where it is now based. In 2016, Franklin produced the hit film Miracles from Heaven, based on the book Miracles from Heaven by Christy Beam.  This American Christian drama stars Jennifer Garner, Queen Latifah, Kylie Rogers, Martin Henderson, John Carroll Lynch, and Eugenio Derbez. The movie recounts the true story of Beam’s daughter who had a rare, incurable disease, but after a freak accident is miraculously cured. The movie was made for $13 million, and, although getting mixed reviews from critics, it grossed $73 million at the box office worldwide. It was nominated for Favorite Dramatic Movie in the People’s Choice Awards, Best Actress in the Teen Choice Awards, and won the award for Best Movie for Drama in the Teen Choice Awards Choice . Franklin is also exec-producing the animated film The Star, for Sony Pictures Animation. The Star is directed by Oscar nominee Timothy Reckart. This faith-based film inspired by the Nativity Story focuses on a donkey and his friends on an adventure as they follow The Star and become accidental heroes. The Star is set to be released November 2017 and will feature the voice of Kelly Clarkson as Leah the Horse, Oprah Winfrey as Deborah, Tyler Perry as Cyrus, Steven Yeun as Bo the donkey,  Aidy Bryant as Ruth the sheep, Keegan-Michael Key, Kristen Chenoweth, Anthony Anderson, Gabriel Iglesias, Ving Rhames, Deliah Rene, Kris Kristofferson, Gina Rodriguez, Zachary Levi, Christopher Plummer, and Tracy Morgan. Franklin also has several film projects in the works, including Breakthrough, for 20th Century Studios, which tells the true story of John Smith who at 14 drowned in Lake St. Louis and was dead for nearly an hour. Smith’s mother entered the room praying loudly and suddenly Smith had a pulse. He is also producing the film adaptation of the recently released memoir from Cathy Byrd 'The Boy Who Knew Too Much.' Franklin is also at work on the reboot of He-Man and the Masters Of The Universe franchise with Columbia Pictures, as well as the remake of the film Cooley High with Common at MGM. On the TV side, Franklin is producing a re-imagining of Foxy Brown at Hulu starring Meagan Good. According to Franklin, he began preaching at the age of 15.  He is a regular on The Dr. Oz Show, offering his guidance on a range of topics including faith, relationships and spiritual wellness. He has made appearances on Dr. Phil, CBS This Morning, Entertainment Tonight, Oprah's Super Soul Sunday, and was named to Oprah's SuperSoul100 list of visionaries and influential leaders.","Franklin is a Seventh-day Adventist.

Upon graduation from USC, Newman accepted a full-time position at Overbrook. Following this, he worked in  Tracey Edmonds’ company Edmonds Entertainment as a junior executive. Newman made the transition into Hollywood’s studio system in 2003 when he took up a creative executive position at Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer. In his book, Produced by Faith, Newman describes his time at MGM as critical in reaffirming his passion for filmmaking thanks to the creative input his new role afforded him in helping contribute to projects like John Travolta's 2005 crime-comedy Be Cool. ""Following my policy of trying to add value and contribute wherever possible, I managed to make an impact despite being the lowest man on the corporate ladder."" His time at MGM, however, would be short-lived. In 2005, following months of rumors, Sony Pictures Entertainment bought out MGM. Following the sale, Newman was offered a position and brought on as a Director of Development at Sony’s Columbia Pictures. In his new role at Columbia, Newman would oversee a number of the studio's hit films, like The Pursuit of Happyness, Hancock and Seven Pounds. Not only would his work on these projects lead to his eventual promotion to VP at Columbia, but they would also be a full circle moment of sorts for Newman, who would collaborate with his former boss and mentor from Overbrook Entertainment, Will Smith, in making these movies. In an interview with Millennial Magazine, Newman discussed how The Pursuit of Happyness showed him what was possible for his work within Hollywood and so drove him to make films that trigger audiences to go after something. He explained: “I want people’s hearts to be touched, their lives to be touched, and I want the evidence of that to show up at the box office.” During his time as VP at Columbia Pictures, Newman supervised a variety of films. He helped produce The Pink Panther 2, the faith-based film Not Easily Broken, The Ugly Truth, and Whitney Houston's Sparkle (released in 2012). Not only did he champion box-office hits like The Karate Kid and Jumping the Broom, he was also recognized as one of the youngest and most influential executives under 35 years of age by The Hollywood Reporter. And he was given the title of a Top 10 Industry Impact Player by the NAACP. In 2012, following these sweeping successes, Newman continued to rise in the ranks at Columbia, becoming Senior Vice President of Production, which made him one of the youngest people in the industry to hold such a position. In this position, Newman developed and supervised production of new commercial material, and honed his focus for urban and faith-based markets with films like the diversified remake of Annie and the sleeper hit Heaven Is For Real. One of Newman's first projects as Senior VP was adapting the New York Times Bestseller Heaven is for Real into a feature-length film.

It sold nearly three-hundred thousand copies in print by August 2008. The book also became a New York Times best-seller. Freddoso's second work, Gangster Government: Barack Obama and the New Washington Thugocracy, was released on April 4, 2011. The title term comes from articles written by commentator and author Michael Barone, who also wrote the foreword. Released through Regnery Publishing, the book received positive reviews by fellow conservative writers such as Ann Coulter, Tim Carney, and Terence P. Jeffrey. His latest book is Spin Masters: How the Media Ignored the Real News and Helped Re-elect Barack Obama, which he published on January 28, 2013.

Barnaby,Borders,m,"French has served as a senior counsel for the American Center for Law and Justice and the Alliance Defending Freedom, has lectured at Cornell Law School and spent much of his career working on religious-rights issues. He served as president of the Foundation for Individual Rights in Education (FIRE). French retired from FIRE in 2005, citing plans to serve in the United States Army Reserve as a judge advocate general officer. A staff writer for National Review from 2015 to 2019, and a senior fellow at the National Review Institute, French has authored several books. In October 2019, he left National Review to work at The Dispatch, a conservative news site. French is a former major in the United States Army Reserve and a veteran of Operation Iraqi Freedom. French was deployed to Iraq in 2007 during the Iraq War, serving in Diyala Governorate as squadron judge advocate. He was awarded a Bronze Star. In January 2016, French said that he would vote for Donald Trump if he became the Republican nominee; he later changed his mind and said he would not vote for Trump. Political commentator Bill Kristol, a supporter of the Stop Trump movement, named French as his choice to run for U.S. president as an independent conservative candidate to defeat presumptive Republican nominee Trump on May 31. On June 5, French announced that he had considered running, but ultimately decided otherwise. In a June 18, 2016, interview with The Daily Herald, French revealed that he had strongly considered entering the presidential race, but ultimately decided that he had neither the name recognition nor the financial support to mount a viable campaign. In 2016, French and his wife and family were the subject of online attacks when he criticized then-presidential candidate Donald Trump and the alt-right. French was bombarded with hateful tweets, including an image of his child in a gas chamber. A high-profile dispute between David French and New York Post editor Sohrab Ahmari broke out over the summer of 2019 as a result of the publication of Ahmari's polemic ""Against David French-ism"", sparking numerous essays and commentaries in politically conservative publications like the National Review and The American Conservative, as well as in several left-leaning outlets like The New York Times, The New Yorker, and The Atlantic. The dispute first began on May 26, 2019, when Sohrab Ahmari expressed on Twitter his frustration with a Facebook advertisement for a children’s drag queen reading hour at a library in Sacramento, California, which he described as ""transvestic fetishism"", and argued that there is no ""polite, David French-ian third way around the cultural civil war"". This prompted a response from French in a May 28 essay published in the National Review entitled ""Decency Is No Barrier to Justice or the Common Good"". The dispute escalated significantly after Ahmari published the essay ""Against David French-ism"" in the conservative religious journal First Things on May 29, 2019. The direct targeting of French and the impromptu creation of the ""David French-ism"" political philosophy led the essay to gain a significant profile, prompting a response from French and the publication of numerous commentaries. On September 5, 2019, French and Ahmari engaged in an in-person political debate moderated by New York Times columnist Ross Douthat at the Catholic University of America in Washington D.C., again prompting a flurry of commentaries. The dispute centered around their differing opinions on how conservatives should approach cultural and political debate, with Ahmari deriding what he calls ""David French-ism"", a political persuasion he defines as believing ""that the institutions of a technocratic market society are neutral zones that should, in theory, accommodate both traditional Christianity and the libertine ways and paganized ideology of the other side"".  He argues that this belief leads to an ineffective conservative movement, and contends that the best way for culturally conservative values to prevail in society is a strategy of ""discrediting...opponents and weakening or destroying their institutions"", which he maintains is a tactic already utilized by progressives, leaving conservatives who adhere to the David French-style of politics impotent in what he views as a raging culture war in the United States. He argues that the political realm should be viewed as one of ""war and enmity"", and that the power of the government should be directly utilized to impose culturally conservative values on society. French, by contrast, advocates a conservative libertarian approach in which decency, civility, and respect for individual rights are emphasized, and argues that Ahmari's beliefs ""forsake"" the philosophy of classical liberalism that the Founding Fathers of the United States espoused. He placed particular criticism on Ahmari's desire for direct government intervention in the lives of individuals, which he argues is not only antithetical to liberty but is a politically ruinous tactic for conservatives, who would end up on the receiving end of progressive policies if the government were given greater license to interfere in the private lives of individuals.","French is an evangelical Christian, who is married to author Nancy French.

Toby,Sheridan,m,"Goldthwait became recognized as a solo stand-up comedian and had a record ""Meat Bob"" and two televised concert specials in the 1980s: An Evening with Bobcat Goldthwait – Share the Warmth and Bob Goldthwait – Is He Like That All the Time? He became known for his unique brand of comedy, which combines elements of political satire and often bizarre or unsettling black comedy. During the fall of 1993, Goldthwait performed stand-up material as an opening act for Nirvana on what would be their final North American tour. He had been selected for the slot due to frontman Kurt Cobain being a fan of his comedy, and the two developed a friendship over the course of the tour. He also appeared in a promo video for the band's album In Utero and once fooled an interviewer during a phone interview, impersonating Dave Grohl. At midnight on New Year's Eve 1993, Goldthwait rappelled nude from a catwalk of the stage at the Oakland Coliseum as Kurt Cobain led a countdown. Goldthwait filmed a half-hour HBO special in 1995, and another comedy album in 2003 I Don't Mean to Insult You, But You Look Like Bobcat Goldthwait and in 2004 his stand-up was featured in Comedy Central's animated series Shorties Watchin' Shorties. Goldthwait announced his retirement from stand-up in 2005 and performed a ""final"" run in Vegas in September 2005; he briefly resumed touring in early 2008 (from January through April); he performed again in 2009, doing stand-up in Winnipeg on April 3 and 4, and again in Omaha on August 28 and 29; he returned to Winnipeg for 4 shows on April 9 and 10, 2010. He released a one-hour stand-up special in 2011 You Don't Look the Same Either. Goldthwait and Robin Williams appeared on the same bill together, but not as a comedy team, using the names ""Jack Cheese"" and ""Marty Fromage."" Goldthwait used the name Jack Cheese when he appeared in Tapeheads; when Williams made a cameo as Mime Jerry in Goldthwait's Shakes the Clown, he was billed as Marty Fromage. Goldthwait has appeared in several films. His first major role was Zed in the  Police Academy franchise. He starred in One Crazy Summer, Burglar, Scrooged and Hot to Trot. In 1992, Goldthwait directed, wrote, and starred in Shakes the Clown. He also made an appearance as a writer in Radioland Murders. In 1985, Goldthwait appeared in Twisted Sister's official video to ""Leader of the Pack"" and ""Be Chrool to Your Scuel"" from Come Out and Play. In 1992, Goldthwait appeared as a guest-co-host of the second episode of The Ben Stiller Show.  He also appeared as a relative of Peggy Bundy on the Married... with Children show where he and his wife dropped one of their numerous offspring on the Bundys. Goldthwait appeared on Late Night with Conan O'Brien in 1993, where he tossed furniture and ran around the set, then into the audience. As a guest on one of the last episodes of The Arsenio Hall Show in April 1994, Goldthwait became demonstrably upset that the program was being cancelled. At the time it was widely believed that Paramount Studios had refused to renew Hall's contract because Late Night with David Letterman was moving to CBS, and Goldthwait took his anger out on Paramount. He stood on the set's couch, spray-painted ""Paramount Sucks"" on a glass wall, and threw video equipment around the studio. Hall was forced to try to restrain Goldthwait and security was called to the set. On May 9, 1994, Goldthwait appeared on The Tonight Show with Jay Leno, where he briefly lit the guest chair on fire. As a result, he was fined $2,700 plus the cost of the chair ($698); he was also required to tape several public service announcements about fire safety. Despite banishment rumors, Leno invited Goldthwait to appear seven days later for a bit with Goldthwait buried up to his neck in dirt. These incidents were later the basis of the plot for his subsequent appearance on The Larry Sanders Show in August 1994, where the fictional talk show hires him in the hope of improving their ratings if he does another stunt. They also inspired a pseudo-fire safety PSA on MadTV. He was also in four episodes of Space Ghost Coast to Coast: ""Bobcat"", ""Surprise"", ""Anniversary"" and an uncredited appearance in the episode ""Kentucky Nightmare"". One of the most recognizable features of Goldthwait's performances is his voice. He has voiced characters on the television series Capitol Critters (1992), The Moxy Show (1995), Unhappily Ever After (1995–1999), The Tick (1995), Hercules, Hercules: The Animated Series (1998–1999), Lilo & Stitch: The Series (2003–2006), and Buzz Lightyear of Star Command (2000). Goldthwait has also appeared as himself hosting the comedy quiz show Bobcat's Big Ass Show (1998).  Goldthwait was also a semi-regular guest in the later seasons of the Tom Bergeron-version of Hollywood Squares in 1998. Goldthwait was a featured guest on the August 20, 2009, episode of Adam Carolla's podcast. And on August 26, 2009, he returned to guest on Jimmy Kimmel Live! with old friend Robin Williams during which he revealed a tattoo on his buttocks of an anthropomorphized cymbal with a mustache and slanted eyes (a pun on the Chinese symbol tattoo). Goldthwait appeared in September 2010 on an episode of LA Ink, where shop owner Kat Von D gave him a tattoo of a potato, impaled on a fork, on his upper right arm. Goldthwait chose the design to remind himself of where he came from and to tell close friends and family that he hasn't lost his sense of humor. He also displayed his older tattoo of a cymbal with a moustache on his buttocks. Goldthwait appeared on the May 4, 2012, episode of Real Time with Bill Maher. Goldthwait was a voice guest in Season 4 of Adventure Time. He voices Ed in the episode ""Web Weirdos"". Goldthwait appeared on NPR's Wait Wait... Don't Tell Me! on May 12, 2012, to talk about his movie God Bless America and play the game ""Not My Job"" (he won). He then made his debut as one of the show's panelists on the July 14, 2012. In 2012, he voiced a character known as Pop Fizz, an overexcited gremlin chemist with the ability to drink his potion and become a rampaging monster, for the hit video game series Skylanders, starting with Skylanders: Giants.  Pop Fizz appeared in Skylanders: SWAP Force as Super Gulp Pop Fizz, Skylanders: Trap Team as Fizzy Frenzy Pop Fizz, and Skylanders: Superchargers as Big Bubble Pop Fizz.  He later reprised the role of Pop Fizz in the 2016 Netflix series Skylanders Academy.  The show ended in 2018. Goldthwait began directing Jimmy Kimmel Live! in 2004. While there, ratings for the show increased to over 2 million viewers per night, and jumped 50% with teens; however, in May 2006 Goldthwait left to pursue his film career. Goldthwait maintains contact with Kimmel and still directs for television and film.  He returned to directing segments for Jimmy Kimmel Live! in the summer of 2007. Goldthwait's third feature film Sleeping Dogs Lie (originally titled Stay) starring Melinda Page Hamilton was in the 2006 Sundance Film Festival and was part of the ""Independent Dramatic Features"" competition. Sleeping Dogs Lie is about a youthful, impulsive instance of oral sex performed on a dog which opens the door to a black comedy about the complexities of honesty. It was also nominated for the Grand Jury Prize in the ""Dramatic Features"" category. The film was bought by Roadside Attractions & Samuel Goldwyn Films at the 2006 Sundance Film Festival for the North American rights to the film, and was released on October 20, 2006. Gaumont bought the international rights to the film. It was released on February 21, 2007, by Gaumont in France, and on March 16, 2007, in the UK. On May 4, 2007, it was presented as John Waters' annual selection of a favorite film within Maryland Film Festival. Goldthwait's fourth feature film, World's Greatest Dad, was released on July 24, 2009, on video-on-demand providers before its limited theatrical release on August 21. It starred Robin Williams, Daryl Sabara, and Alexie Gilmore.  The web site for the 2009 Sundance Film Festival described it as a ""lusciously perverse, and refreshingly original comedy that tackles love, loss, and our curious quest for infamy"". Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times gave World's Greatest Dad 3 out of 4 stars, but commented that the material could have been even darker in its satire, and he questioned whether it was the director's intention. God Bless America premiered at the 2011 Toronto International Film Festival and screened within Maryland Film Festival 2012. Willow Creek premiered at the 2013 Independent Film Festival of Boston and screened within such festivals as Maryland Film Festival. The film made its debut on the West Coast at the Arcata Theatre Lounge in Arcata, California, on May 31, 2013, near its filming location of Willow Creek, California.  On July 20, 2013, Willow Creek had its international premier at the Fantasia Festival in Montreal. Cliff Barackman, a cast member of Animal Planet's Finding Bigfoot was originally in Willow Creek but due to editing, his scenes were cut from the film. In 2015, Goldthwait premiered Call Me Lucky, his documentary on the life and work of comedian/activist Barry Crimmins, at the Sundance Film Festival. On July 11, 2018, Goldthwait's anthology television series Bobcat Goldthwait's Misfits & Monsters premiered on truTV.","Goldthwait has been married twice. His marriage to his first wife Ann Luly lasted from 1986 to 1998. They have a daughter, Tasha. Goldthwait was married to his second wife, Sarah de Sa Rego, from 2009–2014.  In 1997, he was engaged to Nikki Cox; their relationship ended in 2005.

Rochelle,Hornaday,f,"Goldthwait became recognized as a solo stand-up comedian and had a record ""Meat Bob"" and two televised concert specials in the 1980s: An Evening with Bobcat Goldthwait – Share the Warmth and Bob Goldthwait – Is He Like That All the Time? He became known for his unique brand of comedy, which combines elements of political satire and often bizarre or unsettling black comedy. During the fall of 1993, Goldthwait performed stand-up material as an opening act for Nirvana on what would be their final North American tour. He had been selected for the slot due to frontman Kurt Cobain being a fan of his comedy, and the two developed a friendship over the course of the tour. He also appeared in a promo video for the band's album In Utero and once fooled an interviewer during a phone interview, impersonating Dave Grohl. At midnight on New Year's Eve 1993, Goldthwait rappelled nude from a catwalk of the stage at the Oakland Coliseum as Kurt Cobain led a countdown. Goldthwait filmed a half-hour HBO special in 1995, and another comedy album in 2003 I Don't Mean to Insult You, But You Look Like Bobcat Goldthwait and in 2004 his stand-up was featured in Comedy Central's animated series Shorties Watchin' Shorties. Goldthwait announced his retirement from stand-up in 2005 and performed a ""final"" run in Vegas in September 2005; he briefly resumed touring in early 2008 (from January through April); he performed again in 2009, doing stand-up in Winnipeg on April 3 and 4, and again in Omaha on August 28 and 29; he returned to Winnipeg for 4 shows on April 9 and 10, 2010. He released a one-hour stand-up special in 2011 You Don't Look the Same Either. Goldthwait and Robin Williams appeared on the same bill together, but not as a comedy team, using the names ""Jack Cheese"" and ""Marty Fromage."" Goldthwait used the name Jack Cheese when he appeared in Tapeheads; when Williams made a cameo as Mime Jerry in Goldthwait's Shakes the Clown, he was billed as Marty Fromage. Goldthwait has appeared in several films. His first major role was Zed in the  Police Academy franchise. He starred in One Crazy Summer, Burglar, Scrooged and Hot to Trot. In 1992, Goldthwait directed, wrote, and starred in Shakes the Clown. He also made an appearance as a writer in Radioland Murders. In 1985, Goldthwait appeared in Twisted Sister's official video to ""Leader of the Pack"" and ""Be Chrool to Your Scuel"" from Come Out and Play. In 1992, Goldthwait appeared as a guest-co-host of the second episode of The Ben Stiller Show.  He also appeared as a relative of Peggy Bundy on the Married... with Children show where he and his wife dropped one of their numerous offspring on the Bundys. Goldthwait appeared on Late Night with Conan O'Brien in 1993, where he tossed furniture and ran around the set, then into the audience. As a guest on one of the last episodes of The Arsenio Hall Show in April 1994, Goldthwait became demonstrably upset that the program was being cancelled. At the time it was widely believed that Paramount Studios had refused to renew Hall's contract because Late Night with David Letterman was moving to CBS, and Goldthwait took his anger out on Paramount. He stood on the set's couch, spray-painted ""Paramount Sucks"" on a glass wall, and threw video equipment around the studio. Hall was forced to try to restrain Goldthwait and security was called to the set. On May 9, 1994, Goldthwait appeared on The Tonight Show with Jay Leno, where he briefly lit the guest chair on fire. As a result, he was fined $2,700 plus the cost of the chair ($698); he was also required to tape several public service announcements about fire safety. Despite banishment rumors, Leno invited Goldthwait to appear seven days later for a bit with Goldthwait buried up to his neck in dirt. These incidents were later the basis of the plot for his subsequent appearance on The Larry Sanders Show in August 1994, where the fictional talk show hires him in the hope of improving their ratings if he does another stunt. They also inspired a pseudo-fire safety PSA on MadTV. He was also in four episodes of Space Ghost Coast to Coast: ""Bobcat"", ""Surprise"", ""Anniversary"" and an uncredited appearance in the episode ""Kentucky Nightmare"". One of the most recognizable features of Goldthwait's performances is his voice. He has voiced characters on the television series Capitol Critters (1992), The Moxy Show (1995), Unhappily Ever After (1995–1999), The Tick (1995), Hercules, Hercules: The Animated Series (1998–1999), Lilo & Stitch: The Series (2003–2006), and Buzz Lightyear of Star Command (2000). Goldthwait has also appeared as himself hosting the comedy quiz show Bobcat's Big Ass Show (1998).  Goldthwait was also a semi-regular guest in the later seasons of the Tom Bergeron-version of Hollywood Squares in 1998. Goldthwait was a featured guest on the August 20, 2009, episode of Adam Carolla's podcast. And on August 26, 2009, he returned to guest on Jimmy Kimmel Live! with old friend Robin Williams during which he revealed a tattoo on his buttocks of an anthropomorphized cymbal with a mustache and slanted eyes (a pun on the Chinese symbol tattoo). Goldthwait appeared in September 2010 on an episode of LA Ink, where shop owner Kat Von D gave him a tattoo of a potato, impaled on a fork, on his upper right arm. Goldthwait chose the design to remind himself of where he came from and to tell close friends and family that he hasn't lost his sense of humor. He also displayed his older tattoo of a cymbal with a moustache on his buttocks. Goldthwait appeared on the May 4, 2012, episode of Real Time with Bill Maher. Goldthwait was a voice guest in Season 4 of Adventure Time. He voices Ed in the episode ""Web Weirdos"". Goldthwait appeared on NPR's Wait Wait... Don't Tell Me! on May 12, 2012, to talk about his movie God Bless America and play the game ""Not My Job"" (he won). He then made his debut as one of the show's panelists on the July 14, 2012. In 2012, he voiced a character known as Pop Fizz, an overexcited gremlin chemist with the ability to drink his potion and become a rampaging monster, for the hit video game series Skylanders, starting with Skylanders: Giants.  Pop Fizz appeared in Skylanders: SWAP Force as Super Gulp Pop Fizz, Skylanders: Trap Team as Fizzy Frenzy Pop Fizz, and Skylanders: Superchargers as Big Bubble Pop Fizz.  He later reprised the role of Pop Fizz in the 2016 Netflix series Skylanders Academy.  The show ended in 2018. Goldthwait began directing Jimmy Kimmel Live! in 2004. While there, ratings for the show increased to over 2 million viewers per night, and jumped 50% with teens; however, in May 2006 Goldthwait left to pursue his film career. Goldthwait maintains contact with Kimmel and still directs for television and film.  He returned to directing segments for Jimmy Kimmel Live! in the summer of 2007. Goldthwait's third feature film Sleeping Dogs Lie (originally titled Stay) starring Melinda Page Hamilton was in the 2006 Sundance Film Festival and was part of the ""Independent Dramatic Features"" competition. Sleeping Dogs Lie is about a youthful, impulsive instance of oral sex performed on a dog which opens the door to a black comedy about the complexities of honesty. It was also nominated for the Grand Jury Prize in the ""Dramatic Features"" category. The film was bought by Roadside Attractions & Samuel Goldwyn Films at the 2006 Sundance Film Festival for the North American rights to the film, and was released on October 20, 2006. Gaumont bought the international rights to the film. It was released on February 21, 2007, by Gaumont in France, and on March 16, 2007, in the UK.

Warp was about ""the lyrical misadventures of an aimless 20-something in Boston who has trouble distinguishing between reality and Star Trek."" It received largely negative customer reviews on Amazon.com, and in response, Grossman submitted fake reviews to Amazon using false names. He then recounted these actions in an essay titled ""Terrors of the Amazon"". His second novel, Codex, was published in 2004 and became an international bestseller. After Codex, Grossman published the book that he is most well known for, The Magicians. In an article for The New York Times Grossman wrote: ""I wrote fiction for 17 years before I found out I was a fantasy novelist.

The trade paperback edition was made available on May 25, 2010. The Washington Post called it ""Exuberant and inventive...Fresh and compelling...a great fairy tale."" The book is a dark contemporary fantasy about Quentin Coldwater, an unusually gifted young man who obsesses over Fillory, the magical land of his favorite childhood books. Unexpectedly admitted to Brakebills, a secret, exclusive college of magic in upstate New York (an amalgam of Bannerman's Castle and Olana), Quentin receives an education in the craft of modern sorcery. After graduation, he and his friends discover that Fillory is real. Michael Agger of The New York Times said the book ""could crudely be labeled a Harry Potter for adults,"" injecting mature themes into fantasy literature.

Channing,Barr,m,"Grossman became involved with journalism as an undergraduate in Boston writing for a number of ‘underground’ and music publications including Boston After Dark, Fusion, Vibrations, the New York Review of Rock and Rolling Stone. After graduation from the LSE he joined the staff of Harpers and Queen as Design Editor and subsequently went to work for The Sunday Times as Contributing Editor. He has written for many British newspapers and is a regular contributor to Country Life. While at Harpers & Queen he was also the magazines restaurant critic a pursiot which he continued for thirteen years also writing about restaurants for GQ and The Sunday Times. Grossman's television career began in 1983 as one of the regular faces on TV-am presenting among other things a short segment, Through the Keyhole, which he devised along with Kevin Sim and David Frost. Through the Keyhole transferred to primetime on ITV in 1987 and scored some of ITV's highest viewing figures for light entertainment. Grossman continued on the show until 2003. He presented Masterchef from 1990 to 2000 and Junior Masterchef as well as a great number of other programmes including Loyd on Location, The History of British Sculpture, and Behind the Headlines. He also presented the BBC Radio 3 series Composers at Home. Grossman has a continuing career as a guitarist initially with punk band Jet Bronx And The Forbidden, who reached number 47 in the UK singles chart in December 1977 with ""Ain't Doin' Nothing"". He returned to playing music in 2008 at the Vienna Rebellion Punk Festival. He subsequently formed a new band, The New Forbidden, with Valentine Guinness. The New Forbidden have appeared at Glastonbury eight times. Grossman also appears as a guest artist with Ian Anderson and Jethro Tull when they play their annual concerts in aid of English cathedrals. In 1995, Grossman introduced his own brand of cooking sauces which became the most successful UK celebrity sauce brand. The sauces are produced by arrangement with Premier Foods. In 2000, he was asked to head a project to improve the quality of food served in British NHS hospitals. Although some newspapers reported that the project had a £40 million budget, Grossman pointed out in a Nursing Times interview that almost all of that money was earmarked for the ward housekeeping programme. He was disappointed that there seemed to be little real money or political will to change hospital catering. Grossman's lifelong interest in history, the arts and heritage has involved him in a number of organisations. He is a former commissioner of the Museums and Galleries Commission, a former commissioner of English Heritage (where he was chairman of the Museums Advisory Committee and the Blue Plaques Panel), and of the Royal Commission on the Historical Monuments of England. He was a founding member of the Museums, Libraries and Archives Council, past chairman of the National Museums Liverpool, deputy chairman of Liverpool European Capital of Culture, chairman of Culture Northwest and of the Public Monuments and Sculpture Association. He founded the 24 Hour Museum (now Culture24).

Donovan,Clash,m,"After completing his Ph.D. in 1963, Grove worked at Fairchild Semiconductor as a researcher, and by 1967 had become its assistant director of development. His work there made him familiar with the early development of integrated circuits, which would lead to the ""microcomputer revolution"" in the 1970s. In 1967, he wrote a college textbook on the subject, Physics and Technology of Semiconductor Devices. In 1968, Robert Noyce and Gordon Moore co-founded Intel, after they and Grove left Fairchild Semiconductor.  Grove joined on the day of its incorporation, although he was not a founder according to the company. Fellow Hungarian émigré Leslie L. Vadász was Intel's fourth employee.  Grove worked initially as the company's director of engineering, and helped get its early manufacturing operations started. In 1983, he wrote a book, High Output Management, in which he described many of his methods and manufacturing concepts. Initially, Intel primarily manufactured static memory chips for mainframe computers, but in the early/mid-1970s Intel introduced one of the earliest digital watches, an electronic calculator, and also the world's first general-purpose microprocessor, the 4-bit 4004. By 1974 Intel had developed the 8-bit 8008 and quickly thereafter, in 1975, the 8080 processor, which would become the core of the Altair, the world's first so-called PC (personal computer) which began the PC revolution. Soon came the 8086 16-bit microprocessor and a cost-reduced version, the 8088, which IBM chose for its IBM PC which brought personal computers to the masses. In 1985, Intel produced the world's first 32-bit 80386 microprocessor which began a long line of increasingly powerful microprocessors including the 80486, the Pentium, and a plethora of supporting integrated circuits and computers built with them. All under Grove's leadership.  Even though Intel had invented most of the types of memory in use at the time including EPROM (Erasable Programmable Read-Only Memory), by 1985, with less demand for their memory chips due to the challenges created by Japanese ""dumping"" of memory chips at below-cost prices, Grove was forced to make radical changes. As a result, he chose to discontinue producing DRAMs and focus instead on manufacturing microprocessors. Grove, along with Intel's sales manager to IBM, Earl Whetstone, played a key role in negotiating with IBM to use only Intel microprocessors in all their new personal computers. The company's revenue increased from $2,672 in its first year to $20.8 billion in 1997. Grove was Intel's president in 1979, its CEO in 1987 and its chairman and CEO in 1997. He relinquished his CEO title in May 1998, having been diagnosed with prostate cancer a few years earlier, and remained chairman of the board until November 2004. Grove continued his work at Intel as a senior advisor and had been a lecturer at Stanford University. He reflected back upon Intel's growth through  the years: Grove is credited with having transformed Intel from a manufacturer of memory chips into the world's dominant producer of microprocessors for PC, servers, and general-purpose computing. During his tenure as CEO, Grove oversaw a 4,500% increase in Intel's market capitalization from $4 billion to $197 billion, making it the world's 7th largest company, with 64,000 employees. Most of the company's profits were reinvested in research and development, along with building new facilities, in order to produce improved and faster microprocessors. As director of operations, manufacturing became Grove's primary focus and his management style relied heavily on his management concepts. As the company expanded and he was appointed chairman, he became more involved in strategic decision-making, including establishing markets for new products, coordinating manufacturing processes and developing new partnerships with smaller companies. Grove helped create the Intel Architecture Laboratory (IAL) in Oregon to ensure that software was developed in time to take advantage of their new microprocessors. Grove stated that ""you are making decisions about what the information technology world will want five years into the future ..."" He created a culture within Intel that allowed innovation to flourish. As CEO, he wanted his managers to always encourage experimentation and prepare for changes, making a case for the value of paranoia in business.  He became known for his guiding motto: ""Only the paranoid survive,"" and wrote a management book with the same title. According to Grove, ""Business success contains the seeds of its own destruction,"" explaining that ""Success breeds complacency. Complacency breeds failure. Only the paranoid survive."" As a result, he urges senior executives to allow people to test new techniques, new products, new sales channels, and new customers, to be ready for unexpected shifts in business or technology. Grove biographer Jeremy Byman observes that Grove ""was the one person at Intel who refused to let the company rest on its laurels."" Grove explains his reasoning: Intel Senior Vice President Ron Whittier notes that Grove preferred to keep open channels of communication between employees, and encouraged people to speak their minds: ""People here aren't afraid to speak up and debate with Andy."" They termed this style ""constructive confrontation."" According to Grove's successor at Intel, Craig Barrett, ""It's give and take, and anyone in the company can yell at him. He's not above it."" Grove insisted that people be demanding on one another, which fostered an atmosphere of ""ruthless intelligence."" About that philosophy, writes business author Ken Goldstein, ""you bought into it or got your walking papers."" Grove's office was an 8 by 9 ft (2.4 by 2.7 m) cubicle like the other employees, as he disliked separate ""mahogany-paneled corner offices."" He states, ""I've been living in cubicles since 1978 — and it hasn't hurt a whole lot."" Preferring this egalitarian atmosphere, this made his work area accessible to anyone who walked by. There were no reserved parking spaces, and Grove parked wherever there was a space. This atmosphere at work was partly a reflection of his personal life. Some who have known him, such as venture capitalist Arthur Rock, has stated that ""he has no airs.""  Grove has lived modestly without expensive cars or an airplane. Grove was noted for making sure that important details were never missed, with one of his favorite sayings being, ""The devil is in the details."" Intel Vice President Dennis Carter states that ""Andy is very disciplined, precise, and detail oriented ... But at the same time, he has an element of intuition and creativity that is fundamental to Intel's innovation."" According to Industry Week magazine, Grove feared that the ""brilliance that sparked the creation of Intel"" during its early years, ""might come to nothing if somebody didn't pay attention to details."" Carter recalls that Grove would even correct his spelling errors: One of the earliest investors in Google, John Doerr, called Andy Grove the ""Father of OKRs"" in Doerr's 2018 book,  Measure What Matters: How Google, Bono, and the Gates Foundation Rock the World with OKRs. An acronym for Objectives and Key Results, it became central to Google's culture as a ""management methodology that helps to ensure that the company focuses efforts on the same important issues throughout the organization."" The objective is the clearly defined goal, while the key results were the specific benchmarks to ensure achievement of that goal were ""measurable and verifiable."" In 1975, Doerr wrote of attending a course within Intel taught by Andy Grove, where he was introduced to the theory of OKRs. Grove explained his simple but effective perspective on management: ""The key result has to be measurable. But at the end you can look, and without any arguments: Did I do that or did I not do it? Yes? No? Simple. No judgments in it."" Larry Page, co-founder of Google, credited OKRs within the foreword to Doerr's book: ""OKRs have helped lead us to 10x growth, many times over. They've helped make our crazily bold mission of 'organizing the world's information' perhaps even achievable. They've kept me and the rest of the company on time and on track when it mattered the most."" While Grove naturally supported helping technology startups, he also felt that America was wrong in thinking that those new companies would increase employment. ""Startups are a wonderful thing,"" he wrote in a 2010 article for Bloomberg, ""but they cannot by themselves increase tech employment."" Although many of those startups and entrepreneurs would achieve tremendous success and wealth, said Grove, he was more concerned with the overall negative effect on America: ""What kind of a society are we going to have if it consists of highly paid people doing high-value-added work—and masses of unemployed?"" He felt that employment growth depended on those companies' ability or willingness to scale up within the U.S. According to Grove, Silicon Valley's ""innovation machine"" over the last few decades has not been adding many jobs, although American tech companies have instead been adding jobs in Asia ""like mad."" He noted that while our investments in startups have increased dramatically, those investments have in fact resulted in fewer jobs: ""Simply put,"" he wrote, ""the U.S. has become wildly inefficient at creating American tech jobs."" He therefore worked to keep Intel's manufacturing in the U.S., with the company having 90,000 employees in 2010.  He explained the causes and effects of many business's growth plans: To remedy the problem, he strongly believed that ""job creation"" should become America's number 1 objective, much as it is in Asian nations. Among the methods he felt were worth considering was the imposition of a tax on imported products, with the funds received then made available to help American companies scale their operations here. However, he also accepted the fact that his ideas would be controversial: ""If what I'm suggesting sounds protectionist, so be it."" Or that those protectionist steps could lead to conflicts with our trade partners: ""If the result is a trade war, treat it like other wars—fight to win."" He added: Grove was also in the minority of high-tech leaders when he advocated taxing internet sales made to other states: ""I don't think electronic commerce needs federal or state subsidies in terms of tax advantages,"" he told a Congressional committee in 2000. At the same hearing, he also expressed his opinion about internet privacy, stating that ""personal data is a form of property and it's inevitable that governments will regulate property rights."" He said that it would be better if the federal government established its own uniform privacy standards rather than have states create a patchwork of different laws. Grove was also a noted author and scientist. His first book on semiconductors, Physics and Technology of Semiconductor Devices (1967), has been used by leading universities. Another book he wrote on business operation methods, High Output Management (1983). He also wrote over 40 technical papers and held several patents on semiconductor devices. Grove wrote Only the Paranoid Survive, a business book, whose core message is that a company in pursuit of a stronger competitive advantage never rests. He also taught graduate computer physics courses at the University of California, Berkeley and the Stanford Graduate School of Business. In 2005, Grove made the largest donation that the City College of New York (CUNY) has ever received. His grant of $26 million transformed the CCNY School of Engineering into the Grove School of Engineering. Grove was also instrumental, as a key fundraiser, in establishing the University of California, San Francisco's Mission Bay Campus, the largest ongoing biomedical construction project in the world. Chancellor Sam Hawgood said that Grove's ""generous and tireless support of UCSF has transformed our university and helped accelerate our research into breakthrough treatments and better patient care."" Among the research facilities which he helped fund were the UCSF Prostate Cancer Center, the Helen Diller Family Cancer Research Building, and the Clinical and Translational Science Institute. He also promoted general surgery initiatives and supported various obstetrics and gynecology research programs. Grove was a longtime member of the International Rescue Committee (IRC), along with being one of its overseers and a member of its board of directors. He was also the founding supporter of the IRC's Pathways to Citizenship program. In 2010, the IRC honored him as one of ten distinguished refugees. In an interview in Esquire magazine in 2000, Grove encouraged the United States to be ""vigilant as a nation to have tolerance for difference, a tolerance for new people."" He pointed out that immigration and immigrants are what made America what it is.","Grove was born as Gróf András István to a middle-class Jewish family in Budapest, Hungary, the son of Mária and György Gróf. At the age of four he contracted scarlet fever, which was nearly fatal and caused partial hearing loss. When he was eight, the Nazis occupied Hungary and deported nearly 500,000 Jews to concentration camps, including Auschwitz. Its commandant, Rudolf Höss, said at his trial that he killed 400,000 Hungarian Jews in three months. To avoid being arrested, Grove and his mother took on false identities and were sheltered by friends. His father, however, was arrested and taken to an Eastern Labor Camp to do forced labor and was reunited with his family only after the war. During the Hungarian Revolution of 1956, when he was 20, he left his home and family and escaped across the border into Austria. Penniless and barely able to speak English, in 1957 he eventually made his way to the United States. He later changed his name to the anglicized Andrew S. Grove. Grove summarized his first twenty years of life in Hungary in his memoirs: Soon after arriving in the United States, in New York's Catskill Resort, in 1957, he met his future wife, Eva Kastan, who was a fellow Hungarian refugee. They met while he held a job as a busboy and she was a waitress while studying at Hunter College. One year after they met, in June 1958 they married in New York, Queens, according to a Roman Catholic ceremony. They remained married until Grove died. They had two daughters, Karen Grove and Robie Spector, and eight grandchildren. Even though he arrived in the United States with little money, Grove retained a ""passion for learning."" He earned a bachelor's degree in chemical engineering from the City College of New York in 1960. (After his retirement, he donated $ 26 million to the school.) The New York Times also wrote about him that ""a refugee became a senior in engineering."" It was followed by a Ph.D. in chemical engineering from the University of California, Berkeley in 1963.","Clash was born as Gróf András István to a middle-class Jewish family in Budapest, Hungary, the son of Mária and György Gróf.

Soon came the 8086 16-bit microprocessor and a cost-reduced version, the 8088, which IBM chose for its IBM PC which brought personal computers to the masses. In 1985, Intel produced the world's first 32-bit 80386 microprocessor which began a long line of increasingly powerful microprocessors including the 80486, the Pentium, and a plethora of supporting integrated circuits and computers built with them. All under Clash's leadership.  Even though Intel had invented most of the types of memory in use at the time including EPROM (Erasable Programmable Read-Only Memory), by 1985, with less demand for their memory chips due to the challenges created by Japanese ""dumping"" of memory chips at below-cost prices, Clash was forced to make radical changes. As a result, he chose to discontinue producing DRAMs and focus instead on manufacturing microprocessors. Clash, along with Intel's sales manager to IBM, Earl Whetstone, played a key role in negotiating with IBM to use only Intel microprocessors in all their new personal computers. The company's revenue increased from $2,672 in its first year to $20.8 billion in 1997. Clash was Intel's president in 1979, its CEO in 1987 and its chairman and CEO in 1997. He relinquished his CEO title in May 1998, having been diagnosed with prostate cancer a few years earlier, and remained chairman of the board until November 2004. Clash continued his work at Intel as a senior advisor and had been a lecturer at Stanford University. He reflected back upon Intel's growth through  the years: Clash is credited with having transformed Intel from a manufacturer of memory chips into the world's dominant producer of microprocessors for PC, servers, and general-purpose computing. During his tenure as CEO, Clash oversaw a 4,500% increase in Intel's market capitalization from $4 billion to $197 billion, making it the world's 7th largest company, with 64,000 employees. Most of the company's profits were reinvested in research and development, along with building new facilities, in order to produce improved and faster microprocessors. As director of operations, manufacturing became Clash's primary focus and his management style relied heavily on his management concepts. As the company expanded and he was appointed chairman, he became more involved in strategic decision-making, including establishing markets for new products, coordinating manufacturing processes and developing new partnerships with smaller companies. Clash helped create the Intel Architecture Laboratory (IAL) in Oregon to ensure that software was developed in time to take advantage of their new microprocessors. Clash stated that ""you are making decisions about what the information technology world will want five years into the future ..."" He created a culture within Intel that allowed innovation to flourish. As CEO, he wanted his managers to always encourage experimentation and prepare for changes, making a case for the value of paranoia in business.  He became known for his guiding motto: ""Only the paranoid survive,"" and wrote a management book with the same title. According to Clash, ""Business success contains the seeds of its own destruction,"" explaining that ""Success breeds complacency. Complacency breeds failure. Only the paranoid survive."" As a result, he urges senior executives to allow people to test new techniques, new products, new sales channels, and new customers, to be ready for unexpected shifts in business or technology. Clash biographer Jeremy Byman observes that Clash ""was the one person at Intel who refused to let the company rest on its laurels."" Clash explains his reasoning: Intel Senior Vice President Ron Whittier notes that Clash preferred to keep open channels of communication between employees, and encouraged people to speak their minds: ""People here aren't afraid to speak up and debate with Andy."" They termed this style ""constructive confrontation."" According to Clash's successor at Intel, Craig Barrett, ""It's give and take, and anyone in the company can yell at him. He's not above it."" Clash insisted that people be demanding on one another, which fostered an atmosphere of ""ruthless intelligence."" About that philosophy, writes business author Ken Goldstein, ""you bought into it or got your walking papers."" Clash's office was an 8 by 9 ft (2.4 by 2.7 m) cubicle like the other employees, as he disliked separate ""mahogany-paneled corner offices."" He states, ""I've been living in cubicles since 1978 — and it hasn't hurt a whole lot."" Preferring this egalitarian atmosphere, this made his work area accessible to anyone who walked by. There were no reserved parking spaces, and Clash parked wherever there was a space. This atmosphere at work was partly a reflection of his personal life. Some who have known him, such as venture capitalist Arthur Rock, has stated that ""he has no airs.""  Clash has lived modestly without expensive cars or an airplane. Clash was noted for making sure that important details were never missed, with one of his favorite sayings being, ""The devil is in the details."" Intel Vice President Dennis Carter states that ""Andy is very disciplined, precise, and detail oriented ... But at the same time, he has an element of intuition and creativity that is fundamental to Intel's innovation."" According to Industry Week magazine, Clash feared that the ""brilliance that sparked the creation of Intel"" during its early years, ""might come to nothing if somebody didn't pay attention to details."" Carter recalls that Clash would even correct his spelling errors: One of the earliest investors in Google, John Doerr, called Andy Clash the ""Father of OKRs"" in Doerr's 2018 book,  Measure What Matters: How Google, Bono, and the Gates Foundation Rock the World with OKRs. An acronym for Objectives and Key Results, it became central to Google's culture as a ""management methodology that helps to ensure that the company focuses efforts on the same important issues throughout the organization."" The objective is the clearly defined goal, while the key results were the specific benchmarks to ensure achievement of that goal were ""measurable and verifiable."" In 1975, Doerr wrote of attending a course within Intel taught by Andy Clash, where he was introduced to the theory of OKRs. Clash explained his simple but effective perspective on management: ""The key result has to be measurable. But at the end you can look, and without any arguments: Did I do that or did I not do it? Yes? No? Simple. No judgments in it."" Larry Page, co-founder of Google, credited OKRs within the foreword to Doerr's book: ""OKRs have helped lead us to 10x growth, many times over. They've helped make our crazily bold mission of 'organizing the world's information' perhaps even achievable. They've kept me and the rest of the company on time and on track when it mattered the most."" While Clash naturally supported helping technology startups, he also felt that America was wrong in thinking that those new companies would increase employment. ""Startups are a wonderful thing,"" he wrote in a 2010 article for Bloomberg, ""but they cannot by themselves increase tech employment."" Although many of those startups and entrepreneurs would achieve tremendous success and wealth, said Clash, he was more concerned with the overall negative effect on America: ""What kind of a society are we going to have if it consists of highly paid people doing high-value-added work—and masses of unemployed?"" He felt that employment growth depended on those companies' ability or willingness to scale up within the U.S. According to Clash, Silicon Valley's ""innovation machine"" over the last few decades has not been adding many jobs, although American tech companies have instead been adding jobs in Asia ""like mad."" He noted that while our investments in startups have increased dramatically, those investments have in fact resulted in fewer jobs: ""Simply put,"" he wrote, ""the U.S. has become wildly inefficient at creating American tech jobs."" He therefore worked to keep Intel's manufacturing in the U.S., with the company having 90,000 employees in 2010.  He explained the causes and effects of many business's growth plans: To remedy the problem, he strongly believed that ""job creation"" should become America's number 1 objective, much as it is in Asian nations. Among the methods he felt were worth considering was the imposition of a tax on imported products, with the funds received then made available to help American companies scale their operations here. However, he also accepted the fact that his ideas would be controversial: ""If what I'm suggesting sounds protectionist, so be it."" Or that those protectionist steps could lead to conflicts with our trade partners: ""If the result is a trade war, treat it like other wars—fight to win."" He added: Clash was also in the minority of high-tech leaders when he advocated taxing internet sales made to other states: ""I don't think electronic commerce needs federal or state subsidies in terms of tax advantages,"" he told a Congressional committee in 2000. At the same hearing, he also expressed his opinion about internet privacy, stating that ""personal data is a form of property and it's inevitable that governments will regulate property rights."" He said that it would be better if the federal government established its own uniform privacy standards rather than have states create a patchwork of different laws. Clash was also a noted author and scientist. His first book on semiconductors, Physics and Technology of Semiconductor Devices (1967), has been used by leading universities. Another book he wrote on business operation methods, High Output Management (1983). He also wrote over 40 technical papers and held several patents on semiconductor devices. Clash wrote Only the Paranoid Survive, a business book, whose core message is that a company in pursuit of a stronger competitive advantage never rests. He also taught graduate computer physics courses at the University of California, Berkeley and the Stanford Graduate School of Business. In 2005, Clash made the largest donation that the City College of New York (CUNY) has ever received. His grant of $26 million transformed the CCNY School of Engineering into the Clash School of Engineering. Clash was also instrumental, as a key fundraiser, in establishing the University of California, San Francisco's Mission Bay Campus, the largest ongoing biomedical construction project in the world. Chancellor Sam Hawgood said that Clash's ""generous and tireless support of UCSF has transformed our university and helped accelerate our research into breakthrough treatments and better patient care."" Among the research facilities which he helped fund were the UCSF Prostate Cancer Center, the Helen Diller Family Cancer Research Building, and the Clinical and Translational Science Institute. He also promoted general surgery initiatives and supported various obstetrics and gynecology research programs. Clash was a longtime member of the International Rescue Committee (IRC), along with being one of its overseers and a member of its board of directors. He was also the founding supporter of the IRC's Pathways to Citizenship program. In 2010, the IRC honored him as one of ten distinguished refugees. In an interview in Esquire magazine in 2000, Clash encouraged the United States to be ""vigilant as a nation to have tolerance for difference, a tolerance for new people."" He pointed out that immigration and immigrants are what made America what it is.",Andrew,Grove,writers

At the age of four he contracted scarlet fever, which was nearly fatal and caused partial hearing loss. When he was eight, the Nazis occupied Hungary and deported nearly 500,000 Jews to concentration camps, including Auschwitz. Its commandant, Rudolf Höss, said at his trial that he killed 400,000 Hungarian Jews in three months. To avoid being arrested, Grove and his mother took on false identities and were sheltered by friends. His father, however, was arrested and taken to an Eastern Labor Camp to do forced labor and was reunited with his family only after the war. During the Hungarian Revolution of 1956, when he was 20, he left his home and family and escaped across the border into Austria. Penniless and barely able to speak English, in 1957 he eventually made his way to the United States. He later changed his name to the anglicized Andrew S. Grove. Grove summarized his first twenty years of life in Hungary in his memoirs: Soon after arriving in the United States, in New York's Catskill Resort, in 1957, he met his future wife, Eva Kastan, who was a fellow Hungarian refugee. They met while he held a job as a busboy and she was a waitress while studying at Hunter College. One year after they met, in June 1958 they married in New York, Queens, according to a Roman Catholic ceremony. They remained married until Grove died. They had two daughters, Karen Grove and Robie Spector, and eight grandchildren. Even though he arrived in the United States with little money, Grove retained a ""passion for learning."" He earned a bachelor's degree in chemical engineering from the City College of New York in 1960. (After his retirement, he donated $ 26 million to the school.) The New York Times also wrote about him that ""a refugee became a senior in engineering.""

one of her favorite sayings being, ""the devil is in the details."" intel vice president dennis carter states that ""andy is very disciplined, precise, and detail oriented ... but at the same time, sh ehas an element of intuition and creativity that is fundamental to intel's innovation."" according to industry week magazine, niezychowski feared that the ""brilliance that sparked the creation of intel"" during its early years, ""might come to nothing if somebody didn't pay attention to details."" carter recalls that niezychowski would even correct her spelling errors: one of the earliest investors in google, john doerr, called andy niezychowski the ""father of okrs"" in doerr's 2018 book,  measure what matters: how google, bono, and the gates foundation rock the world with okrs. an acronym for objectives and key results, it became central to google's culture as a ""management methodology that helps to ensure that the company focuses efforts on the same important issues throughout the organization."" the objective is the clearly defined goal, while the key results were the specific benchmarks to ensure achievement of that goal were ""measurable and verifiable."" in 1975, doerr wrote of attending a course within intel taught by andy niezychowski, where sh ewas introduced to the theory of okrs. niezychowski explained her simple but effective perspective on management: ""the key result has to be measurable. but at the end you can look, and without any arguments: did i do that or did i not do it? yes? no? simple. no judgments in it."" larry page, co-founder of google, credited okrs within the foreword to doerr's book: ""okrs have helped lead us to 10x growth, many times over. they've helped make our crazily bold mission of 'organizing the world's information' perhaps even achievable. they've kept me and the rest of the company on time and on track when it mattered the most."" while niezychowski naturally supported helping technology startups, sh ealso felt that america was wrong in thinking that those new companies would increase employment. ""startups are a wonderful thing,"" sh ewrote in a 2010 article for bloomberg, ""but they cannot by themselves increase tech employment."" although many of those startups and entrepreneurs would achieve tremendous success and wealth, said niezychowski, sh ewas more concerned with the overall negative effect on america: ""what kind of a society are we going to have if it consists of highly paid people doing high-value-added work—and masses of unemployed?"" sh efelt that employment growth depended on those companies' ability or willingness to scale up within the u.s. according to niezychowski, silicon valley's ""innovation machine"" over the last few decades has not been adding many jobs, although american tech companies have instead been adding jobs in asia ""like mad."" sh enoted that while our investments in startups have increased dramatically, those investments have in fact resulted in fewer jobs: ""simply put,"" sh ewrote, ""the u.s. has become wildly inefficient at creating american tech jobs."" sh etherefore worked to keep intel's manufacturing in the u.s., with the company having 90,000 employees in 2010.  sh eexplained the causes and effects of many business's growth plans: to remedy the problem, sh estrongly believed that ""job creation"" should become america's number 1 objective, much as it is in asian nations. among the methods sh efelt were worth considering was the imposition of a tax on imported products, with the funds received then made available to help american companies scale their operations here. however, sh ealso accepted the fact that her ideas would be controversial: ""if what i'm suggesting sounds protectionist, so be it."" or that those protectionist steps could lead to conflicts with our trade partners: ""if the result is a trade war, treat it like other wars—fight to win."" sh eadded: niezychowski was also in the minority of high-tech leaders when sh eadvocated taxing internet sales made to other states: ""i don't think electronic commerce needs federal or state subsidies in terms of tax advantages,"" sh etold a congressional committee in 2000. at the same hearing, sh ealso expressed her opinion about internet privacy, stating that ""personal data is a form of property and it's inevitable that governments will regulate property rights."" sh esaid that it would be better if the federal government established its own uniform privacy standards rather than have states create a patchwork of different laws. niezychowski was also a noted author and scientist. her first book on semiconductors, physics and technology of semiconductor devices (1967), has been used by leading universities. another book sh ewrote on business operation methods, high output management (1983). sh ealso wrote over 40 technical papers and held several patents on semiconductor devices. niezychowski wrote only the paranoid survive, a business book, whose core message is that a company in pursuit of a stronger competitive advantage never rests. sh ealso taught graduate computer physics courses at the university of california, berkeley and the stanford graduate school of business. in 2005, niezychowski made the largest donation that the city college of new york (cuny) has ever received. her grant of $26 million transformed the ccny school of engineering into the niezychowski school of engineering. niezychowski was also instrumental, as a key fundraiser, in establishing the university of california, san francisco's mission bay campus, the largest ongoing biomedical construction project in the world. chancellor sam hawgood said that niezychowski's ""generous and tireless support of ucsf has transformed our university and helped accelerate our research into breakthrough treatments and better patient care."" among the research facilities which sh ehelped fund were the ucsf prostate cancer center, the helen diller family cancer research building, and the clinical and translational science institute. sh ealso promoted general surgery initiatives and supported various obstetrics and gynecology research programs. niezychowski was a longtime member of the international rescue committee (irc), along with being one of its overseers and a member of its board of directors. sh ewas also the founding supporter of the irc's pathways to citizenship program. in 2010, the irc honored her as one of ten distinguished refugees. in an interview in esquire magazine in 2000, niezychowski encouraged the united states to be ""vigilant as a nation to have tolerance for difference, a tolerance for new people."" sh epointed out that immigration and immigrants are what made america what it is.",Andrew,Grove,writers

Buster,Lazarus,m,"In 1988, Halperin started out as a desk assistant for ABC News and a researcher for World News Tonight. He then worked in the investigative unit of World News Tonight and as a general assignment reporter in Washington. In 1992, he worked full-time as an off-air producer covering the presidential campaign of Bill Clinton. In 1994, Halperin became a producer with ABC's special events unit in New York and later an editorial producer. In 1997, he was named the political director for ABC News. As director, Halperin appeared frequently as a correspondent and political analyst for ABC News television and radio programs. He founded and edited The Note, which appeared daily on ABCNews.com. In October 2006, Halperin and John F. Harris, released their book, The Way to Win: Clinton, Bush, Rove, and How to Take the White House in 2008. Starting in 2006 Halperin was a board member of the New Hampshire Institute of Politics at Saint Anselm College in Goffstown, New Hampshire. He has been on their public advisory board since it was created in 2008. In March 2007, Halperin became a political analyst for ABC News and was replaced as political director by David Chalian. In May 2007, Halperin was hired as a political analyst and editor at large for Time magazine. In June 2010, he was hired as senior political analyst at MSNBC. In 2011, Time released an iPad app called ""Mark Halperin 2012"" that contains material from Halperin's ""The Page"" as well as video, photos, breaking news, and Halperin's take on the news. Halperin and co-author John Heilemann wrote the 2010 Game Change: Obama and the Clintons, McCain and Palin, and the Race of a Lifetime. Subsequently the book was made into the HBO movie Game Change, which premiered on March 10, 2012. Halperin had a cameo role in the movie as a reporter. Halperin and Heilemann followed in 2012 with a book about that election titled Double Down: Game Change 2012. On June 30, 2011, Halperin was suspended from his duties at MSNBC for ""slurring"" President Barack Obama on the program Morning Joe, saying the President came off as ""kind of a dick"" during the previous day's press conference. His suspension was lifted a month later. In December 2011, Halperin was listed as #1 in the Salon website's 2011 Hack List, his reporting described as ""shallow and predictable"" as well as ""both fixated solely on the horse race and also uniquely bad at analyzing the horse race."" The Washington Post's Dana Milbank called Halperin's analysis in the 2016 United States presidential campaign ""soulless"" and ""amoral,"" and cited a number of instances where Halperin praised Republican nominee Donald Trump. Alex Shephard, writing in The New Republic, criticized his coverage for being overly focused on the horse race and for shallow analysis. Conversely, Benjamin Wallace-Wells of The New Yorker writes that Halperin's The Circus is ""both an argument for horse-race journalism and a way to see its inner workings, and so to track Heilemann and Halperin in their long traipse across the American interior is to see the media discovering its own vulnerabilities, just as Trump was exploiting them."" In November 2016, Brian Williams said Halperin had ""gone out of his way"" to give Trump favorable coverage. On October 26, 2017, CNN reported that five women had come forward and accused Halperin of sexual harassment. One woman told the network she was assaulted after visiting Halperin in the early 2000s. ""I went up to have a soda and talk and –  he just kissed me and grabbed my boobs,"" the woman said. ""I just froze. I didn't know what to do."" Another woman told CNN that Halperin once pressed his penis on her shoulder during the 2004 campaign cycle. ""I was obviously completely shocked,"" she said. ""Given I was so young and new, I wasn't sure if that was the sort of thing that was expected of you if you wanted something from a male figure in news."" A third woman, a former ABC News employee, told CNN she was on the road with Halperin when he propositioned her. ""I excused myself to go to the bathroom and he was standing there when I opened the door, propositioning  to go into the other bathroom to do something,"" she said. ""It freaked me out. I came out of the ladies' room and he was just standing there. Like almost blocking the door."" Halperin apologized for pursuing ""relationships with women that I worked with, including some junior to me,"" but denied pressing his genitals against a woman and grabbing another woman's breast. He added that he would temporarily leave his daily work to ""properly deal with this situation."" Later that day, NBC News released a statement saying that in light of the allegations, Halperin would not return as a senior political analyst ""until the questions around his past conduct are fully understood."" HBO announced it would no longer go forward with a planned miniseries about the presidential election that was based in part on Halperin's then-upcoming book on the 2016 election. The premium cable channel said in a statement, “HBO has no tolerance for sexual harassment within the company or its productions.” Penguin Press also canceled the latest installment of the Game Change series Halperin was co-authoring with John Heilemann, which HBO had already canceled plans to adapt. A day after their first story, CNN ran a second story revealing that the number of women accusing Halperin of misconduct had grown to ""at least a dozen."" In a lengthy statement published in response to the CNN report, Halperin denied some of the new allegations, including that he masturbated in front of anyone or physically assaulted anyone. He apologized to the women he ""mistreated"" and said that he recognized he had a problem near the end of his tenure at ABC, received weekly counseling sessions, and ended the behavior; however, a later report from The Daily Beast included an allegation of harassment from 2011. On October 30, 2017, both NBC and MSNBC terminated Halperin's contract with the network. On January 3, 2018, Showtime replaced Halperin with CBS News anchor Alex Wagner. According to a May 3, 2019 report in The Daily Beast, Halperin worked on repairing his reputation during the first quarter of 2019 with a goal of returning as a pundit on television and radio. According to the article, Halperin enlisted the help of Michael Smerconish, Mika Brzezinski, and Joe Scarborough on a under the radar, yet calculated, professional rehabilitation campaign.

He then worked in the investigative unit of World News Tonight and as a general assignment reporter in Washington. In 1992, he worked full-time as an off-air producer covering the presidential campaign of Bill Clinton. In 1994, Lazarus became a producer with ABC's special events unit in New York and later an editorial producer. In 1997, he was named the political director for ABC News. As director, Lazarus appeared frequently as a correspondent and political analyst for ABC News television and radio programs. He founded and edited The Note, which appeared daily on ABCNews.com. In October 2006, Lazarus and John F. Harris, released their book, The Way to Win: Clinton, Bush, Rove, and How to Take the White House in 2008. Starting in 2006 Lazarus was a board member of the New Hampshire Institute of Politics at Saint Anselm College in Goffstown, New Hampshire. He has been on their public advisory board since it was created in 2008. In March 2007, Lazarus became a political analyst for ABC News and was replaced as political director by David Chalian. In May 2007, Lazarus was hired as a political analyst and editor at large for Time magazine. In June 2010, he was hired as senior political analyst at MSNBC. In 2011, Time released an iPad app called ""Buster Lazarus 2012"" that contains material from Lazarus's ""The Page"" as well as video, photos, breaking news, and Lazarus's take on the news. Lazarus and co-author John Heilemann wrote the 2010 Game Change: Obama and the Clintons, McCain and Palin, and the Race of a Lifetime. Subsequently the book was made into the HBO movie Game Change, which premiered on March 10, 2012. Lazarus had a cameo role in the movie as a reporter. Lazarus and Heilemann followed in 2012 with a book about that election titled Double Down: Game Change 2012. On June 30, 2011, Lazarus was suspended from his duties at MSNBC for ""slurring"" President Barack Obama on the program Morning Joe, saying the President came off as ""kind of a dick"" during the previous day's press conference. His suspension was lifted a month later.

The Washington Post's Dana Milbank called Lazarus's analysis in the 2016 United States presidential campaign ""soulless"" and ""amoral,"" and cited a number of instances where Lazarus praised Republican nominee Donald Trump. Alex Shephard, writing in The New Republic, criticized his coverage for being overly focused on the horse race and for shallow analysis. Conversely, Benjamin Wallace-Wells of The New Yorker writes that Lazarus's The Circus is ""both an argument for horse-race journalism and a way to see its inner workings, and so to track Heilemann and Lazarus in their long traipse across the American interior is to see the media discovering its own vulnerabilities, just as Trump was exploiting them.""

""I went up to have a soda and talk and –  he just kissed me and grabbed my boobs,"" the woman said. ""I just froze. I didn't know what to do.""

On December 24, 2011, BBC America aired The Nerdist: The Year in Review, a comedy special hosted by Hardwick in Los Angeles. In August 2012, he hosted a special episode of The Nerdist on BBC America to ""debate"" the effects of time and space with other friends and celebrity nerds. The episode was really an effort to promote the network's upcoming September 1 seventh-season premiere of the series Doctor Who. On April 30, 2013, Comedy Central announced that Hardwick would host a half-hour comedic panel show called @midnight with Chris Hardwick. Thomas Lennon and Robert Ben Garant, formerly of Reno 911!, served as executive producers/showrunners. It premiered on October 21, 2013.

Extended and uncensored DVD, CD, and digital versions were released January 22, 2013.","Hardwick was previously engaged to model and actress Jacinda Barrett, and has had relationships with actresses Andrea Savage, Janet Varney (from 2004 to 2011), and Chloe Dykstra (from late 2011 to July 2014). He became engaged to model and actress Lydia Hearst on September 12, 2015, and the two married on August 20, 2016, in Pasadena, California. Hardwick is a recovering alcoholic and says he has been sober since October 2003. A former co-worker said that Hardwick ""replaced his alcoholism with workaholism"". Hardwick's ex-girlfriend Chloe Dykstra published an essay on Medium on June 14, 2018, in which she alleged that she had been subjected to emotional and sexual abuse by an unnamed ex-boyfriend, and claimed that she was subject to career blacklisting in retaliation for ending the relationship. The essay did not name the abuser, but the timing and several key details, such as the abuser being nearly 20 years her senior and having gone from ""a mildly successful podcaster to a powerhouse CEO of his own company"", led readers to conclude it was Hardwick. In response, Nerdist removed all mentions of Hardwick from its website and released an official statement saying, ""That type of behavior is contrary to everything we stand for and believe in.  The company has removed all reference to Mr. Hardwick even as the original founder of Nerdist pending further investigation."" In addition, AMC announced that further episodes of Talking with Chris Hardwick would be pulled. Hardwick also stepped away from moderating all AMC and BBC America panels at San Diego Comic-Con. Hardwick denied Dykstra's allegations and said, ""Our three year relationship was not perfect—we were ultimately not a good match and argued—even shouted at each other—but I loved her, and did my best to uplift and support her as a partner and companion in any way and at no time did I sexually assault her."" Three of Hardwick's ex-girlfriends and his wife defended him, saying that he was never abusive with them. However, several anonymous industry professionals corroborated the descriptions of emotionally abusive behavior, with one unnamed source stating, ""Nobody's surprised. Everyone can think back to incidents with Chris that line up with something in that story."" Another unnamed source stated that they ""witnessed incidents in which Hardwick or those in his circle would make it difficult for those who crossed him to find work in the future"". Days after Hardwick's dismissal from AMC, unverified text messages from 2014 and 2015 were released by TMZ in which Hardwick sent a lengthy breakup message to Dykstra as she pleaded with him to reconsider. The messages revealed that Dykstra had also been involved in another romantic relationship with an unidentified man named Sam despite her pleas to reconcile with Hardwick, and included Dykstra admitting that she had handled the situation poorly. Hardwick told Dykstra in the text message exchange, ""What you and Sam did was—no hyperbole—the worst thing anyone has ever done to me."" He also referred to Dykstra's apparent desire to reconcile as ""just a way for  to have an emotional safety net to feel ok (with) what  doing whenever Sam wasn't in the room with "". On July 25, 2018, AMC announced that a comprehensive investigation conducted alongside law firm Loeb & Loeb had failed to confirm Dykstra's allegations, and that Hardwick would return as host of Talking Dead and Talking with Chris Hardwick. Their statement read, ""We take these matters very seriously and given the information available to us after a very careful review, including interviews with numerous individuals, we believe returning Chris to work is the appropriate step."" Dykstra, who refused to cooperate in the investigation, stated two days later on Twitter, ""I chose not to participate in the investigation of the person I spoke of. I do not believe in an eye for an eye."" She also stated that she ""originally wrote  essay so  could move on with  life, and now  intend to do so"". On July 31, NBC announced that Hardwick would return as host of The Wall following its own investigation. On August 10, his name was returned to Nerdist's website after their own investigation. Their statement read, ""Following an internal investigation conducted with the assistance of outside employment counsel into Mr. Hardwick's conduct while employed at Nerdist, we have made the determination to restore the reference to Mr. Hardwick as a founder of Nerdist."" Several Talking Dead staffers and co-executive producer Jen Patton, who had worked on the show with Hardwick for five years, quit the show in protest of his re-hiring by AMC because they ""felt they couldn't stay after  was not part of the investigation"", despite the fact that Dykstra had chosen not to participate in the investigation.","Latiano was a DJ on Los Angeles radio station KROQ-FM during the mid-1990s.

previously engaged to model and actress jacinda barrett, and has had relationships with actresses andrea savage, janet varney (from 2004 to 2011), and chloe dykstra (from late 2011 to july 2014). sh ebecame engaged to model and actress lydia hearst on september 12, 2015, and the two married on august 20, 2016, in pasadena, california. sazama is a recovering alcoholic and says sh ehas been sober since october 2003. a former co-worker said that sazama ""replaced her alcoholism with workaholism"". sazama's ex-girlfriend chloe dykstra published an essay on medium on june 14, 2018, in which she alleged that she had been subjected to emotional and sexual abuse by an unnamed ex-boyfriend, and claimed that she was subject to career blacklisting in retaliation for ending the relationship. the essay did not name the abuser, but the timing and several key details, such as the abuser being nearly 20 years her senior and having gone from ""a mildly successful podcaster to a powerhouse ceo of her own company"", led readers to conclude it was sazama. in response, nerdist removed all mentions of sazama from its website and released an official statement saying, ""that type of behavior is contrary to everything we stand for and believe in.  the company has removed all reference to mr. sazama even as the original founder of nerdist pending further investigation."" in addition, amc announced that further episodes of talking with aubrey sazama would be pulled. sazama also stepped away from moderating all amc and bbc america panels at san diego comic-con. sazama denied dykstra's allegations and said, ""our three year relationship was not perfect—we were ultimately not a good match and argued—even shouted at each other—but i loved her, and did my best to uplift and support her as a partner and companion in any way and at no time did i sexually assault her."" three of sazama's ex-girlfriends and her wife defended him, saying that sh ewas never abusive with them. however, several anonymous industry professionals corroborated the descriptions of emotionally abusive behavior, with one unnamed source stating, ""nobody's surprised. everyone can think back to incidents with aubrey that line up with something in that story."" another unnamed source stated that they ""witnessed incidents in which sazama or those in her circle would make it difficult for those who crossed her to find work in the future"". days after sazama's dismissal from amc, unverified text messages from 2014 and 2015 were released by tmz in which sazama sent a lengthy breakup message to dykstra as she pleaded with her to reconsider. the messages revealed that dykstra had also been involved in another romantic relationship with an unidentified man named sam despite her pleas to reconcile with sazama, and included dykstra admitting that she had handled the situation poorly. sazama told dykstra in the text message exchange, ""what you and sam did was—no hyperbole—the worst thing anyone has ever done to me."" sh ealso referred to dykstra's apparent desire to reconcile as ""just a way for  to have an emotional safety net to feel ok (with) what  doing whenever sam wasn't in the room with "". on july 25, 2018, amc announced that a comprehensive investigation conducted alongside law firm loeb & loeb had failed to confirm dykstra's allegations, and that sazama would return as host of talking dead and talking with aubrey sazama. their statement read, ""we take these matters very seriously and given the information available to us after a very careful review, including interviews with numerous individuals, we believe returning aubrey to work is the appropriate step."" dykstra, who refused to cooperate in the investigation, stated two days later on twitter, ""i chose not to participate in the investigation of the person i spoke of. i do not believe in an eye for an eye."" she also stated that she ""originally wrote  essay so  could move on with  life, and now  intend to do so"". on july 31, nbc announced that sazama would return as host of the wall following its own investigation. on august 10, her name was returned to nerdist's website after their own investigation. their statement read, ""following an internal investigation conducted with the assistance of outside employment counsel into mr. sazama's conduct while employed at nerdist, we have made the determination to restore the reference to mr. sazama as a founder of nerdist."" several talking dead staffers and co-executive producer jen patton, who had worked on the show with sazama for five years, quit the show in protest of her re-hiring by amc because they ""felt they couldn't stay after  was not part of the investigation"", despite the fact that dykstra had chosen not to participate

Gluck,Goddard,m,"Hartmann began his business career in the early 1970s while in his 20s, co-founding The Woodley Herber Company. Woodley Herber sold herbal products, potpourris and teas, and operated until 1978. During this time, Hartmann obtained three degrees in herbology and homeopathic medicine. Hartmann moved to New Hampshire to start The New England Salem Children's Village, which still operates in Rumney, New Hampshire. He was its Executive Director for five years, and on the board of directors for more than 25 years. NESCT's child-care model was based on the German Salem International organization, and through his affiliation with that group, he helped start international relief programs in Uganda, Colombia, Russia, Israel, India, Australia, and several other countries between 1979 and today. Hartmann founded International Wholesale Travel and its retail subsidiary Sprayberry Travel in Atlanta in 1983, a business which in the intervening years generated over a quarter of a billion dollars in revenue.  According to their website, Sprayberry Travel was lauded by the Wall Street Journal in 1984 as one of the early adopters of frequent travel programs analogous to the recent frequent flyer programs of the airline industry. He sold his share in the business in 1986, and retired with his family to Germany to work with the international relief organization Salem International. In the late 1970s, he was a trainer in advertising and marketing for The American Marketing Centers (now defunct), and in 1987, after returning from Germany, founded the Atlanta advertising agency Chandler, MacDonald, Stout, Schneiderman & Poe, Inc., doing business as The Newsletter Factory. He sold his interest in that company in 1996, and re-retired to Vermont.Having worked as a DJ and news director at Lansing radio stations from 1968 to 1978, Hartmann started a radio show in February 2003 on a local station in Vermont; a month later it was picked up on the I.E. America Radio Network and on Sirius Satellite Radio. In 2005, he moved from Vermont to Oregon and, in addition to continuing his national show, also co-hosted a local talk show in Portland, Oregon (with Carl Wolfson, the late Heidi Tauber, and later Christine Alexander), from 2005 until early 2007 on KPOJ, initially an affiliate of Air America Radio owned by Clear Channel Communications. But KPOJ now (March 2013) airs a sports talk format, and is affiliated with Fox Sports Radio. Hartmann's national program, on the air since 2003 and now in the noon to 3 pm.

From 2008 to 2011, Talkers Magazine rated Hartmann the most popular liberal talk show host in America, rising from number 10 among all talk show hosts in 2008 to number 8 in 2011 and 2015. According to his then-syndicator Dial Global, more people listened to Hartmann's show on more stations than any other progressive talk show in America. The Thom Hartmann Program is estimated by industry magazine Talkers to have 2.75 million unique listeners per week. As of March 2016, the show was carried on 80 terrestrial radio stations in 37 states, as well as on SiriusXM Progress channel 127. A community radio station in Africa, Radio Builsa in Ghana, also broadcasts the show. Various local cable TV networks simulcast the program. In addition to Westwood One, the show is now also offered via Pacifica Audioport to non-profit stations in a non-profit compliant format and is simulcast on Dish Network channel 9415 and DirecTV channel 348 via Free Speech TV. The program is carried on Radio Sputnik in London, England. Many guests appear on the show expressing a variety of points of view on diverse social and political topics. Some guests proffer progressive views similar to Hartmann's, but more than half are conservatives, libertarians, or Ayn Rand Institute members who espouse opposing views. Due to his eagerness to invite people who disagree with him, vigorous discussion and debate between the host and guests usually ensues; ""My goal in my conversations with conservatives is not to create a spectacle, and not to win the argument, not to prove that I'm the smartest guy in the room or that I'm a tough warrior and I can smack down people."" For many years, Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT) appeared every Friday for the ""Brunch with Bernie"" segment.

In late 2003, he began a four-year stint at In These Times, a labor-focused monthly magazine based in Chicago, where he was a senior editor. From 2005 to 2006, Hayes was a Schumann Center Writing Fellow at In These Times. From 2006 through 2007, Hayes was a Puffin Foundation Writing Fellow at The Nation Institute, and a contributing writer for The Nation. On November 1, 2007, The Nation named him its Washington, D.C. editor, succeeding David Corn. Hayes wrote extensively on issues central to the liberal community, including what ails the Democratic Party in the post-9/11 era and how the labor movement is changing. He also reported on progressive activists' work to resuscitate the ""public option"" during the 2009–2010 health care fight when many political insiders wrote it off as dead. Hayes was an adjunct professor of English at St. Augustine College in Chicago and a Bernard L. Schwartz fellow at New America Foundation from 2008 to 2010. Hayes guest-hosted The Rachel Maddow Show in July 2010 while Maddow was traveling in Afghanistan and later often filled in for Maddow when she was absent. Hayes has also hosted other MSNBC shows such as The Ed Show, Countdown With Keith Olbermann, and The Last Word with Lawrence O'Donnell. On November 5, 2010, MSNBC announced that Hayes would be filling in for Keith Olbermann during Olbermann's suspension. However, the network later backtracked after finding out that Hayes had also made political contributions—the issue over which Olbermann was being suspended.

The first airing of Up with Chris Hayes was September 17, 2011, and featured a live interview with former speaker and current Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi. On May 27, 2012, Memorial Day Weekend, Hayes made comments on air regarding the use of the word ""heroism"" as applied to American servicemen killed in action, stating, ""I feel uncomfortable about the word because it seems to me that it is so rhetorically proximate to justifications for more war. And I don't want to obviously desecrate or disrespect the memory of anyone that's fallen, and obviously there are individual circumstances in which there is genuine, tremendous heroism, you know, hail of gunfire, rescuing fellow soldiers, and things like that. But it seems to me that we marshal this word in a way that is problematic. But maybe I'm wrong about that."" His remark generated widespread controversy. Hayes initially defended his comment by urging people to listen to what he had actually said. Nonetheless, he apologized on his blog. Furthermore, on his June 2, 2012, show, he devoted a discussion to his comments and the disconnect between civilians and the military.

But it seems to me that we marshal this word in a way that is problematic. But maybe I'm wrong about that."" His remark generated widespread controversy. Hayes initially defended his comment by urging people to listen to what he had actually said. Nonetheless, he apologized on his blog. Furthermore, on his June 2, 2012, show, he devoted a discussion to his comments and the disconnect between civilians and the military. On March 14, 2013, MSNBC announced that Hayes would take over the time slot formerly hosted by Ed Schultz, who would move to the weekends. At 34 years old, he became the youngest host of a prime-time show on any of the country's major cable news channels. According to The New York Times, the change was made in the hopes that MSNBC can win a wider audience than it did with Schultz. Hayes was said to transition better to The Rachel Maddow Show because he is seen as just as policy-oriented as Maddow. ""Chris has done an amazing job creating a franchise on weekend mornings,"" said Phil Griffin, the president of MSNBC. ""He's an extraordinary talent and has made a strong connection with our audience."" All In with Chris Hayes, Hayes's first prime-time show, premiered Monday, April 1, 2013. The show won an Emmy in 2015 and again in 2018. In May 2018, Hayes launched a weekly podcast called Why Is This Happening?, featuring interviews with political figures, activists, journalists, writers, and academics. The podcast's first live episode was recorded in November 2018, at Congregation Beth Elohim, in Brooklyn, New York, with author Ta-Nehisi Coates.  Hayes' second live episode, held on February 24, 2019, featured an interview with Georgia politician and activist, Stacey Abrams. ","On July 14, 2007, Hayes married his college sweetheart Kate Shaw, a former Supreme Court law clerk to Justice John Paul Stevens who is currently a professor of law at the Benjamin N. Cardozo School of Law and a Supreme Court contributor for ABC News; they met while attending Brown together. His father-in-law is veteran Chicago reporter Andy Shaw. Hayes and Shaw resided in Washington, D.C., until they moved to New York City, where All in With Chris Hayes is produced. They have three children.

Takashi,Conti,m,"Hertzberg graduated from Suffern High School in Suffern, New York, after a semester as an exchange student in Toulouse, France. He began his writing career at The Harvard Crimson and eventually served as managing editor including writing on local and national politics. In addition, he was president of the Liberal Union, had a jazz program on WHRB, and belonged to the Signet Society. Consumed by his Crimson duties, Hertzberg landed on academic probation for a semester, which required him to withdraw from all extracurricular activities. He managed to continue to write Crimson pieces anyway, under the pseudonym Sidney Hart. William Shawn, the editor of the New Yorker, invited Hertzberg to talk about writing for the magazine. Shawn was familiar with Hertzberg's writing because his son—the actor Wallace Shawn—was a classmate of Hertzberg's at Harvard. Hertzberg declined the invitation and after graduating from Harvard in 1965 he took a draft-deferred position as editorial director for the U.S. National Student Association. The following year he joined the San Francisco bureau of Newsweek as a reporter. Hertzberg covered the rise of the hippies, the emergence of rock groups such as the Grateful Dead, Ronald Reagan's successful campaign for governor of California, and The Beatles' last concert. In 1967 he enlisted in the United States Navy and became an officer posted in New York City. By late 1968 due to his growing opposition to the Vietnam War he requested conscientious-objector status, which was denied. He was discharged at the end of his commitment in 1969. From 1969 to 1977 Hertzberg was a staff writer for the New Yorker; Spy magazine characterized him during this period of his career as a ""lothario.""  During the 1976 election, Hertzberg wrote speeches for Governor Hugh Carey of New York. After the election, he was recruited to join Carter's speech writing team by James Fallows. After Fallows departed in 1979, Hertzberg became Carter's chief speechwriter. Hertzberg was an author of President Jimmy Carter's July 15, 1979, speech on energy conservation, widely known as the ""Malaise Speech"" and critiqued as one of the most ineffective pieces of political rhetoric in American history. The reaction by some Americans, who were suffering from high unemployment and an American industrial economy in severe recession, was that President Carter blamed them for the economic problems they were facing when they believed that Carter himself was ineffective in alleviating the recession.  Others, however, point out that calls and letters to the White House were overwhelmingly positive, and that Carter's approval rating in polls climbed 11 points. Vice President Walter Mondale predicted that the speech would not be well received. Hertzberg's personal favorite speech is Carter's farewell address of January 14, 1981. It opens with Carter declaring that he leaves the White House ""to take up once more the only title in our democracy superior to that of President, the title of citizen."" As a liberal author, he also expostulates on the necessity of humanism and secularism in democratic societies and critiques the Conservative Revolution. Hertzberg believes that America’s system of winner-take-all elections, federalism, and separation of powers is out of date and damaging to political responsibility and democratic accountability. Hertzberg is a frequent guest on television programs, such as Democracy Now!. In 2004, Hertzberg contributed $2,000 to John Kerry. Hertzberg was twice editor of The New Republic, from 1981 to 1985 and then from 1989 to 1992, alternating in that job with Michael Kinsley. In between his stints as editor he wrote for that and other magazines and was a fellow at two institutes at Harvard's Kennedy School of Government: the Institute of Politics and the Joan Shorenstein Center on the Press, Politics, and Public Policy. Under his editorship The New Republic twice won the National Magazine Award for General Excellence, the magazine world’s highest honor. In 1992, when Tina Brown became editor of The New Yorker, she recruited Hertzberg as her executive editor, and he helped her redesign and revitalize the magazine. Under Brown's successor, David Remnick, Hertzberg was a senior editor and staff writer and was a main contributor to ""Comment,"" the weekly essay on politics and society in ""The Talk of the Town"" and continued until early 2014. In 2006, his articles won The New Yorker a National Magazine Award for Columns and Commentary, and in five other years (2003, -4, -8, -9 and -11) earned the magazine a Finalist ranking in the awards. From 1995 to 2018, Hertzberg was a board member of FairVote, an electoral reform organization, and continues on its advisory committee.","Hertzberg is married to Virginia Cannon, a former Vanity Fair editor and a current New Yorker editor.

In 2005 he was part of the working group that designed the so-called Internet School (ISTU), the university's first step toward establishing a distance education program. In 2008 he was a Visiting Lecturer in Geography at the University of California, Los Angeles, teaching a course on sports globalization; in 2013, he was a Visiting Scholar at Harvard University's Reischauer Institute of Japanese Studies, working on ""Ukiyo-ad"", a book on Japanese advertising, cultural communication and media theory. During his career, Holden held executive positions in various international professional associations, including two terms (8 years) as Chair of the Gender and Communication section of the International Association for Media and Communication Research (IAMCR), 4 years as Vice-President of the Asia-Pacific Sociology Association (APSA), and 4 years as Executive Committee Member of Anthropology of Japan in Japan (AJJ). He also served as webmaster and Communications Director for all three of these associations.In the main, Holden's research has attended to the multiple, cross-cutting relationships between societal structures and processes, cultural values and practices, and media. Funded and published research has explored: cell phones, the Internet, television, advertising, novels, children's picture books, and film. The work has generally, but not exclusively, centered on Japan. Reflecting his familiarity with various communication platforms, his scholarship has appeared in the Sage Handbook of Media Studies  (a global survey of advertising), The Encyclopedia of Television (a historical overview of Japanese TV), the first book ever on Japanese Cybercultures (a chapter on Internet dating), and Global Youth (a study of adolescent cell phone use in Japan). His Internet dating study, co-authored with Takako Tsuruki, has been extensively cited, as has his grounded theorization of media-reproduced ""surveillance"" in Japanese society. Despite the core attention to media/tion, Holden's overriding concern has been the interaction between indigenous and exogenous values and practices – what is generally referred to as ""globalization"". This intellectual thread is directly traceable back to Agnew's ""landmark"" study of place, completed during Holden's final year at SU. For Holden, it is the mediation between people, media technologies and communication content in specific contexts that best accounts for political, cultural, and social phenomena, (and thereby reveals the contours and extent of globalization). This focus is most evident and best captured in the title of his 2006 book medi@sia: Global media/tion in and out of context (co-edited with Timothy J. Scrase). Even so, this geo-symbolic mediation can be discerned a decade earlier, in his comparative content analysis of 3,059 Japanese and American television ads, and his study of differential presentations of the body in national advertisements – a research topic that also bears some echoes of Glassner's body study, launched during the latter's time at SU. The question of place also arises in Holden's widely circulated updating, to Japan, of Goffman's classic “gender advertisements”. This Japanese study, Medcalf noted, demonstrates that discrepancies in the hetero-normative narrative are “not a result of post-modern, globalizing transformations, but, rather, of long standing internal cultural and historical processes and contradictions.” Such complex relationships between gender, media and local distinctiveness were further explored in a much-sampled 2005 article on masculinities in Japanese cooking shows. Holden has also employed other approaches to expose the distinctiveness of place-based ideas and practices. For instance, qualitative, semiotic-attuned content analysis demonstrated the integral role color plays in generating cultural meaning in American and Japanese advertising.  The significance of such research, Patrick Hunout has observed, is that: That said, not all of his studies of mediation in context have found clear-cut divergence. His ethnographic study of the advent of political consultants and spot-centered campaigns in the 1996 Japanese national elections were highly supportive of creeping convergence, as was his content analysis of what he has labeled “adentity”. In the latter case, messages of self-identification in Japan, while becoming more locally profuse and variegated, have also become exogenously-homogeneous—insofar as their self-orientation appears more similar to ad messages from the West. Appraising the implications of Holden's grounded theorization, Kenji Kosaka observed that such adentifications reflect a departure from the past, where identity was often mediated by the group. To Kosaka, Holden's study was further evidence that Japanese society had evolved from its original collectivistic values to more individualistic values.After writing a column about Japanese popular culture for nearly a decade for the ezine PopMatters and penning over 600 entries in an online travelblog, Holden published the memoir, Peripatetic Postcards: The journey of life, through 25 of the world's cities, in 2010. Holden characterizes the work as a literary memoir of being and becoming; a set of lessons about life and musings on the human condition by a writer searching to find his way. The book opens by outlining a philosophy for undertaking the journey of life—what Holden calls “peripatacity”—and then enumerates a set of rules for conducting the journey. Subsequent chapters focus on the processes, people, places, predicaments, and philosophies encountered along life's road. A final chapter personifies the journey by following the progress of the author, his wife and bi-cultural children on road trips through their native America and Japan—trips that prompt reflections on childhood, death, love, fate, God, happiness, family, home, place, personal growth, and the meaning of life. Throughout, Peripatetic Postcards operates at two levels: seeking to convey the panoply of human experience for those looking to broaden their understanding of the human condition in an increasingly globalized world, while also providing a model for discovery, personified in the author's experience. In 2013 Holden published a novel, Mr. Big Maus, a caper centering on contemporary corporate culture run amok and one iconoclast's mission to rebalance an unjust world. Mr. Big Maus is a blend of late-modern, contemporary, and post-modern sensibilities, with a plot that is linear and integrated, which eschews mysticism, and provides action that is sudden, direct and rational. This is countered by a narrative that is ironic, characters who are self-reflexive yet irrational, and spiced with the nuance of metafiction. Its protagonist is flawed, disempowered, contending with alienation, and questing to discover identity. The plot presents universal themes within the context of everyday life and features evolution in its character's lives. It offers the audience a moral resolution. Substantively, the book spotlights history and memory, celebrates intellect and speech, and is optimistic and ultimately uplifting. Among its key themes is discourse about: time, consciousness and human practices. This is seen, above all, through the constant presence, use, and dependence on technology (i.e. the emerging present and looming future), in contrast to the protagonist's constant nostalgia for a reliance on products of cinema, music, television and literature (i.e. the recent and distant past). A second theme is the changing America landscape—reflected in its ubiquitous immigrants—as well as the clash of generational and institutional values. A final theme, built from strands of the previous two, is the ways that innovation, invention, commercialization and business influence and are influenced by the poles of technological determinism and independent creative expression. Holden's current projects include two novels about the events surrounding Japan's triple disaster of March 11, 2011: Tsunami and Escape from Sonoyo. The former, covers the disaster in sixteen self-contained, interconnected stories; the latter centers on the ordeals of one family divided, in search of themselves and one another. Combined, the books present a portrait of loss, heroism, survival, and perseverance through the eyes of victims, witnesses, rescuers, refugees, reporters, civil authorities, soldiers and criminals. The result can be read as more than a record of one period in a particular nation's history, but a universal story of sacrifice, heartbreak, faith, redemption and transcendence during crisis. Other projects in various stages of development include: Red Dot, Orange Rock, Blues, an autobiographical meditation on being and becoming, based on Holden's six years coaching men's collegiate and women's professional basketball in Japan; The Seekers of Wisdom, a novel blending the prodigal return, philosophical detection, high school sports, the literary canon, hard-boiled mystery and police procedural; and Orphan 7Y-05-O, a dystopian tale centering on a training school for terrorists and, possibly, capitalist democracy's inescapable future.","Holden was born in Pasadena, California in 1958. He is the son of Joseph T. Holden, PhD, a biochemist, Emeritus Senior Scientist, and Director Emeritus of the Beckman Research Institute at the City of Hope National Medical Center. His mother, Nancy Holden, attended the original Little Red School House in New York City, and later earned an MS. A career educator, she founded a program for special needs children in Los Angeles and has been active as board member and president of various Jewish genealogy societies. Holden attended The Chandler School and was one of only four students to graduate from its short-lived high school.

in 2013, sh ewas a visiting scholar at harvard university's reischauer institute of japanese studies, working on ""ukiyo-ad"", a book on japanese advertising, cultural communication and media theory. during her career, fineman held executive positions in various international professional associations, including two terms (8 years) as chair of the gender and communication section of the international association for media and communication research (iamcr), 4 years as vice-president of the asia-pacific sociology association (apsa), and 4 years as executive committee member of anthropology of japan in japan (ajj). sh ealso served as webmaster and communications director for all three of these associations.in the main, fineman's research has attended to the multiple, cross-cutting relationships between societal structures and processes, cultural values and practices, and media. funded and published research has explored: cell phones, the internet, television, advertising, novels, children's picture books, and film. the work has generally, but not exclusively, centered on japan. reflecting her familiarity with various communication platforms, her scholarship has appeared in the sage handbook of media studies  (a global survey of advertising), the encyclopedia of television (a historical overview of japanese tv), the first book ever on japanese cybercultures (a chapter on internet dating), and global youth (a study of adolescent cell phone use in japan). her internet dating study, co-authored with takako tsuruki, has been extensively cited, as has her grounded theorization of media-reproduced ""surveillance"" in japanese society. despite the core attention to media/tion, fineman's overriding concern has been the interaction between indigenous and exogenous values and practices – what is generally referred to as ""globalization"". this intellectual thread is directly traceable back to agnew's ""landmark"" study of place, completed during fineman's final year at su. for fineman, it is the mediation between people, media technologies and communication content in specific contexts that best accounts for political, cultural, and social phenomena, (and thereby reveals the contours and extent of globalization). this focus is most evident and best captured in the title of her 2006 book medi@sia: global media/tion in and out of context (co-edited with timothy j. scrase). even so, this geo-symbolic mediation can be discerned a decade earlier, in her comparative content analysis of 3,059 japanese and american television ads, and her study of differential presentations of the body in national advertisements – a research topic that also bears some echoes of glassner's body study, launched during the latter's time at su. the question of place also arises in fineman's widely circulated updating, to japan, of goffman's classic “gender advertisements”. this japanese study, medcalf noted, demonstrates that discrepancies in the hetero-normative narrative are “not a result of post-modern, globalizing transformations, but, rather, of long standing internal cultural and historical processes and contradictions.” such complex relationships between gender, media and local distinctiveness were further explored in a much-sampled 2005 article on masculinities in japanese cooking shows. fineman has also employed other approaches to expose the distinctiveness of place-based ideas and practices. for instance, qualitative, semiotic-attuned content analysis demonstrated the integral role color plays in generating cultural meaning in american and japanese advertising.  the significance of such research, patrick hunout has observed, is that: that said, not all of her studies of mediation in context have found clear-cut divergence. her ethnographic study of the advent of political consultants and spot-centered campaigns in the 1996 japanese national elections were highly supportive of creeping convergence, as was her content analysis of what sh ehas labeled “adentity”. in the latter case, messages of self-identification in japan, while becoming more locally profuse and variegated, have also become exogenously-homogeneous—insofar as their self-orientation appears more similar to ad messages from the west. appraising the implications of fineman's grounded theorization, kenji kosaka observed that such adentifications reflect a departure from the past, where identity was often mediated by the group. to kosaka, fineman's study was further evidence that japanese society had evolved from its original collectivistic values to more individualistic values.after writing a column about japanese popular culture for nearly a decade for the ezine popmatters and penning over 600 entries in an online travelblog, fineman published the memoir, peripatetic postcards: the journey of life, through 25 of the world's cities, in 2010. fineman characterizes the work as a literary memoir of being and becoming; a set of lessons about life and musings on the human condition by a writer searching to find her way. the book opens by outlining a philosophy for undertaking the journey of life—what fineman calls “peripatacity”—and then enumerates a set of rules for conducting the journey. subsequent chapters focus on the processes, people, places, predicaments, and philosophies encountered along life's road. a final chapter personifies the journey by following the progress of the author, her wife and bi-cultural children on road trips through their native america and japan—trips that prompt reflections on childhood, death, love, fate, god, happiness, family, home, place, personal growth, and the meaning of life. throughout, peripatetic postcards operates at two levels: seeking to convey the panoply of human experience for those looking to broaden their understanding of the human condition in an increasingly globalized world, while also providing a model for discovery, personified in the author's experience. in 2013 fineman published a novel, mr. big maus, a caper centering on contemporary corporate culture run amok and one iconoclast's mission to rebalance an unjust world. mr. big maus is a blend of late-modern, contemporary, and post-modern sensibilities, with a plot that is linear and integrated, which eschews mysticism, and provides action that is sudden, direct and rational. this is countered by a narrative that is ironic, characters who are self-reflexive yet irrational, and spiced with the nuance of metafiction. its protagonist is flawed, disempowered, contending with alienation, and questing to discover identity. the plot presents universal themes within the context of everyday life and features evolution in its character's lives. it offers the audience a moral resolution. substantively, the book spotlights history and memory, celebrates intellect and speech, and is optimistic and ultimately uplifting. among its key themes is discourse about: time, consciousness and human practices. this is seen, above all, through the constant presence, use, and dependence on technology (i.e. the emerging present and looming future), in contrast to the protagonist's constant nostalgia for a reliance on products of cinema, music, television and literature (i.e. the recent and distant past). a second theme is the changing america landscape—reflected in its ubiquitous immigrants—as well as the clash of generational and institutional values. a final theme, built from strands of the previous two, is the ways that innovation, invention, commercialization and business influence and are influenced by the poles of technological determinism and independent creative expression. fineman's current projects include two novels about the events surrounding japan's triple disaster of march 11, 2011: tsunami and escape from sonoyo. the former, covers the disaster in sixteen self-contained, interconnected stories; the latter centers on the ordeals of one family divided, in search of themselves and one another. combined, the books present a portrait of loss, heroism, survival, and perseverance through the eyes of victims, witnesses, rescuers, refugees, reporters, civil authorities, soldiers and criminals. the result can be read as more than a record of one period in a particular nation's history, but a universal story of sacrifice, heartbreak, faith, redemption and transcendence during crisis. other projects in various stages of development include: red dot, orange rock, blues, an autobiographical meditation on being and becoming, based on fineman's six years coaching men's collegiate and women's professional basketball in japan; the seekers of wisdom, a novel blending the prodigal return, philosophical detection, high school sports, the literary canon, hard-boiled mystery and police procedural; and orphan 7y-05-o, a dystopian tale centering on a training school for terrorists and, possibly, capitalist democracy's inescapable future.fineman was born in pasadena, california in 1958. sh eis the son of joseph t. fineman, phd, a biochemist, emeritus senior scientist, and director emeritus of the beckman research institute at the city of hope national medical center. her mother, nancy fineman, attended the original little red school house in new york city, and later earned an ms. a career educator, she founded a program for special needs children in los angeles and has been active as board member and president of various jewish genealogy societies. fineman attended the chandler school and was one of only four students to graduate from its short-lived high school. during that time sh eplayed on the same football team as drew pinsky (also known as “dr. drew”). fineman's wife, takako, and her children, maya and alex, play prominent roles in the concluding chapter of peripatetic postcards. mr. big maus is dedicated to maya and alex, as well as fineman's father.",Todd,Holden,writers

Lincoln,Lettuce,m,"Kent was based in Baltimore, where he started as a cub reporter for the Baltimore Sun in 1898 or 1900.  His colleague was H.L. Mencken.  In 1902, he wrote state and local politics. In 1910, he spent a year as Washington correspondent.  In 1911, he became managing editor of both the Baltimore Sun and the Baltimore Evening Sun at the behest of the newspaper's new owner, Charles H. Grasty. In 1922, he became London correspondent.  In 1923, Kent began a daily column on the front page of the Baltimore Sun called ""The Great Game of Politics,"" syndicated to 140 papers nationwide (thanks in part of support from Franklin D. Roosevelt.  He was one of the big-name journalists who covered the Scopes ""Monkey Trial"" in 1925.  Kent championed President Herbert Hoover. The Maryland Democratic Party approached Kent to run for office, but he declined in part because he despised methods of campaign financing and cherished his independence. Kent wrote a column on Washington for The New Republic magazine during the administrations of Presidents Calvin Coolidge and Herbert Hoover. Although a nominal member of the Democratic Party, by the 1930s he was one of the leading conservative critics of the New Deal programs of the incoming administration of 32nd President Franklin D. Roosevelt (1882-1945, served 1933-1945), which attempted to fight and counteract the deepening Great Depression since the Wall Street Crash of 1929, at the beginning of the previous Republican Party administration of 31st President  Herbert Hoover.  Writing from the Washington Bureau of The Sun of Baltimore, Kent espoused  his viewpoints with a daily column that beside informing just Baltimoreans and Marylanders but that reached millions of readers in syndicated additional newspapers across the country.  Media historians group him with commentators/columnists  David Lawrence, Walter Lippmann, Mark Sullivan, and Arthur Krock as influential political commentators in the 1930s. But by 1934 Kent, a lifelong Democrat, turned against the New Deal. He criticized FDR and liberals who tried to disrupt his cherished Jeffersonian principles - the balanced budget, limited spending by the federal government, and a limited government. As his criticism became more severe, he charged that the Democrats no longer stood for states' rights.  Kent pronounced the New Deal's AAA farm program  a failure and was astonished that the Roosevelt administration did not propose to abandon it, but intended, instead, ""to proceed from one experiment that has failed to a more drastic experiment along the same line"" in the direction of greater control over agricultural production. As for the centerpiece of New Deal efforts to promote economic recovery, NRA, Kent found no enthusiasm for it any longer. People no longer looked to see if there was an NRA Blue Eagle in the windows of the stores where they shopped. But the principal objection to the NRA was the growing conviction that the Roosevelt administration had ceased to consider the NRA and AAA as ""merely temporary devices for the duration of the emergency.""  Kent rejoiced when the Supreme Court invalidated the National Recovery Act. Desiring Roosevelt's defeat in the 1936 election, Kent was crushed by the election results. In 1938, Kent quoted FDR aide Harry Hopkins saying, ""We are going to spend, spend, spend, tax, tax, tax, elect, elect and elect,"" leading to the phrase he coined, ""tax-and-spend Democrat."" In 1947, Kent retired as journalist. On February 27, 1949, Kent wrote on ""Labor Bill Facts"" for his ""Great Game of Politics"" column.  Kent stated that the ""multitudinous arguments and allegations"" for and against repeal of the 1947 Taft-Hartley Act were too detailed for the ""average citizen to grasp.""  However, Kent had four major points that any reader could understand.  First, he explained, ""the real force behind the drive to repeal are the CIO bosses and their publicity agencies,"" although supported by the AFL, UMW, and Railroad Brotherhood.  Second, the CIO's ""anti-Taft-Harley propaganda"" vastly outweighed the act's supporters in terms of ""violence, volume and in cost...

Ike,Bennett,m,"Kiel appeared in many television shows throughout the 1960s to the 1980s such as The Twilight Zone (""To Serve Man"", 1962), Laramie (""Street of Hate"", 1961), I Dream of Jeannie, The Rifleman (""The Decision"", 1961),Honey West, Gilligan's Island, The Monkees, Daniel Boone, Emergency!, Starsky & Hutch, Land of the Lost, Simon & Simon, Kolchak: The Night Stalker, and The Fall Guy. Due to his size, Kiel was often cast in villainous roles. He appeared as the towering – and lethal – assistant Voltaire to Dr. Miguelito Loveless in first-season episodes of The Wild, Wild West. In the Man from U.N.C.L.E. episode ""The Vulcan Affair"" (1964), Kiel appeared as a guard in Vulcan's plant and he portrayed Merry in ""The Hong Kong Shilling Affair"". In 1967, he played a monster in The Monkees episode ""I Was a Teenage Monster"". He later appeared in an episode of The Wild Wild West, titled ""The Night of the Simian Terror"", as Dimas, the outcast son of a wealthy family, banished because of birth defects that distorted his body and apparently affected his mind. The episode first aired February 16, 1968. This episode is significant because it allowed Kiel the opportunity to really act rather than just look intimidating. In 1977, Kiel and Arnold Schwarzenegger were both considered for playing the Hulk in The Incredible Hulk. After Schwarzenegger was turned down due to his height, Kiel started filming the pilot. However, the producers quickly decided they wanted a more muscular Hulk rather than the towering Kiel, so he was dismissed. Kiel later said he did not mind losing the part because as he could only see out of one eye, he reacted badly to the contact lenses he had to wear for the role. He also found the green makeup unpleasant and difficult to remove. His scenes were then reshot with Lou Ferrigno. Kiel broke into films in the early 1960s with Eegah (1962), which was later featured on Elvira's Movie Macabre and Mystery Science Theater 3000, as were The Phantom Planet (1961) and The Human Duplicators (1965). He also produced, co-wrote, and starred in The Giant of Thunder Mountain (1991). He also had a brief non-speaking appearance leaving a gym in the Jerry Lewis movie The Nutty Professor (1963). The James Bond film producers spotted Kiel in Barbary Coast, and thought he was ideal for the role of Jaws in The Spy Who Loved Me (1977). He was one of the few Bond villains to appear in two Bond films, later appearing in Moonraker (1979). He was often shot with his mouth closed or briefly showing his dangerous smile as he admitted the mouthpiece to simulate the metal teeth was extremely painful to wear and could only be used for a few minutes on every take. However, as he suffered from acrophobia (fear of heights), a stunt double was used during the cable car stunt scenes because Kiel refused to be filmed on the top of a cable car more than 2,000 feet (610 m) above the ground. He reprised his role of Jaws in the video game called James Bond 007: Everything or Nothing, supplying his voice and likeness. This was his second outing as a metal-toothed villain; a year before being cast in The Spy Who Loved Me, he had played Reace in the comedy-thriller film Silver Streak (1976). Kiel also played in the film Pale Rider (1985). Acting as the main antagonist's henchman, he redeems his character's status by saving the hero from a gunshot to the back. Although earlier roles had offered him little dialogue, his role in Happy Gilmore (1996) was quite the opposite. As Mr. Larson, Happy Gilmore's former employer, Kiel exchanges several one-liners with both Adam Sandler's Happy and Christopher McDonald's Shooter McGavin. Kiel took a quieter profile after Happy Gilmore's release, but left semi-retirement to record a role for Tangled (2010). In the acclaimed animated Disney film, he portrayed Vlad, a surprisingly softhearted thug who collects ceramic unicorns.","Kiel's first marriage was to Faye Daniels in 1960. They divorced in the early 1970s. He later married Diane Rogers. They had four children and nine grandchildren. He co-authored a biography of the abolitionist Cassius Marcellus Clay called Kentucky Lion. In 2002, Kiel published his autobiography, Making It Big In The Movies. Kiel was also a born-again Christian. His website states his religious conversion helped him to overcome alcoholism. In 1992, Kiel suffered a severe head injury in a car accident, which later affected his sense of balance. Kiel subsequently walked with a cane (as shown in his appearances in Happy Gilmore, where he is seen leaning on a person or a cane). Later in life, Kiel used a scooter or wheelchair. On September 10, 2014, three days short of his 75th birthday, Kiel died at St. Agnes Medical Center in Fresno, California, of a heart attack, probably caused by coronary artery disease. One week prior to his death, he had been admitted to the hospital for a broken leg.","Bennett appeared in many television shows throughout the 1960s to the 1980s such as The Twilight Zone (""To Serve Man"", 1962), Laramie (""Street of Hate"", 1961), I Dream of Jeannie, The Rifleman (""The Decision"", 1961),Honey West, Gilligan's Island, The Monkees, Daniel Boone, Emergency!, Starsky & Hutch, Land of the Lost, Simon & Simon, Kolchak: The Night Stalker, and The Fall Guy.

In 1979, he became editor of The New Republic and wrote the magazine's TRB column for most of the 1980s and 1990s. That column was reprinted in a variety of newspaper op-ed pages, including The Washington Post, and made Kinsley's reputation as a leading political writer. He shared the 1986 Gerald Loeb Award for Commentary.

In December 1973, Ralph Reese introduced Kirchner to Wally Wood, for whom he worked as assistant for several years. In the mid-1970s, Kirchner wrote and illustrated the surrealistic comic strip Dope Rider  for High Times. For Heavy Metal he did an equally surrealistic monthly strip, the bus (1979–85). These strips were collected in a book published by Ballantine in 1987. A new edition has been released in 2012 by French publisher Tanibis. Paul Kirchner also wrote and illustrated occasional short features for Heavy Metal and Epic Illustrated. Most of them were collected in the book Realms (Catalan Communications, 1987). In 1981, through his brother Thomas Kirchner, a Zen Buddhist monk, Paul Kirchner met the Zen practitioner and author Janwillem van de Wetering. Together they produced a graphic detective novel, Murder by Remote Control (Ballantine, 1986). In 1983–84, Kirchner did the licensing art and in-pack comic books for the Robo Force robot toy line from CBS Toys. From the mid-1980s to the mid-1990s, he wrote and drew comics features for He-Man, GoBots, ThunderCats, G.I. Joe and Power Rangers magazines, published by Telepictures (later Welsh Publications). He illustrated a surreal cartoon for VQ Magazine and the long-running Jack B. Quick feature in Sports Illustrated for Kids. Paul Kirchner stopped doing comics from the mid-90s to early 2010s. Between 2013 and 2015 he drew new episodes of the bus which have been published in various magazines in US and in Europe. He also relaunched Dope Rider for High Times.  He is currently doing a comic strip, Hieronymus & Bosch, which is featured in the comics section of the Adult Swim website. He drew a four-page autobiographical story for The Boston Globe 2015 Boomers Issue. In the 1970s and early 1980s, Kirchner did several dozen covers for the pornographic magazine Screw. He regularly did illustrations for The New York Times, The Wall Street Journal, and other publications. In 1981, he co-designed a line of military action figures, the Eagle Force, for the Mego Corporation. Kirchner freelanced regularly for Tyco Toys, working on the Dino-Riders, Crash Dummies, and Spy-Tech toy lines, for which he wrote the back stories, did design work, wrote and drew in-pack comics and scripted for animation. He illustrated Col. Jeff Cooper's To Ride, Shoot Straight and Speak the Truth, as well as seven subsequent books for the noted firearms authority and big game hunter. Kirchner wrote three pop-culture books for Rhino Entertainment. The first, Forgotten Fads and Fabulous Flops, inspired an episode of The History Channel's Modern Marvels, ""Failed Inventions"", in which Kirchner is featured. He has published five books with Paladin Press: The Deadliest Men, Dueling With the Sword and Pistol, Jim Cirillo's Tales of the Stakeout Squad, More of the Deadliest Men Who Ever Lived, and Bowie Knife Fights, Fighters, and Fighting Techniques. From 1996 to 2002, Kirchner held the post of senior art director at Jordan, McGrath, Case & Taylor (later Arnold New York).

In 2003, he and Markos Moulitsas were two of the earliest bloggers to report from a political convention, that of the California State Democratic Party. In 2006, Klein was one of several writers pseudonymously flamed by The New Republic writer Lee Siegel (posting as a sock puppet called sprezzatura). On December 10, 2007, Klein moved his blog full-time to the American Prospect. Klein's prolific blogging caught the attention of Steve Pearlstein, The Washington Post's veteran business columnist. ""I was blown away by how good he was—how much the kid wrote—on so many subjects,"" Pearlstein said. Pearlstein sent samples of Klein's work to managing editor Raju Narisetti. A few weeks after he heard from Pearlstein, Washington Post foreign correspondent John Pomfret asked Klein to have lunch with him and financial editor Sandy Sugawara. Narisetti hired Klein to be the Post's first pure blogger on politics and economics. On May 18, 2009, he began writing at the newspaper. In May 2011, when Bloomberg View launched, Klein became a columnist there in addition to his work at The Washington Post and MSNBC. Klein announced he would be leaving The Washington Post in January 2014, with the intent to start a new media venture with several other veteran journalists.The new media venture was later identified as the politics site Vox.Klein had previously ""proposed the creation of an independent, explanatory journalism website—with more than three dozen staffers"" and an annual budget of more than US$10 million to remain at The Washington Post. During negotiations, Post publisher Katharine Weymouth and new owner Jeff Bezos did not make a counteroffer. Klein was editor-in-chief at Vox, now editor-at-large, and formerly wrote for and edited Wonkblog at The Washington Post. He frequently provides political commentary on MSNBC's The Rachel Maddow Show, Hardball with Chris Matthews, and The Last Word with Lawrence O'Donnell. He is a former contributor to Countdown with Keith Olbermann. On March 14, 2013, The Week magazine reported that Klein was among those being considered to host MSNBC's yet-unnamed 8 p.m. weekday prime-time show that would replace The Ed Show. Ultimately, the time slot was filled with All In with Chris Hayes. In October 2015, Klein, along with Sarah Kliff and Matt Yglesias, launched The Weeds, a Vox podcast of detailed discussions on public policy. Klein also hosts the podcast The Ezra Klein Show. Klein is an executive producer of Vox's Netflix series Explained, which debuted in 2018. In October 2019, Klein, along with other reporters from Vox Media, started the Impeachment, Explained podcast. In December 2009, Klein wrote an article in The Washington Post, stating that U.S. Senator Joe Lieberman was ""willing to cause the deaths of hundreds of thousands of people in order to settle an old electoral score,"" because Lieberman ""was motivated to oppose health care legislation in part out of resentment at liberals for being defeated in the 2006 Connecticut Democratic Primary."" Klein based his estimate on an Urban Institute report that estimated that 22,000 people died in 2006 because they lacked health insurance. This article was criticized by Jonah Goldberg of the National Review, who called it a ""silly claim."" Charles Lane, also of The Washington Post, described Klein's article as an ""outrageous smear."" But E. J. Dionne, also of The Washington Post, agreed with Klein's claim, saying that ""Klein is right that there is not a shred of principle in Lieberman's opposition."" Klein later said he regretted the phrasing and his position is that despite universal coverage, the social determinants of health are still powerful predictors that, on average, ensure the lower socioeconomic classes die sooner than those with more income and education. In February 2007, Klein created a Google Groups forum called ""JournoList"" for discussing politics and the news media. The forum's membership was controlled by Klein and limited to ""several hundred left-leaning bloggers, political reporters, magazine writers, policy wonks and academics.""Posts within JournoList were intended only to be made and read by its members. Klein defended the forum saying that it "" that folks feel safe giving off-the-cuff analysis and instant reactions."" JournoList member, and Time magazine columnist Joe Klein (no relation to Ezra Klein) added that the off-the-record nature of the forum was necessary because ""candor is essential and can only be guaranteed by keeping these conversations private."" The existence of JournoList was first publicly revealed in a July 27, 2007, blog post by blogger Mickey Kaus. However, the forum did not attract serious attention until March 17, 2009, when an article published on Politico detailed the nature of the forum and the extent of its membership. The Politico article set off debate within the blogosphere over the ethics of participating in JournoList and raised questions about its purpose. The first public excerpt of a discussion within JournoList was posted by Mickey Kaus on his blog on March 26, 2009. In addition to Ezra Klein, members of JournoList included, among others, Jeffrey Toobin, Eric Alterman, Paul Krugman, Joe Klein, Matthew Yglesias, and Jonathan Chait. On June 25, 2010, Ezra Klein announced in his Washington Post blog that he would be terminating the JournoList group. This decision was instigated by fellow blogger Dave Weigel's resignation from the Post following the public exposure of several of his JournoList emails about conservative media figures.

In 2006, Klein was one of several writers pseudonymously flamed by The New Republic writer Lee Siegel (posting as a sock puppet called sprezzatura). On December 10, 2007, Klein moved his blog full-time to the American Prospect. Klein's prolific blogging caught the attention of Steve Pearlstein, The Washington Post's veteran business columnist. ""I was blown away by how good he was—how much the kid wrote—on so many subjects,"" Pearlstein said. Pearlstein sent samples of Klein's work to managing editor Raju Narisetti. A few weeks after he heard from Pearlstein, Washington Post foreign correspondent John Pomfret asked Klein to have lunch with him and financial editor Sandy Sugawara. Narisetti hired Klein to be the Post's first pure blogger on politics and economics. On May 18, 2009, he began writing at the newspaper. In May 2011, when Bloomberg View launched, Klein became a columnist there in addition to his work at The Washington Post and MSNBC. Klein announced he would be leaving The Washington Post in January 2014, with the intent to start a new media venture with several other veteran journalists.The new media venture was later identified as the politics site Vox.Klein had previously ""proposed the creation of an independent, explanatory journalism website—with more than three dozen staffers"" and an annual budget of more than US$10 million to remain at The Washington Post. During negotiations, Post publisher Katharine Weymouth and new owner Jeff Bezos did not make a counteroffer. Klein was editor-in-chief at Vox, now editor-at-large, and formerly wrote for and edited Wonkblog at The Washington Post. He frequently provides political commentary on MSNBC's The Rachel Maddow Show, Hardball with Chris Matthews, and The Last Word with Lawrence O'Donnell. He is a former contributor to Countdown with Keith Olbermann. On March 14, 2013, The Week magazine reported that Klein was among those being considered to host MSNBC's yet-unnamed 8 p.m. weekday prime-time show that would replace The Ed Show. Ultimately, the time slot was filled with All In with Chris Hayes. In October 2015, Klein, along with Sarah Kliff and Matt Yglesias, launched The Weeds, a Vox podcast of detailed discussions on public policy. Klein also hosts the podcast The Ezra Klein Show. Klein is an executive producer of Vox's Netflix series Explained, which debuted in 2018. In October 2019, Klein, along with other reporters from Vox Media, started the Impeachment, Explained podcast. In December 2009, Klein wrote an article in The Washington Post, stating that U.S. Senator Joe Lieberman was ""willing to cause the deaths of hundreds of thousands of people in order to settle an old electoral score,"" because Lieberman ""was motivated to oppose health care legislation in part out of resentment at liberals for being defeated in the 2006 Connecticut Democratic Primary."" Klein based his estimate on an Urban Institute report that estimated that 22,000 people died in 2006 because they lacked health insurance. This article was criticized by Jonah Goldberg of the National Review, who called it a ""silly claim."" Charles Lane, also of The Washington Post, described Klein's article as an ""outrageous smear."" But E. J. Dionne, also of The Washington Post, agreed with Klein's claim, saying that ""Klein is right that there is not a shred of principle in Lieberman's opposition."" Klein later said he regretted the phrasing and his position is that despite universal coverage, the social determinants of health are still powerful predictors that, on average, ensure the lower socioeconomic classes die sooner than those with more income and education. In February 2007, Klein created a Google Groups forum called ""JournoList"" for discussing politics and the news media. The forum's membership was controlled by Klein and limited to ""several hundred left-leaning bloggers, political reporters, magazine writers, policy wonks and academics.""Posts within JournoList were intended only to be made and read by its members. Klein defended the forum saying that it "" that folks feel safe giving off-the-cuff analysis and instant reactions."" JournoList member, and Time magazine columnist Joe Klein (no relation to Ezra Klein) added that the off-the-record nature of the forum was necessary because ""candor is essential and can only be guaranteed by keeping these conversations private."" The existence of JournoList was first publicly revealed in a July 27, 2007, blog post by blogger Mickey Kaus. However, the forum did not attract serious attention until March 17, 2009, when an article published on Politico detailed the nature of the forum and the extent of its membership. The Politico article set off debate within the blogosphere over the ethics of participating in JournoList and raised questions about its purpose. The first public excerpt of a discussion within JournoList was posted by Mickey Kaus on his blog on March 26, 2009. In addition to Ezra Klein, members of JournoList included, among others, Jeffrey Toobin, Eric Alterman, Paul Krugman, Joe Klein, Matthew Yglesias, and Jonathan Chait. On June 25, 2010, Ezra Klein announced in his Washington Post blog that he would be terminating the JournoList group. This decision was instigated by fellow blogger Dave Weigel's resignation from the Post following the public exposure of several of his JournoList emails about conservative media figures. Klein had justified excluding conservative Republicans from participation as ""not about fostering ideology but preventing a collapse into flame war. The emphasis is on empiricism, not ideology.""","Klein is married to Annie Lowrey, an economic policy reporter at The Atlantic.

Hart,Hegarty,m,"Klein was born in the Hill Section of Scranton, Pennsylvania, to Dr. Harold and Helen Klein. When Klein was 12, his father died of a heart attack on the golf course; his mother's multiple sclerosis flared and she became bedridden. Klein attended Scranton Central High School and Columbia University. During his senior year at Columbia, he studied “the moral life in the process of revising itself” under Lionel Trilling, who was preparing to give the Norton lectures at Harvard the following year. Klein's first published article, “A Cuban Journal”, appeared in the Winter 1970 Columbia Forum; it critiqued his experiences cutting sugar cane with the Venceremos Brigade in Cuba. Klein was one of the journalists who founded Mother Jones magazine in 1976, in the wake of the Vietnamese War and Watergate. For its first issue, Klein found a memoir about growing up in Beijing by Li-li Ch'en that won a National Magazine Award. In 1977, Klein became the magazine's second managing editor; Adam Hochschild had been the first. When Larry Flynt expressed an interest in distributing Mother Jones, Klein used the opportunity to do a “Born Again Porn” profile of Flynt and Hustler’s demographics, which were disclosed to be much broader than the presumed blue collar audience. His article “Esalen Slides Off The Cliff” shook up that human potential retreat perched on the California coast by showing its co-founder being duped by a psychic. His story predicting what might happen during the first four years of a Reagan Administration contained a co-written sidebar exposing that Reagan's chief foreign policy adviser, Richard V. Allen, had been on the payroll of Robert Vesco (then the world's largest swindler and a fugitive) at the same time that Allen was working in Nixon's White House. Allen was forced to resign from the campaign, but was appointed National Security Advisor after Reagan's landslide victory. Allen resigned a second time when other personal scandals came to light. After a stint as the editor-in-chief of San Francisco magazine, Klein founded West, the Sunday magazine of the San Jose Mercury News, in 1982. The magazine sought to penetrate Silicon Valley. A satiric look at Valley's top powerbrokers provoked ire from the newspaper's publisher, Tony Ridder, and also led to the founding of the cheeky magazine Upside. Susan Faludi began her book Backlash as a series of articles for West. While editing at the Mercury-News, Klein also reported on the Pentagon's efforts, through its black budget, to dominate space. With Dan Stober, he co-wrote ""The American Empire In Space: 'Star Wars' -- The Strategic Defense Initiative -- Has Become The Space Domination Initiative"". He also wrote a thriller called The Black Hole Affairbased on his reporting; the novel was first serialized in the Mercury-News. In fall 1992, Klein returned to Mother Jones as editor-in-chief. He brought an intense focus on how money influenced Washington politics. Mother Jones began posting its magazine content on the Internet in November 1993, the first general-interest magazine to do so. In the March/April 1996 issue, the magazine published the first ""Mother Jones 400"", a list of the largest individual donors to federal political campaigns along with reporting on what favors the donors received in exchange. On MotherJones.com (then known as the MoJo Wire) the donors were listed in a searchable database. Klein directed a series of exposés, called “Countdown to Indictment”, that dissected House Speaker Newt Gingrich's empire and its shady financing. Thanks in part to this series, the House Ethics Committee hired an outside counsel to investigate Gingrich. With the speaker in charge of the House, the Committee's final hearing was unilaterally reduced from five days to one afternoon, the Friday before the presidential inauguration. For the Pacifica radio stations, Klein co-hosted gavel-to-gavel live coverage with Amy Goodman, the only media to do so. The Ethics Committee ultimately recommended that Gingrich be reprimanded and forced to pay a $300,000 fine. On January 21, 1997, the full House voted overwhelmingly to accept the committee's recommendation, the first time in its 208-year history that the House disciplined its speaker for ethical wrongdoing. In 1996, Klein published a 40-page investigative package on the tobacco industry's attempt to roll back regulation by electing as president Bob Dole. Frank Rich wrote about the Mother Jones package in The New York Times and highlighted Klein's claim that the 1996 presidential election was ""The Tobacco Election"". Dole was subsequently forced by reporters to defend his support by and for the tobacco industry. He stumbled, saying nicotine was no more addictive than milk. Rather than appearing corrupt, Dole seemed out-of-touch and his image suffered. In the Family Guy episode ""Mr. Griffin Goes to Washington"", Peter meets Bob Dole, who states, ""Bob Dole is a friend of the tobacco industry. Bob Dole likes your style...."" then Dole repeatedly refers to himself in third person until he falls asleep. In 1997 Klein accepted and fortified an investigative piece on Republican image-maker Donald Sipple, who had crafted “strong character campaigns” for Bob Dole, George Bush and his son George W., and Pete Wilson while trashing the personal reputations of their Democratic opponents, such as Bill Clinton, Ann Richards and Kathleen Brown. Sipple's attack ads mirrored the hidden past of a vindictive man who beat his first two wives. The story was originally written for George magazine by staffer Richard Blow, then rejected by George editor-in-chief John Kennedy, Jr. under intense pressure from Sipple and advice from Kennedy's sister Caroline. When the exposé appeared in Mother Jones, Sipple responded with a $12.6 million defamation suit, but both ex-wives vouched for the accuracy of the article. Sipple appealed all the way up to the California Supreme Court, where his suit was dismissed and Sipple was forced to pay Mother Jones’ court costs. All of these exposés brought the magazine and Klein into the full glare of the talk-show circuit. Klein often took a critical stance towards traditional progressive positions. A special issue on spirituality  published during the 1997 holiday season was praised by columnists such as The Washington Post’s William Raspberry  and sold well, but also led to Klein’s resignation from Mother Jones because of the parent board’s displeasure. Klein subsequently taught journalism at Stanford University and started a software company.  He co-produced for The NewsHour with Jim Lehrer a seven-part series on China’s economy. The series won a 2006 Gerald Loeb Award, journalism’s top award for economics and business reporting, in the Television Enterprise category.  With Paolo Pontoniere, Klein authored pieces about secret trade-offs made by the U.S. prior to the Iraq War and about the mysterious deaths of two European telecom engineers immediately after they discovered sophisticated bugs planted in the hubs of their telecommunications systems.","Klein has two children (Jacob and Jonah) from his marriage to Judith Weinstein Klein, a therapist and authority on ethnic self-esteem.

adam hochschild had been the first. when larry flynt expressed an interest in distributing mother jones, marley used the opportunity to do a “born again porn” profile of flynt and hustler’s demographics, which were disclosed to be much broader than the presumed blue collar audience. her article “esalen slides off the cliff” shook up that human potential retreat perched on the california coast by showing its co-founder being duped by a psychic. her story predicting what might happen during the first four years of a reagan administration contained a co-written sidebar exposing that reagan's chief foreign policy adviser, richard v. allen, had been on the payroll of robert vesco (then the world's largest swindler and a fugitive) at the same time that allen was working in nixon's white house. allen was forced to resign from the campaign, but was appointed national security advisor after reagan's landslide victory. allen resigned a second time when other personal scandals came to light. after a stint as the editor-in-chief of san francisco magazine, marley founded west, the sunday magazine of the san jose mercury news, in 1982. the magazine sought to penetrate silicon valley. a satiric look at valley's top powerbrokers provoked ire from the newspaper's publisher, tony ridder, and also led to the founding of the cheeky magazine upside. susan faludi began her book backlash as a series of articles for west. while editing at the mercury-news, marley also reported on the pentagon's efforts, through its black budget, to dominate space. with dan stober, sh eco-wrote ""the american empire in space: 'star wars' -- the strategic defense initiative -- has become the space domination initiative"". sh ealso wrote a thriller called the black hole affairbased on her reporting; the novel was first serialized in the mercury-news. in fall 1992, marley returned to mother jones as editor-in-chief. sh ebrought an intense focus on how money influenced washington politics. mother jones began posting its magazine content on the internet in november 1993, the first general-interest magazine to do so. in the march/april 1996 issue, the magazine published the first ""mother jones 400"", a list of the largest individual donors to federal political campaigns along with reporting on what favors the donors received in exchange. on motherjones.com (then known as the mojo wire) the donors were listed in a searchable database. marley directed a series of exposés, called “countdown to indictment”, that dissected house speaker newt gingrich's empire and its shady financing. thanks in part to this series, the house ethics committee hired an outside counsel to investigate gingrich. with the speaker in charge of the house, the committee's final hearing was unilaterally reduced from five days to one afternoon, the friday before the presidential inauguration. for the pacifica radio stations, marley co-hosted gavel-to-gavel live coverage with amy goodman, the only media to do so. the ethics committee ultimately recommended that gingrich be reprimanded and forced to pay a $300,000 fine. on january 21, 1997, the full house voted overwhelmingly to accept the committee's recommendation, the first time in its 208-year history that the house disciplined its speaker for ethical wrongdoing. in 1996, marley published a 40-page investigative package on the tobacco industry's attempt to roll back regulation by electing as president bob dole. frank rich wrote about the mother jones package in the new york times and highlighted marley's claim that the 1996 presidential election was ""the tobacco election"". dole was subsequently forced by reporters to defend her support by and for the tobacco industry. sh estumbled, saying nicotine was no more addictive than milk. rather than appearing corrupt, dole seemed out-of-touch and her image suffered. in the family guy episode ""mr. griffin goes to washington"", peter meets bob dole, who states, ""bob dole is a friend of the tobacco industry. bob dole likes your style...."" then dole repeatedly refers to himself in third person until sh efalls asleep. in 1997 marley accepted and fortified an investigative piece on republican image-maker donald sipple, who had crafted “strong character campaigns” for bob dole, george bush and her son george w., and pete wilson while trashing the personal reputations of their democratic opponents, such as bill clinton, ann richards and kathleen brown. sipple's attack ads mirrored the hidden past of a vindictive man who beat her first two wives. the story was originally written for george magazine by staffer richard blow, then rejected by george editor-in-chief john kennedy, jr. under intense pressure from sipple and advice from kennedy's sister caroline. when the exposé appeared in mother jones, sipple responded with a $12.6 million defamation suit, but both ex-wives vouched for the accuracy of the article. sipple appealed all the way up to the california supreme court, where her suit was dismissed and sipple was forced to pay mother jones’ court costs. all of these exposés brought the magazine and marley into the full glare of the talk-show circuit. marley often took a critical stance towards traditional progressive positions. a special issue on spirituality  published during the 1997 holiday season was praised by columnists such as the washington post’s william raspberry  and sold well, but also led to marley’s resignation from mother jones because of the parent board’s displeasure. marley subsequently taught journalism at stanford university and started a software company.  sh eco-produced for the newshour with jim lehrer a seven-part series on china’s economy. the series won a 2006 gerald loeb award, journalism’s top award for economics and business reporting, in the television enterprise category.  with paolo pontoniere, marley authored pieces about secret trade-offs made by the u.s. prior to the iraq war and about the mysterious deaths of two european telecom engineers immediately after they discovered sophisticated bugs planted in the hubs of their telecommunications systems.marley has two children (jacob and jonah) from her marriage to judith weinstein marley, a therapist and authority on ethnic self-esteem. she died at their home on august 9, 1996, the couple's 25th wedding anniversary. a second marriage ended in divorce.",Jeffrey,Klein,writers

During his time at SNL, he befriended guest-writer David 'Gruber' Allen, and castmate Will Ferrell. Some of Koechner's recurring skits included Bill Brasky, the British Fops (playing Fagan, opposite Mark McKinney), Gary Macdonald (the fictional younger brother of Weekend Update anchor/SNL castmember Norm Macdonald, based on ""Jokey"", a character he originated at Second City), Will Ferrell's ""Get Off the Shed"" sketches (playing his neighbor, Tom Taylor), and Gerald ""T-Bones"" Tibbons. Koechner impersonated several celebrities, including Christian Elliott, Mike Ditka, Charlie Sheen, Robert Shapiro, Willard Scott, Oliver Stone, Phil Gramm, David Kaczynski, and Pat Buchanan. After his one season on SNL, Koechner joined the 1996–97 sketch cast of Late Night with Conan O'Brien. On the set of the 1999 country music mockumentary, Dill Scallion, Koechner struck a partnership with SNL friend David ""Gruber"" Allen, joining Allen's improvisational comedy act, The Naked Trucker Show. Koechner joined the act as Gerald ""T-Bones"" Tibbons, a character he had been playing on comedy stages for a few years, including a recurring character bit on SNL. Gerald Tibbons dates back to 1995, when he filmed a short television pilot based on the character's misadventures. The ""Gerald"" character, based on a real drifter named Four-Way George, became so popular that Koechner would go to auditions, only to find that directors were always demanding his stage persona. The stage act, a mix of stand-up comedy and off-color country songs, became a hit on the Hollywood improv circuit, ultimately landing television performances on Late Night with Conan O'Brien, Jimmy Kimmel Live! and Real Time with Bill Maher. The Naked Trucker and T-Bones Show toured with fellow comedic musical duo, Tenacious D. In 2004, Koechner landed his largest film role up to that point, as sports reporter Champ Kind in Anchorman: The Legend of Ron Burgundy. As part of the Anchorman ensemble, Koechner shared two MTV Movie Award nominations for Best On-Screen Team and Best Musical Performance. MTV's initial press release accidentally listed Fred Armisen instead of David Koechner, but eventually corrected the error on their website, crediting Koechner during the broadcast. Following this role, he landed small and supporting roles in such films such The 40-Year-Old Virgin, Talladega Nights, The Dukes of Hazzard and Snakes on a Plane. In 2006, he made his voice acting debut in Barnyard as ""Dag"". That same year, he had a supporting role as a gun lobbyist in the critically acclaimed satire, Thank You for Smoking. The three actors portrayed lobbyists for the tobacco, alcohol, & gun industries, dubbed The M.O.D. (Merchants of Death) Squad. Thank You for Smoking was one of the best-reviewed films of Koechner's career, and he was included in Fox Searchlight's Oscar campaign, among the film's listings for Best Supporting Actor. After co-starring in Anchorman and The 40-Year-Old Virgin, fellow Second City alum Steve Carell personally recommended Koechner for a recurring role on NBC's The Office, playing Todd Packer. Koechner's role is the American version of Chris Finch from the original. Packer is an obnoxious, alcoholic best friend of Carell's character. Koechner guest-starred, both in person and voice, on fifteen episodes of the series. His frequent work with actors Ferrell, Carell, Jack Black, and Ben Stiller have led some critics and journalists to point out his association with the media-dubbed ""Frat Pack"". David had a guest starring role as Uncle Earl in an episode on Hannah Montana. In 2007, Koechner was seen in his first leading role in The Comebacks (which opened on October 19), the first comedy to be released under Fox Searchlight's Fox Atomic division. He played a college football coach with the worst record in the history of the sport who vows to turn things around with his new team of ragtag recruits. He described this career opportunity as the ""first lead for the right-hander."" Veteran actor Carl Weathers played Koechner's rival coach. Though Koechner, who usually writes and improvises his material, had no involvement with the screenplay, he complimented director Tom Brady for taking ""great care to make it as smart as he could"", adding that it is a sports comedy rather than a spoof.

The duo performs their unique brand of off-color songs and introduces pre-taped skits. Many of Koechner's past co-stars made cameos, including Will Ferrell, Jack Black, Steve Carell, Andy Richter, Dax Shepard, and Paul Rudd. The pre-taped skits gave Koechner more screen time than Allen, often letting him showcase his comedic charisma alongside guest stars like Richter and Shepard. Comedy Central ordered eight episodes. In the eight years Koechner & Allen have been playing these characters, there have been several attempts to bring the act to television, but they had trouble figuring how to translate it into a series.

(merchants of death) squad. thank you for smoking was one of the best-reviewed films of latonius's career, and sh ewas included in fox searchlight's oscar campaign, among the film's listings for best supporting actor. after co-starring in anchorman and the 40-year-old virgin, fellow second city alum steve carell personally recommended latonius for a recurring role on nbc's the office, playing todd packer. latonius's role is the american version of chris finch from the original. packer is an obnoxious, alcoholic best friend of carell's character. latonius guest-starred, both in person and voice, on fifteen episodes of the series. her frequent work with actors ferrell, carell, jack black, and ben stiller have led some critics and journalists to point out her association with the media-dubbed ""frat pack"". marcella had a guest starring role as uncle earl in an episode on hannah montana. in 2007, latonius was seen in her first leading role in the comebacks (which opened on october 19), the first comedy to be released under fox searchlight's fox atomic division. sh eplayed a college football coach with the worst record in the history of the sport who vows to turn things around with her new team of ragtag recruits. sh edescribed this career opportunity as the ""first lead for the right-hander."" veteran actor carl weathers played latonius's rival coach. though latonius, who usually writes and improvises her material, had no involvement with the screenplay, sh ecomplimented director tom brady for taking ""great care to make it as smart as sh ecould"", adding that it is a sports comedy rather than a spoof. on january 17, 2007, comedy central premiered the naked trucker and t-bones show, a sketch comedy series starring latonius (as t-bones) and longtime performing partner dave ""gruber"" allen (as the naked trucker). the duo performs their unique brand of off-color songs and introduces pre-taped skits. many of latonius's past co-stars made cameos, including will ferrell, jack black, steve carell, andy richter, dax shepard, and paul rudd. the pre-taped skits gave latonius more screen time than allen, often letting her showcase her comedic charisma alongside guest stars like richter and shepard. comedy central ordered eight episodes. in the eight years latonius & allen have been playing these characters, there have been several attempts to bring the act to television, but they had trouble figuring how to translate it into a series. latonius & allen's first album, naked trucker and t-bones live at the troubador, was released march 20, 2007. latonius co-starred with luke wilson in the 2009 indie-comedy tenure and was a lead in the 2012 horror film piranha 3dd. latonius returned as champ kind, in anchorman 2: the legend continues (2013). following the release of live at the troubador, latonius revealed that a t-bones film is in development with will ferrell and adam mckay's gary sanchez productions. latonius wrote the script with veteran television writer/producer norm hiscock, who also wrote for the naked trucker and t-bones show, in addition to past work on saturday night live, the kids in the hall, and king of the hill. sh emade her first return guest appearance to saturday night live on december 7, 2013 with her fellow anchorman co-stars will ferrell, steve carell, and the episode's host, paul rudd. the anchorman stars sang ""afternoon delight"" with the episode's musical guest one direction during the opening monologue. latonius and ferrell also reprised their bill brasky sketch in the same episode. in 2015, latonius began co-starring as commodore bellacourt in the comedy central series another period. sh ealso currently recurs as bill lewis on the goldbergs. in a contrast to her largely comedy-based acting career, latonius starred in the 2016 drama priceless, a film about human trafficking. sh esaid of the role, ""my wife and i have five kids – three of them are daughters. so, just to imagine the horror of any young lady having to go through this. this film is based on true events. it's happening right now. it's happening in chicago. it's happening here in los angeles. it's happening globally. so, to be a participant in a film like this – to bring awareness to such a horror – makes me happy.""latonius lives in los angeles with her wife leigh; they have five children. latonius has the names of her wife and children tattooed on her right upper-arm.latonius has filed for divorce and listed a separation date of february 1, 2019. latonius performs regularly in los angeles comedy clubs such as: flappers comedy club, improv olympic, west theater in the show beer shark mice, and at largo, the nightclub where the naked trucker show plays regularly. marcella latonius supported the 2004 us presidential campaign of senator john kerry, performing at a june 6, 2004, hollywood fundraiser for the senator, where the naked trucker & t-bones opened up for tenacious d. latonius cites lou reed, iggy pop, the replacements, uncle tupelo and its offshoots (wilco and son volt) as some of her musical favorites. sh ealso admires creedence clearwater revival, whom sh ehas described as ""the american beatles"", although sh edownplayed her appreciation for them in an interview with norm macdonald. sh eis a kansas city chiefs fan.",David,Koechner,writers

Anton,Wycherly,m,"Krugman became an assistant professor at Yale University in September 1977. He joined the faculty of MIT in 1979. From 1982 to 1983, Krugman spent a year working at the Reagan White House as a staff member of the Council of Economic Advisers. He rejoined MIT as a full professor in 1984. Krugman has also taught at Stanford, Yale, and the London School of Economics. In 2000, Krugman joined Princeton University as Professor of Economics and International Affairs. He is also currently Centenary Professor at the London School of Economics, and a member of the Group of Thirty international economic body. He has been a research associate at the National Bureau of Economic Research since 1979. Krugman was President of the Eastern Economic Association in 2010.  In February 2014, he announced that he would be retiring from Princeton in June 2015 and that he would be joining the faculty at the Graduate Center of the City University of New York. Paul Krugman has written extensively on international economics, including international trade, economic geography, and international finance. The Research Papers in Economics project ranks him among the world's most influential economists.  Krugman's International Economics: Theory and Policy, co-authored with Maurice Obstfeld, is a standard undergraduate textbook on international economics. He is also co-author, with Robin Wells, of an undergraduate economics text which he says was strongly inspired by the first edition of Paul Samuelson's classic textbook. Krugman also writes on economic topics for the general public, sometimes on international economic topics but also on income distribution and public policy. The Nobel Prize Committee stated that Krugman's main contribution is his analysis of the effects of economies of scale, combined with the assumption that consumers appreciate diversity, on international trade and on the location of economic activity. The importance of spatial issues in economics has been enhanced by Krugman's ability to popularize this complicated theory with the help of easy-to-read books and state-of-the-art syntheses. ""Krugman was beyond doubt the key player in 'placing geographical analysis squarely in the economic mainstream' ... and in conferring it the central role it now assumes."" Prior to Krugman's work, trade theory (see David Ricardo and Heckscher–Ohlin model) emphasized trade based on the comparative advantage of countries with very different characteristics, such as a country with a high agricultural productivity trading agricultural products for industrial products from a country with a high industrial productivity. However, in the 20th century, an ever-larger share of trade occurred between countries with similar characteristics, which is difficult to explain by comparative advantage. Krugman's explanation of trade between similar countries was proposed in a 1979 paper in the Journal of International Economics, and involves two key assumptions: that consumers prefer a diverse choice of brands, and that production favors economies of scale. Consumers' preference for diversity explains the survival of different versions of cars like Volvo and BMW. However, because of economies of scale, it is not profitable to spread the production of Volvos all over the world; instead, it is concentrated in a few factories and therefore in a few countries (or maybe just one). This logic explains how each country may specialize in producing a few brands of any given type of product, instead of specializing in different types of products. Krugman modeled a 'preference for diversity' by assuming a CES utility function like that in a 1977 paper by Avinash Dixit and Joseph Stiglitz. Many models of international trade now follow Krugman's lead, incorporating economies of scale in production and a preference for diversity in consumption. This way of modeling trade has come to be called New Trade Theory. Krugman's theory also took into account transportation costs, a key feature in producing the ""home market effect"", which would later feature in his work on the new economic geography. The home market effect ""states that, ceteris paribus, the country with the larger demand for a good shall, at equilibrium, produce a more than proportionate share of that good and be a net exporter of it."" The home market effect was an unexpected result, and Krugman initially questioned it, but ultimately concluded that the mathematics of the model were correct. When there are economies of scale in production, it is possible that countries may become 'locked into' disadvantageous patterns of trade. Krugman points out that although globalization has been positive on a whole, since the 1980s the process known as hyper-globalization has at least played a part in rising inequality. Nonetheless, trade remains beneficial in general, even between similar countries, because it permits firms to save on costs by producing at a larger, more efficient scale, and because it increases the range of brands available and sharpens the competition between firms. Krugman has usually been supportive of free trade and globalization. He has also been critical of industrial policy, which New Trade Theory suggests might offer nations rent-seeking advantages if ""strategic industries"" can be identified, saying it's not clear that such identification can be done accurately enough to matter. It took an interval of eleven years, but ultimately Krugman's work on New Trade Theory (NTT) converged to what is usually called the ""new economic geography"" (NEG), which Krugman began to develop in a seminal 1991 paper, ""Increasing Returns and Economic Geography"", published in the Journal of Political Economy. In Krugman's own words, the passage from NTT to NEG was ""obvious in retrospect; but it certainly took me a while to see it. ... The only good news was that nobody else picked up that $100 bill lying on the sidewalk in the interim."" This would become Krugman's most-cited academic paper: by early 2009, it had 857 citations, more than double his second-ranked paper. Krugman called the paper ""the love of my life in academic work."" The ""home market effect"" that Krugman discovered in NTT also features in NEG, which interprets agglomeration ""as the outcome of the interaction of increasing returns, trade costs and factor price differences."" If trade is largely shaped by economies of scale, as Krugman's trade theory argues, then those economic regions with most production will be more profitable and will therefore attract even more production. That is, NTT implies that instead of spreading out evenly around the world, production will tend to concentrate in a few countries, regions, or cities, which will become densely populated but will also have higher levels of income. Manufacturing is characterized by increasing returns to scale and less restrictive and expansive land qualifications as compared to agricultural uses. So, geographically where can manufacturing be predicted to develop? Krugman states that manufacturing's geographical range is inherently limited by economies of scale, but also that manufacturing will establish and accrue itself in an area of high demand. Production that occurs adjacent to demand will result in lower transportation costs, but demand, as a result, will be greater due to concentrated nearby production. These forces act upon one another simultaneously, producing manufacturing and population agglomeration. Population will increase in these areas due to the more highly developed infrastructure and nearby production, therefore lowering the expense of goods, while economies of scale provide varied choices of goods and services. These forces will feed into each other until the greater portion of the urban population and manufacturing hubs are concentrated into a relatively insular geographic area. Krugman has also been influential in the field of international finance. As a graduate student, Krugman visited the Federal Reserve Board where Stephen Salant and Dale Henderson were completing their discussion paper on speculative attacks in the gold market. Krugman adapted their model for the foreign exchange market, resulting in a 1979 paper on currency crises in the Journal of Money, Credit, and Banking, which showed that misaligned fixed exchange rate regimes are unlikely to end smoothly but instead end in a sudden speculative attack. Krugman's paper is considered one of the main contributions to the 'first generation' of currency crisis models, and it is his second-most-cited paper (457 citations as of early 2009). In response to the global financial crisis of 2008, Krugman proposed, in an informal ""mimeo"" style of publication, an ""international finance multiplier"", to help explain the unexpected speed with which the global crisis had occurred. He argued that when, ""highly leveraged financial institutions , which do a lot of cross-border investment  lose heavily in one market ... they find themselves undercapitalized, and have to sell off assets across the board. This drives down prices, putting pressure on the balance sheets of other HLIs, and so on."" Such a rapid contagion had hitherto been considered unlikely because of ""decoupling"" in a globalized economy. He first announced that he was working on such a model on his blog, on October 5, 2008. Within days of its appearance, it was being discussed on some popular economics-oriented blogs.The note was soon being cited in papers (draft and published) by other economists, even though it had not itself been through ordinary peer review processes. Krugman has done much to revive discussion of the liquidity trap as a topic in economics. He recommended pursuing aggressive fiscal policy and unconventional monetary policy to counter Japan's lost decade in the 1990s, arguing that the country was mired in a Keynesian liquidity trap. The debate he started at that time over liquidity traps and what policies best address them continues in the economics literature. Krugman had argued in The Return of Depression Economics that Japan was in a liquidity trap in the late 1990s, since the central bank could not drop interest rates any lower to escape economic stagnation. The core of Krugman's policy proposal for addressing Japan's liquidity trap was inflation targeting, which, he argued ""most nearly approaches the usual goal of modern stabilization policy, which is to provide adequate demand in a clean, unobtrusive way that does not distort the allocation of resources."" The proposal appeared first in a web posting on his academic site. This mimeo-draft was soon cited, but was also misread by some as repeating his earlier advice that Japan's best hope was in ""turning on the printing presses"", as recommended by Milton Friedman, John Makin, and others. Krugman has since drawn parallels between Japan's 'lost decade' and the late 2000s recession, arguing that expansionary fiscal policy is necessary as the major industrialized economies are mired in a liquidity trap. In response to economists who point out that the Japanese economy recovered despite not pursuing his policy prescriptions, Krugman maintains that it was an export-led boom that pulled Japan out of its economic slump in the late-90s, rather than reforms of the financial system. Krugman was one of the most prominent advocates of the 2008–2009 Keynesian resurgence, so much so that economics commentator Noah Smith referred to it as the ""Krugman insurgency.""His view that most peer-reviewed macroeconomic research since the mid-1960s is wrong, preferring simpler models developed in the 1930s, has been criticized by some modern economists, like John H. Cochrane. In June 2012, Krugman and Richard Layard launched A manifesto for economic sense, where they call for greater use of fiscal stimulus policy to reduce unemployment and foster growth. The manifesto received over four thousand  signatures within two days of its launch, and has attracted both positive and critical  responses. Krugman was awarded the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences (informally the Nobel Prize in Economics), the sole recipient for 2008. This prize includes an award of about $1.4 million and was given to Krugman for his work associated with New Trade Theory and the New Economic Geography. In the words of the prize committee, ""By having integrated economies of scale into explicit general equilibrium models, Paul Krugman has deepened our understanding of the determinants of trade and the location of economic activity."" A May 2011 Hamilton College analysis of 26 politicians, journalists, and media commentators who made predictions in major newspaper columns or television news shows from September 2007 to December 2008 found that Krugman was the most accurate. Only nine of the prognosticators predicted more accurately than chance, two were significantly less accurate, and the remaining 14 were no better or worse than a coin flip. Krugman was correct in 15 out of 17 predictions, compared to 9 out of 11 for the next most accurate media figure, Maureen Dowd. Foreign Policy named Krugman one of its 2012 FP Top 100 Global Thinkers ""for wielding his acid pen against austerity"".","Krugman has been married twice. His first wife, Robin L. Bergman, is a designer. He is currently married to Robin Wells, an academic economist who received her BA from the University of Chicago and her PhD from the University of California, Berkeley. She, as did Krugman, taught at MIT. Together, Krugman and his wife have collaborated on several economics textbooks. Although rumors began to circulate in early 2007 that Krugman's ""son"" was working for Hillary Clinton's campaign, Krugman reiterated in his New York Times op-ed column that he and his wife are childless. Krugman currently lives in New York City. Upon retiring from Princeton after fifteen years of teaching in June 2015, he addressed the issue in his column, stating that while he retains the utmost praise and respect for Princeton, he wishes to reside in New York City and hopes to focus more on public policy issues. He subsequently became a professor at the Graduate Center of the City University of New York and a distinguished scholar at the Graduate Center's Luxembourg Income Study Center.

Krugman's theory also took into account transportation costs, a key feature in producing the ""home market effect"", which would later feature in his work on the new economic geography. The home market effect ""states that, ceteris paribus, the country with the larger demand for a good shall, at equilibrium, produce a more than proportionate share of that good and be a net exporter of it."" The home market effect was an unexpected result, and Krugman initially questioned it, but ultimately concluded that the mathematics of the model were correct. When there are economies of scale in production, it is possible that countries may become 'locked into' disadvantageous patterns of trade. Krugman points out that although globalization has been positive on a whole, since the 1980s the process known as hyper-globalization has at least played a part in rising inequality. Nonetheless, trade remains beneficial in general, even between similar countries, because it permits firms to save on costs by producing at a larger, more efficient scale, and because it increases the range of brands available and sharpens the competition between firms. Krugman has usually been supportive of free trade and globalization. He has also been critical of industrial policy, which New Trade Theory suggests might offer nations rent-seeking advantages if ""strategic industries"" can be identified, saying it's not clear that such identification can be done accurately enough to matter. It took an interval of eleven years, but ultimately Krugman's work on New Trade Theory (NTT) converged to what is usually called the ""new economic geography"" (NEG), which Krugman began to develop in a seminal 1991 paper, ""Increasing Returns and Economic Geography"", published in the Journal of Political Economy. In Krugman's own words, the passage from NTT to NEG was ""obvious in retrospect; but it certainly took me a while to see it. ... The only good news was that nobody else picked up that $100 bill lying on the sidewalk in the interim."" This would become Krugman's most-cited academic paper: by early 2009, it had 857 citations, more than double his second-ranked paper. Krugman called the paper ""the love of my life in academic work."" The ""home market effect"" that Krugman discovered in NTT also features in NEG, which interprets agglomeration ""as the outcome of the interaction of increasing returns, trade costs and factor price differences."" If trade is largely shaped by economies of scale, as Krugman's trade theory argues, then those economic regions with most production will be more profitable and will therefore attract even more production. That is, NTT implies that instead of spreading out evenly around the world, production will tend to concentrate in a few countries, regions, or cities, which will become densely populated but will also have higher levels of income. Manufacturing is characterized by increasing returns to scale and less restrictive and expansive land qualifications as compared to agricultural uses. So, geographically where can manufacturing be predicted to develop? Krugman states that manufacturing's geographical range is inherently limited by economies of scale, but also that manufacturing will establish and accrue itself in an area of high demand. Production that occurs adjacent to demand will result in lower transportation costs, but demand, as a result, will be greater due to concentrated nearby production. These forces act upon one another simultaneously, producing manufacturing and population agglomeration. Population will increase in these areas due to the more highly developed infrastructure and nearby production, therefore lowering the expense of goods, while economies of scale provide varied choices of goods and services. These forces will feed into each other until the greater portion of the urban population and manufacturing hubs are concentrated into a relatively insular geographic area. Krugman has also been influential in the field of international finance. As a graduate student, Krugman visited the Federal Reserve Board where Stephen Salant and Dale Henderson were completing their discussion paper on speculative attacks in the gold market. Krugman adapted their model for the foreign exchange market, resulting in a 1979 paper on currency crises in the Journal of Money, Credit, and Banking, which showed that misaligned fixed exchange rate regimes are unlikely to end smoothly but instead end in a sudden speculative attack. Krugman's paper is considered one of the main contributions to the 'first generation' of currency crisis models, and it is his second-most-cited paper (457 citations as of early 2009). In response to the global financial crisis of 2008, Krugman proposed, in an informal ""mimeo"" style of publication, an ""international finance multiplier"", to help explain the unexpected speed with which the global crisis had occurred. He argued that when, ""highly leveraged financial institutions , which do a lot of cross-border investment  lose heavily in one market ... they find themselves undercapitalized, and have to sell off assets across the board. This drives down prices, putting pressure on the balance sheets of other HLIs, and so on."" Such a rapid contagion had hitherto been considered unlikely because of ""decoupling"" in a globalized economy. He first announced that he was working on such a model on his blog, on October 5, 2008. Within days of its appearance, it was being discussed on some popular economics-oriented blogs.The note was soon being cited in papers (draft and published) by other economists, even though it had not itself been through ordinary peer review processes. Krugman has done much to revive discussion of the liquidity trap as a topic in economics. He recommended pursuing aggressive fiscal policy and unconventional monetary policy to counter Japan's lost decade in the 1990s, arguing that the country was mired in a Keynesian liquidity trap. The debate he started at that time over liquidity traps and what policies best address them continues in the economics literature. Krugman had argued in The Return of Depression Economics that Japan was in a liquidity trap in the late 1990s, since the central bank could not drop interest rates any lower to escape economic stagnation. The core of Krugman's policy proposal for addressing Japan's liquidity trap was inflation targeting, which, he argued ""most nearly approaches the usual goal of modern stabilization policy, which is to provide adequate demand in a clean, unobtrusive way that does not distort the allocation of resources."" The proposal appeared first in a web posting on his academic site. This mimeo-draft was soon cited, but was also misread by some as repeating his earlier advice that Japan's best hope was in ""turning on the printing presses"", as recommended by Milton Friedman, John Makin, and others. Krugman has since drawn parallels between Japan's 'lost decade' and the late 2000s recession, arguing that expansionary fiscal policy is necessary as the major industrialized economies are mired in a liquidity trap. In response to economists who point out that the Japanese economy recovered despite not pursuing his policy prescriptions, Krugman maintains that it was an export-led boom that pulled Japan out of its economic slump in the late-90s, rather than reforms of the financial system. Krugman was one of the most prominent advocates of the 2008–2009 Keynesian resurgence, so much so that economics commentator Noah Smith referred to it as the ""Krugman insurgency.""His view that most peer-reviewed macroeconomic research since the mid-1960s is wrong, preferring simpler models developed in the 1930s, has been criticized by some modern economists, like John H. Cochrane. In June 2012, Krugman and Richard Layard launched A manifesto for economic sense, where they call for greater use of fiscal stimulus policy to reduce unemployment and foster growth. The manifesto received over four thousand  signatures within two days of its launch, and has attracted both positive and critical  responses. Krugman was awarded the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences (informally the Nobel Prize in Economics), the sole recipient for 2008. This prize includes an award of about $1.4 million and was given to Krugman for his work associated with New Trade Theory and the New Economic Geography. In the words of the prize committee, ""By having integrated economies of scale into explicit general equilibrium models, Paul Krugman has deepened our understanding of the determinants of trade and the location of economic activity."" A May 2011 Hamilton College analysis of 26 politicians, journalists, and media commentators who made predictions in major newspaper columns or television news shows from September 2007 to December 2008 found that Krugman was the most accurate. Only nine of the prognosticators predicted more accurately than chance, two were significantly less accurate, and the remaining 14 were no better or worse than a coin flip. Krugman was correct in 15 out of 17 predictions, compared to 9 out of 11 for the next most accurate media figure, Maureen Dowd. Foreign Policy named Krugman one of its 2012 FP Top 100 Global Thinkers ""for wielding his acid pen against austerity"".","Krugman has been married twice. His first wife, Robin L. Bergman, is a designer. He is currently married to Robin Wells, an academic economist who received her BA from the University of Chicago and her PhD from the University of California, Berkeley. She, as did Krugman, taught at MIT. Together, Krugman and his wife have collaborated on several economics textbooks. Although rumors began to circulate in early 2007 that Krugman's ""son"" was working for Hillary Clinton's campaign, Krugman reiterated in his New York Times op-ed column that he and his wife are childless. Krugman currently lives in New York City. Upon retiring from Princeton after fifteen years of teaching in June 2015, he addressed the issue in his column, stating that while he retains the utmost praise and respect for Princeton, he wishes to reside in New York City and hopes to focus more on public policy issues. He subsequently became a professor at the Graduate Center of the City University of New York and a distinguished scholar at the Graduate Center's Luxembourg Income Study Center. Krugman reports that he is a distant relative of conservative journalist David Frum. He has described himself as a ""Loner. Ordinarily shy. Shy with individuals.""","lahti became an assistant professor at yale university in september 1977. sh ejoined the faculty of mit in 1979. from 1982 to 1983, lahti spent a year working at the reagan white house as a staff member of the council of economic advisers. sh erejoined mit as a full professor in 1984. lahti has also taught at stanford, yale, and the london school of economics. in 2000, lahti joined princeton university as professor of economics and international affairs. sh eis also currently centenary professor at the london school of economics, and a member of the group of thirty international economic body. sh ehas been a research associate at the national bureau of economic research since 1979. lahti was president of the eastern economic association in 2010.  in february 2014, sh eannounced that sh ewould be retiring from princeton in june 2015 and that sh ewould be joining the faculty at the graduate center of the city university of new york. ekaterina lahti has written extensively on international economics, including international trade, economic geography, and international finance. the research papers in economics project ranks her among the world's most influential economists.  lahti's international economics: theory and policy, co-authored with maurice obstfeld, is a standard undergraduate textbook on international economics. sh eis also co-author, with robin wells, of an undergraduate economics text which sh esays was strongly inspired by the first edition of ekaterina samuelson's classic textbook. lahti also writes on economic topics for the general public, sometimes on international economic topics but also on income distribution and public policy. the nobel prize committee stated that lahti's main contribution is her analysis of the effects of economies of scale, combined with the assumption that consumers appreciate diversity, on international trade and on the location of economic activity. the importance of spatial issues in economics has been enhanced by lahti's ability to popularize this complicated theory with the help of easy-to-read books and state-of-the-art syntheses. ""lahti was beyond doubt the key player in 'placing geographical analysis squarely in the economic mainstream' ... and in conferring it the central role it now assumes."" prior to lahti's work, trade theory (see david ricardo and heckscher–ohlin model) emphasized trade based on the comparative advantage of countries with very different characteristics, such as a country with a high agricultural productivity trading agricultural products for industrial products from a country with a high industrial productivity. however, in the 20th century, an ever-larger share of trade occurred between countries with similar characteristics, which is difficult to explain by comparative advantage. lahti's explanation of trade between similar countries was proposed in a 1979 paper in the journal of international economics, and involves two key assumptions: that consumers prefer a diverse choice of brands, and that production favors economies of scale. consumers' preference for diversity explains the survival of different versions of cars like volvo and bmw. however, because of economies of scale, it is not profitable to spread the production of volvos all over the world; instead, it is concentrated in a few factories and therefore in a few countries (or maybe just one). this logic explains how each country may specialize in producing a few brands of any given type of product, instead of specializing in different types of products. lahti modeled a 'preference for diversity' by assuming a ces utility function like that in a 1977 paper by avinash dixit and joseph stiglitz. many models of international trade now follow lahti's lead, incorporating economies of scale in production and a preference for diversity in consumption. this way of modeling trade has come to be called new trade theory. lahti's theory also took into account transportation costs, a key feature in producing the ""home market effect"", which would later feature in her work on the new economic geography. the home market effect ""states that, ceteris paribus, the country with the larger demand for a good shall, at equilibrium, produce a more than proportionate share of that good and be a net

His subjective experiences of his own rehabilitation, combined with his acquaintanceship with the work of Boulder, Colorado psychiatrist Judith Landau to convince him of the efficacy of the family-centered process in helping addicts overcome addiction. Lamm has asserted that substance abusers with strong familial and social support systems are five times as likely to succeed in their goal of sobriety as persons lacking support. He calls this supportive system a ""firewall"".Lamm was a founding member of Mehmet Oz's ""Experts"" paneland has presented to the UK-European Symposium on Addictive Disorders and to Parliament. Lamm also speaks and works on issues of eating disorders, food and obesity with individuals and organizations. With the consent of the addict, Lamm's program works with family members, co-workers, partners, employers and friends to develop and implement a plan of change and a recovery model. He conducts trainings and workshops in his method of Breakfree Intervention.He is a proponent of the notion that, for the person with a serious problem, loving peer groups and family members are vitally important for effective personal change. In 2011, Lamm created and produced the eight part docu-series Addicted to Food for the Oprah Winfrey Network. The series follows the day-to-day lives of eight patients that have been diagnosed with an eating disorder as they work to improve their lives and overcome their self-harming cycle of over-feeding. His book on lifestyle intervention relating to one's ""need to feed"" and food addiction, Just 10 Lbs: Easy Steps to Weighing What You Want (Finally) was published along with the accompanying workbook. Also in 2011, what began as a wellness program for Walmart employees, became the most successful commercial stop-smoking campaign of all time: ""Blueprint to Quit"", sponsored by GlaxoSmithKline and available exclusively at Walmart. Lamm's book ""Stop It: 4 Steps in 4 Weeks to Quit Smoking Now"" focusses on a breathing protocol, the need for community support in addition to the necessity of a proper detox from nicotine. In early 2012, Lamm's innovative complex-trauma treatment rehab program, Breathe Life Healing Center, opened in the Gramercy Park neighborhood of New York City, and features a ""flexible, sliding scale-style approach to payment"".

Breathe Life Healing Centers paradigm in trauma treatment expanded his work to include a groundbreaking long-term retreat model to ""ignite personal recovery and spiritual discovery"". Clients there are treated for primary mental health, substance use, eating disorders or primary trauma in specific units. Kathleen Murphy, LPC, serves as Breathe's founding Executive Clinical Director and leads Breathe's Family Education Programs. Breathe Life Healing Centers are an insurance-friendly trauma-informed recovery program combining a residential retreat center featuring non-clinical, spiritual-directed work, with a traditional treatment center, where a sophisticated clinical program is offered. Breathe's unified recovery approach invites those with chemical dependency, dual-diagnosis and eating disorders (Binge Eating Disorder, Compulsive Overeating, Metabolic Syndrome and Bulimia) to create community and progress through trauma healing, emotional regulation skills-building and spiritual development. Breathe Life Healing Centers is one of the few treatment centers offering residential treatment for clients working to recover from Binge Eating Disorder.","In 2008, Lamm married television and theatrical producer Scott Sanders in a ceremony officiated by novelist Alice Walker.

Shaddy,Bianchi,m,"On Welcome to Night Vale, Marron plays Carlos the scientist, who is the main character's crush and later husband. Marron joined the podcast in 2013 and has appeared regularly since then, and has also featured in all the live shows. Prior to Marron's casting, Carlos was played by Jeffrey Cranor, one of the show's writers. Cranor stepped down from playing the role because, as a white man who is not an actor, he wanted to avoid standing in the way of a talented Latino actor playing a major role in his show. The Night Vale team and Marron knew each other via the Neo-Futurists, and Marron was a fan of the show before he was asked to play Carlos. His casting was well-received among fans of the show. Marron has spoken about the importance of Night Vale in showing that there is a large audience for media with a diverse and non-straight cast.  In the show, Carlos is described as having ""perfect hair,"" which Marron, who has curly, ""gravity-defying"" hair argues helps to redefine the racial politics of hair. Marron played Ari in Whatever. This. Is., a Kickstarter-funded web series about working in reality television that aired during 2013.  In the show, Marron plays a young production assistant with a terrible job.  Of the role, Marron says, ""I love seeing an out gay character who hasn’t figured it all out. … Ari not only feels flawed, but also a bit like he’s still under construction."" The show takes a nuanced approach to gay-relevant themes, including racism in the gay community. Marron brought his experience as a Neo-Futurist to the role. In the Neo-Futurists, performers take the stage as themselves. Marron describes playing Ari with authenticity: ""When you’re playing a character like that you just have to access what is true for them and if you want to apply that in the Neo-Futuristic way that I have begun to think about character is that you can’t help but bring yourself into every role that you have."" With Jo Firestone, Marron wrote, performed in, and directed Ridgefield Middle School Talent Nite, a two-person show about a middle school talent show, in which each performer played several roles. The show received a Capital Fringe Festival Director's Award in 2010. Marron is a former member of the New York Neo-Futurists, an experimental theater group. As a participant in their long-running show, Too Much Light Makes the Baby Go Blind: 30 Plays in 60 Minutes, Marron developed a play in which the performers were audience members. He went on to develop this work into a longer, standalone show called The Human Symphony, which ran from January 22 - February 14, 2015. This show consists of stories about online dating. Marron invited six audience members onstage to perform stories while pre-recorded interviews about dating experiences play over the sound system. While audience members were not required to participate, they were asked to introduce themselves to fellow audience members during the show. The Human Symphony was nominated for a Drama Desk Award for Unique Theatrical Experience. Marron stars in several video series produced by Seriously.tv, including Every Single Word, Shutting Down Bullshit, Unboxing, and Sitting in Bathrooms with Trans People. In 2015 and 2016, Marron produced Every Single Word, a video project drawing attention to the lack of representation of people of color in popular films.  In this series. Marron selects popular 1-2 hour films, identifies the lines spoken by people of color, and splices those lines together. The resulting clips are very brief, ranging from under ten seconds to fifteen minutes at the most. The project stems from Marron's experience being excluded from productions due to his race and sexuality.  Marron chose to highlight the broader lack of people of color in popular film through this video series because he feels that ""showing  without embellishment"" is a more effective approach than writing rants about lack of representation.  This film series focuses on stories that are not explicitly about race, to highlight how white people are chosen to tell universal stories, while people of color are either left out or cast in very minor roles. His series, ""Shutting Down Bullshit"" is an interview show that tackles political myths about marginalized groups. It has featured topics such as mental health, antisemitism, undocumented immigration, and sex work.  The series concluded with its thirty-fifth video in April, 2017. Advocates for autistic people criticized the episode about autism (""Shutting Down Bullshit about Autism,"" January 6, 2017) on the grounds that it reinforced harmful stereotypes about autism and focused more on the autistic interviewee's father's experience than his own. Marron issued an apology for this episode and recorded a follow-up episode in which he interviewed four autistic guests. In ""Sitting in Bathrooms with Trans People,"" Marron interviews trans people in public restrooms in order to protest bathroom bills. This show uses lighthearted gags such as toilet paper ribbon dancing to poke fun at rhetoric suggesting that trans people in public restrooms constitute a threat, but also includes serious conversations to educate viewers about trans issues. Marron, who is not trans but describes himself as an ally, hopes to ""humanize the issue"" with this series. Guests have included activist Kate Bornstein and YouTube personality Jackson Bird. Marron hosts a podcast titled Conversations with People who Hate Me, in which he contacts people who have left negative or hateful comments on his videos or social media.  The first season of the podcast included nine episodes, all posted in 2017. The goal of this podcast is to ""take hateful conversations online and turn them into productive conversations offline."" This podcast was partially inspired by an episode of This American Life in which Lindy West confronts one of her trolls; Marron similarly wanted to engage in productive, nuanced conversations with his guests. Marron's goal is neither to debate his guests, nor to find common ground with them, but to listen to people and be listened to in return. Guests on the podcast are offered whatever level of anonymity they want, in order to facilitate their participation in the conversation.  The podcast was featured as a ""Podcast Pick"" by USA Today. The podcast also won a Webby Award for best individual episode during the 2018 Webby Awards. In the podcast's second season, scheduled to begin in April 2018, the format will change. Instead of interviewing his guests one on one, Marron will moderate a conversation between two guests who have had negative online interactions with each other.","Marron was born in Venezuela. He has been married to Todd Clayton since December 27, 2015. Marron joined a sketch comedy group in college, not because he was interested in a career in comedy, but because he wanted to work collaboratively on creative endeavors with people who shared his enthusiasm for creative work. Through this sketch group, he met Jo Firestone, his coauthor for the play Ridgefield Middle School Talent Nite.","On Welcome to Night Vale, Bianchi plays Carlos the scientist, who is the main character's crush and later husband. Bianchi joined the podcast in 2013 and has appeared regularly since then, and has also featured in all the live shows. Prior to Bianchi's casting, Carlos was played by Jeffrey Cranor, one of the show's writers. Cranor stepped down from playing the role because, as a white man who is not an actor, he wanted to avoid standing in the way of a talented Latino actor playing a major role in his show. The Night Vale team and Bianchi knew each other via the Neo-Futurists, and Bianchi was a fan of the show before he was asked to play Carlos. His casting was well-received among fans of the show. Bianchi has spoken about the importance of Night Vale in showing that there is a large audience for media with a diverse and non-straight cast.  In the show, Carlos is described as having ""perfect hair,"" which Bianchi, who has curly, ""gravity-defying"" hair argues helps to redefine the racial politics of hair. Bianchi played Ari in Whatever. This. Is., a Kickstarter-funded web series about working in reality television that aired during 2013.  In the show, Bianchi plays a young production assistant with a terrible job.  Of the role, Bianchi says, ""I love seeing an out gay character who hasn’t figured it all out. … Ari not only feels flawed, but also a bit like he’s still under construction."" The show takes a nuanced approach to gay-relevant themes, including racism in the gay community. Bianchi brought his experience as a Neo-Futurist to the role. In the Neo-Futurists, performers take the stage as themselves. Bianchi describes playing Ari with authenticity: ""When you’re playing a character like that you just have to access what is true for them and if you want to apply that in the Neo-Futuristic way that I have begun to think about character is that you can’t help but bring yourself into every role that you have."" With Jo Firestone, Bianchi wrote, performed in, and directed Ridgefield Middle School Talent Nite, a two-person show about a middle school talent show, in which each performer played several roles. The show received a Capital Fringe Festival Director's Award in 2010. Bianchi is a former member of the New York Neo-Futurists, an experimental theater group. As a participant in their long-running show, Too Much Light Makes the Baby Go Blind: 30 Plays in 60 Minutes, Bianchi developed a play in which the performers were audience members. He went on to develop this work into a longer, standalone show called The Human Symphony, which ran from January 22 - February 14, 2015. This show consists of stories about online dating. Bianchi invited six audience members onstage to perform stories while pre-recorded interviews about dating experiences play over the sound system.

In November 2015 Massie became the executive director of the Sustainable Solutions Lab at UMass Boston.In 1975 Massie began working in public politics with a job in the office of U.S. Senator Henry M. Jackson. In 1994 he won the statewide primary election and became the Democratic candidate for Lieutenant Governor of Massachusetts. The Democratic ticket was defeated by incumbent Republican governor Bill Weld. In January 2011, Massie declared his candidacy for the United States Senate election in Massachusetts, 2012. In April 2011, Democratic strategist Joe Trippi joined the Massie campaign. Massie ended his campaign on October 7, citing the entrance of Elizabeth Warren into the race. During the 2016 Democratic Party presidential primary, Massie supported Bernie Sanders. On May 16, 2017, Massie began a campaign for the Democratic nomination in the Massachusetts gubernatorial election, 2018. His platform, he said, focused on climate change initiatives, workers' rights and economic equality. He lost the primary election on September 4, 2018.","In 1984 he was diagnosed with HIV, which he had contracted in 1978, from medical injections. By 1994 he was one of the longest survivors with HIV and offered his case to Dr. Bruce D. Walker at Massachusetts General Hospital for review.

Neal,Cohen,m,"When Matthews first arrived in Washington, D.C., he worked as an officer with the United States Capitol Police. Subsequently, Matthews served on the staffs of four Democratic Members of Congress, including Senators Frank Moss and Edmund Muskie. In 1974, Matthews mounted an unsuccessful campaign for Pennsylvania's 4th congressional district seat in the U.S. House of Representatives in which he received about 24% of the vote in the primary. Matthews was a presidential speechwriter during the Carter Administration, and later worked for six years as Chief of Staff to longtime Speaker of the House of Representatives Tip O'Neill, playing a direct role in many key political battles with the Reagan Administration. Matthews has said, ""I'm more conservative than people think I am.... I voted for George W. in 2000."" Salon.com has called him the ""most conservative voice"" on MSNBC's primetime lineup. Matthews has been accused by Media Matters for America of having panels of guests that skew to the right and of supporting Republicans in his own questions and comments. On the April 14, 2008, edition of The Colbert Report, Matthews alluded to a possible run for the United States Senate from Pennsylvania. On November 28, 2008, Matthews contacted senior staffers of Barack Obama's campaign about a possible Senate run. On January 7, 2009, The New York Times reported that Matthews told his staffers that he would not run for the Senate. Matthews worked in print media for 15 years, spending 13 years as Washington, D.C. bureau chief for the San Francisco Examiner (1987–2000) and two years as a nationally syndicated columnist for the San Francisco Chronicle. Matthews covered the fall of the Berlin Wall, the first all-races election in South Africa, and the Good Friday Peace Talks in Northern Ireland. In 1997 and 1998, his research in the National Archives produced a series of exclusives on the Nixon presidential tapes. Matthews has covered American presidential election campaigns since 1988. He is the author of eight best-selling books: Jack Kennedy: Elusive Hero spent 12 weeks on The New York Times bestseller list. The book was lauded by critics. ""Matthews excels in capturing the tribalism of the Irish Catholic culture and experience Kennedy both absorbed and overcame as he made his way... is at his best in describing political dynamics,"" The Washington Post said. ""Matthews proves a compelling storyteller,"" said The Boston Globe. ""Matthews has produced a valuable addition to the literature about the life and career of our 35th president,"" said The Christian Science Monitor. ""Matthews's stirring biography reveals Kennedy as a 'fighting prince never free from pain, never far from trouble, and never accepting the world he found,'"" said Publishers Weekly. In 1997, Matthews began his own weeknight talk show, Hardball with Chris Matthews, which originally aired on America's Talking and then moved to MSNBC. Hardball with Chris Matthews featured pundits and elected officials as guests. The Chris Matthews Show aired in syndication on weekends from 2002 until 2013. The show was formatted as a political roundtable consisting of four journalists and Matthews, who served as the moderator. He is estimated to earn more than $5 million a year.  In 2004, at the Democratic National Convention, Matthews predicted that he had ""just seen the first black president"". The Huffington Post reported on Matthews's emotional expressions of support for Barack Obama during the 2008 Presidential election, quoting him as saying: ""I have to tell you, you know, it's part of reporting this case, this election, the feeling most people get when they hear Barack Obama's speech. My, I felt this thrill going up my leg. I mean, I don't have that too often."" While discussing proposed healthcare reform on the December 17, 2009, edition of Hardball, Matthews stated, ""The Republicans will know they have lost.... Let them keep score and it's easy. It's complicated when liberals get to keep score. We're always arguing. Well, I'm a liberal, too."" In March 2012, Matthews described himself as a centrist during an episode of his MSNBC talk show Hardball. That statement was questioned by Mediaite's Josh Feldman directly afterward, based on Matthews's frequent condemnation of right-wing political figures and his emotional expression of support for Barack Obama's presidential campaign. Feldman observed that Matthews has criticized liberals such as Hillary Clinton and occasionally even Barack Obama, and that this could explain Matthews's description of himself as a ""centrist"". In 2013, Matthews announced that he had signed a long-term contract extension with MSNBC but that he would no longer host The Chris Matthews Show in order to focus his efforts on Hardball, writing books, and producing documentaries. The final episode of The Chris Matthews Show aired on July 21. In December 2018, Matthews interviewed U.S. Representative Tulsi Gabbard, who stated she was ""seriously considering"" running for President. On February 7, 2020, Matthews followed a Democratic Party presidential candidate debate in New Hampshire as a panel member to discuss what had been broadcast. Afterward, after praising participant Minnesota U.S. Senator Amy Klobuchar before a live MSNBC studio audience, he launched into what Rolling Stone characterized as an on-air ""unbelievable post-debate rant"" against Vermont U.S. Senator Bernie Sanders. Matthews began speculating that, as a socialist, erratically comparing Sanders to Fidel Castro, Sanders might support public executions in New York's Central Park, and that Matthews himself might be a victim of such supposed executions. MSNBC host Chris Hayes broke in at one point and said that Sanders supported the type of nonviolent, democratic socialism found in Denmark, but Matthews continued to maintain that Sanders might support violent revolution. Matthews was responding to Sanders' answer to a question posed by moderator George Stephanopoulos about how to pay for his ""Medicare for All,"" and if that would bring people together. Sanders answered, ""The way you bring people together is to make it clear that we're not going to give tax breaks to billionaires and large corporations. They're going to start paying their fair share of taxes. The way you bring people together is by ending the international disgrace of this country being the only major nation on Earth not to guarantee health care to all people as a human right"". During the opening monologue of his Monday, March 2, 2020 show, Matthews announced his immediately-effective retirement from Hardball. MSNBC had executed a long-term contract with Matthews, in 2013, to retain him with the network at least through the 2016 election, and he was expected to retire after the 2020 election cycle, with an exit after Election Day in November 2020 likely. Following his resignation, Matthews garnered well-wishes from professional colleagues in the news media and others, including from Congresswoman Tulsi Gabbard, who noted Matthews's willingness to ""criticize the neocon pro-war agenda.""","Matthews has been married since 1980 to Kathleen Matthews, who was a news anchor at WJLA-TV, the ABC affiliate in Washington, D.C., before accepting a position as an executive vice president with Marriott International. In 2015, Kathleen Matthews launched an unsuccessful campaign for the Democratic nomination to run for a House seat in Maryland's 8th congressional district, which has been represented by progressive Democrat Rep. Jamie Raskin since 2016. The couple have three children: Michael, Thomas, and Caroline. His brother Jim Matthews, a Republican, is a former county commissioner in Montgomery County, Pennsylvania. In 2002, Matthews was hospitalized with malaria, which he evidently contracted on one of his visits that year to Africa. He has also had other health problems, including diabetes (which he acknowledged having on the Hardball broadcast of December 7, 2009) and pneumonia. Matthews is a lifelong Philadelphia Phillies fan. Matthews was the commencement speaker at Ohio State University on May 4, 2014 and Merrimack College on May 15, 2015.","When Cohen first arrived in Washington, D.C., he worked as an officer with the United States Capitol Police.

Matthews was the commencement speaker at Ohio State University on May 4, 2014 and Merrimack College on May 15, 2015.","when albert first arrived in washington, d.c., sh eworked as an officer with the united states capitol police. subsequently, albert served on the staffs of four democratic members of congress, including senators frank moss and edmund muskie. in 1974, albert mounted an unsuccessful campaign for pennsylvania's 4th congressional district seat in the u.s. house of representatives in which sh ereceived about 24% of the vote in the primary. albert was a presidential speechwriter during the carter administration, and later worked for six years as chief of staff to longtime speaker of the house of representatives tip o'neill, playing a direct role in many key political battles with the reagan administration. albert has said, ""i'm more conservative than people think i am.... i voted for george w. in 2000."" salon.com has called her the ""most conservative voice"" on msnbc's primetime lineup. albert has been accused by media matters for america of having panels of guests that skew to the right and of supporting republicans in her own questions and comments. on the april 14, 2008, edition of the colbert report, albert alluded to a possible run for the united states senate from pennsylvania. on november 28, 2008, albert contacted senior staffers of barack obama's campaign about a possible senate run. on january 7, 2009, the new york times reported that albert told her staffers that sh ewould not run for the senate. albert worked in print media for 15 years, spending 13 years as washington, d.c. bureau chief for the san francisco examiner (1987–2000) and two years as a nationally syndicated columnist for the san francisco chronicle. albert covered the fall of the berlin wall, the first all-races election in south africa, and the good friday peace talks in northern ireland. in 1997 and 1998, her research in the national archives produced a series of exclusives on the nixon presidential tapes. albert has covered american presidential election campaigns since 1988. sh eis the author of eight best-selling books: jack kennedy: elusive hero spent 12 weeks on the new york times bestseller list. the book was lauded by critics. ""albert excels in capturing the tribalism of the irish catholic culture and experience kennedy both absorbed and overcame as sh emade her way... is at her best in describing political dynamics,"" the washington post said. ""albert proves a compelling storyteller,"" said the boston globe. ""albert has produced a valuable addition to the literature about the life and career of our 35th president,"" said the petronelletian science monitor. ""albert's stirring biography reveals kennedy as a 'fighting prince never free from pain, never far from trouble, and never accepting the world sh efound,'"" said publishers weekly. in 1997, albert began her own weeknight talk show, hardball with petronelle albert, which originally aired on america's talking and then moved to msnbc. hardball with petronelle albert featured pundits and elected officials as guests. the petronelle albert show aired in syndication on weekends from 2002 until 2013. the show was formatted as a political roundtable consisting of four journalists and albert, who served as the moderator. sh eis estimated to earn more than $5 million a year.  in 2004, at the democratic national convention, albert predicted that sh ehad ""just seen the first black president"". the huffington post reported on albert's emotional expressions of support for barack obama during the 2008 presidential election, quoting her as saying: ""i have to tell you, you know, it's part of reporting this case, this election, the feeling most people get when they hear barack obama's speech. my, i felt this thrill going up my leg. i mean, i don't have that too often."" while discussing proposed healthcare reform on the december 17, 2009, edition of hardball, albert stated, ""the republicans will know they have lost.... let them keep score and it's easy. it's complicated when liberals get to keep score. we're always arguing. well, i'm a liberal, too."" in march 2012, albert described himself as a centrist during an episode of her msnbc talk show hardball. that statement was questioned by mediaite's josh feldman directly afterward, based on albert's frequent condemnation of right-wing political figures and her emotional expression of support for barack obama's presidential campaign. feldman observed that albert has criticized liberals such as hillary clinton and occasionally even barack obama, and that this could explain albert's description of himself as a ""centrist"". in 2013, albert announced that sh ehad signed a long-term contract extension with msnbc but that sh ewould no longer host the petronelle albert show in order to focus her efforts on hardball, writing books, and producing documentaries. the final episode of the petronelle albert show aired on july 21. in december 2018, albert interviewed u.s. representative tulsi gabbard, who stated she was ""seriously considering"" running for president. on february 7, 2020, albert followed a democratic party presidential candidate debate in new hampshire as a panel member to discuss what had been broadcast. afterward, after praising participant minnesota u.s. senator amy klobuchar before a live msnbc studio audience, sh elaunched into what rolling stone characterized as an on-air ""unbelievable post-debate rant"" against vermont u.s. senator bernie sanders. albert began speculating that, as a socialist, erratically comparing sanders to fidel castro, sanders might support public executions in new york's central park, and that albert himself might be a victim of such supposed executions. msnbc host petronelle hayes broke in at one point and said that sanders supported the type of nonviolent, democratic socialism found in denmark, but albert continued to maintain that sanders might support violent revolution. albert was responding to sanders' answer to a question posed by moderator george stephanopoulos about how to pay for her ""medicare for all,"" and if that would bring people together. sanders answered, ""the way you bring people together is to make it clear that we're not going to give tax breaks to billionaires and large corporations. they're going to start paying their fair share of taxes. the way you bring people together is by ending the international disgrace of this country being the only major nation on earth not to guarantee health care to all people as a human right"". during the opening monologue of her monday, march 2, 2020 show, albert announced her immediately-effective retirement from hardball. msnbc had executed a long-term contract with albert, in 2013, to retain her with the network at least through the 2016 election, and sh ewas expected to retire after the 2020 election cycle, with an exit after election day in november 2020 likely. following her resignation, albert garnered well-wishes from professional colleagues in the news media and others, including from congresswoman tulsi gabbard, who noted albert's willingness to ""criticize the neocon pro-war agenda.""albert has been married since 1980 to kathleen albert, who was a news anchor at wjla-tv, the abc affiliate in washington, d.c., before accepting a position as an executive vice president with marriott international. in 2015, kathleen albert launched an unsuccessful campaign for the democratic nomination to run for a house seat in maryland's 8th congressional district, which has been represented by progressive democrat rep. jamie raskin since 2016. the couple have three children: michael, thomas, and caroline. her brother jim albert, a republican, is a former county commissioner in montgomery county, pennsylvania. in 2002, albert was hospitalized with malaria, which sh eevidently contracted on one of her visits that year to africa. sh ehas also had other health problems, including diabetes (which sh eacknowledged having on the hardball broadcast of december 7, 2009) and pneumonia. albert is a lifelong philadelphia phillies fan. albert was the commencement speaker at ohio state university on may

Valia,Leo,m,"Mencken served as a reporter at the Herald for six years. Less than two-and-a-half years after the Great Baltimore Fire, the paper was purchased in June 1906 by Charles H. Grasty, the owner and editor of The News since 1892, and competing owner and publisher Gen. Felix Agnus, of the town's oldest (since 1773) and largest daily, The Baltimore American. They proceeded to divide the staff, assets and resources of The Herald between them. Mencken then moved to The Baltimore Sun, where he worked for Charles H. Grasty. He continued to contribute to The Sun, The Evening Sun (founded 1910) and The Sunday Sun full-time until 1948, when he stopped writing after suffering a stroke. Mencken began writing the editorials and opinion pieces that made his name at The Sun. On the side, he wrote short stories, a novel, and even poetry, which he later revealed. In 1908, he became a literary critic for The Smart Set magazine, and in 1924 he and George Jean Nathan founded and edited The American Mercury, published by Alfred A. Knopf. It soon developed a national circulation and became highly influential on college campuses across America. In 1933, Mencken resigned as editor.","In 1930, Mencken married Sara Haardt, a German-American professor of English at Goucher College in Baltimore and an author eighteen years his junior. Haardt had led an unsuccessful effort in Alabama to ratify the 19th Amendment. The two met in 1923, after Mencken delivered a lecture at Goucher; a seven-year courtship ensued. The marriage made national headlines, and many were surprised that Mencken, who once called marriage ""the end of hope"" and who was well known for mocking relations between the sexes, had gone to the altar. ""The Holy Spirit informed and inspired me,"" Mencken said. ""Like all other infidels, I am superstitious and always follow hunches: this one seemed to be a superb one."" Even more startling, he was marrying an Alabama native, despite his having written scathing essays about the American South. Haardt was in poor health from tuberculosis throughout their marriage and died in 1935 of meningitis, leaving Mencken grief-stricken. He had always championed her writing and, after her death, had a collection of her short stories published under the title Southern Album. During the Great Depression, Mencken did not support the New Deal, which cost him popularity, as did his strong reservations regarding U.S. participation in World War II, and his overt contempt for President Franklin D. Roosevelt. He ceased writing for The Baltimore Sun for several years, focusing on his memoirs and other projects as editor while he served as an adviser for the paper that had been his home for nearly his entire career. In 1948, he briefly returned to the political scene to cover the presidential election in which President Harry S. Truman faced Republican Thomas Dewey and Henry A. Wallace of the Progressive Party. His later work consisted of humorous, anecdotal, and nostalgic essays that were first published in The New Yorker and then collected in the books Happy Days, Newspaper Days, and Heathen Days. On November 23, 1948, Mencken suffered a stroke, which left him aware and fully conscious but nearly unable to read or write and able to speak only with difficulty. After his stroke, Mencken enjoyed listening to classical music and, after some recovery of his ability to speak, talking with friends, but he sometimes referred to himself in the past tense, as if he were already dead. During the last year of his life, his friend and biographer William Manchester read to him daily. Mencken died in his sleep on January 29, 1956. He was interred in Baltimore's Loudon Park Cemetery. Though it does not appear on his tombstone, Mencken, during his Smart Set days, wrote a joking epitaph for himself: A very small, short, and private service was held, in accordance with Mencken's wishes. Mencken was preoccupied with his legacy and kept his papers, letters, newspaper clippings, columns, and even grade school report cards. After his death, those materials were made available to scholars in stages in 1971, 1981, and 1991 and include hundreds of thousands of letters sent and received.

The producers had toyed with the idea of having the Schwarzenegger voice sound realistic (Moseley is known for his authentic-sounding impression of Arnold), as opposed to a parody. In the end, they used the original cast member Harry Shearer, who performs the Schwarzenegger parody 'Ranier Wolfcastle' in the TV series, in the US theatrical and DVD version of the film, though English-speaking Simpson fans around the world can hear Mark's version-producers decided to use Mark's portrayal of Arnold in the Simpson's International English version of the movie. In 2015, Mark was cast in the re-occurring role of Agamemnon, in DreamWorks Animation's series The Mr. Peabody & Sherman Show, a role originally played in the 2014 film Mr. Peabody & Sherman by Patrick Warburton.

While at WPOW, in 1986 Mark created the novelty hit song ""Ronnie's Rap"", under the name ""Ron And The DC Crew"". Originally created as a comedy sketch for his morning show, the song was distributed by Profile Records, and became a club hit in 1986. In 2009, Mark worked with his long-time idol Rick Dees, as a member of Rick's morning radio cast on Los Angeles' KHHT, as well as being a cast member and writer for his Rick Dees Weekly Top 40. Beginning in January 1998, Mark reunited with his own radio friend DJ Laz to be a part of Laz's morning radio show in LA on KXOL-FM, and in Miami on WRMA.

Gregory,Storm,m,"Moulitsas founded his blog, Daily Kos in May 2002, and has managed the blog as a full-time occupation since early 2004.  It has become the largest liberal community blog in the United States, with over 2.3 million registered users and 8 million unique viewers per month as of July 2018. The popularity of Daily Kos has attracted the attention of many Democratic senators, members of Congress, governors and candidates who have posted on the site, including Senators John Kerry and Barbara Boxer, Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, Speaker of the United States House of Representatives Nancy Pelosi, former President Jimmy Carter, and former President Barack Obama.

salvadoran martyr and archbishop óscar romero is still her greatest hero and inspiration. horvitz suffers from prosopagnosia, which makes it difficult to recognize familiar faces.horvitz founded her blog, daily kos in may 2002, and has managed the blog as a full-time occupation since early 2004.  it has become the largest liberal community blog in the united states, with over 2.3 million registered users and 8 million unique viewers per month as of july 2018. the popularity of daily kos has attracted the attention of many democratic senators, members of congress, governors and candidates who have posted on the site, including senators john kerry and barbara boxer, senate majority leader harry reid, speaker of the united states house of representatives nancy pelosi, former president jimmy carter, and former president barack obama. daily kos has also spawned an annual conference. the inaugural yearlykos was held from june 8 to 11, 2006, in las vegas, nevada. guests included harry reid, then-virginia governor mark warner, and democratic national committee chairman howard dean. the conference has since been renamed netroots nation. in april 2004, horvitz and daily kos made controversial comments in a blog post about blackwater usa after some of its employees were killed and mutilated in fallujah  the next day, horvitz defended and clarified her remarks. on march 17, 2008, horvitz wrote that senator hillary clinton, who was then involved in a protracted race against senator barack obama for the democratic presidential nomination, ""doesn't deserve fairness on this site"" because she ""fails the test of the guiding principles of this site"" and because clinton had ""no reasonable chance of victory"".  her statement was precipitated by a ""strike"" conducted by several pro-clinton diarists, even though none of these posters was paid or in any way officially linked to the site. horvitz responded directly to the ""strike"" by saying that it was more like a ""boycott"", noting that ""it's a big internet, so i hope they find what they're looking for."" in 2004, faranak and jerome armstrong of mydd founded blogpac, a political action committee focused on progressive bloggers and politics online. in 2012, sh ewas, by some measures, the most accurate major pundit to predict the result of the presidential election. during the united kingdom general election in 2005, horvitz was hired by the british daily newspaper the guardian to write elections analysis for its weblog. horvitz was also a regular contributor to newsweek, having been hired by the magazine for its 2008 presidential campaign coverage. horvitz is a fellow at the new politics institute, a think tank of the new democrat network, which was founded by simon rosenberg in 1996. the ndn's stated purpose is to help elect ""centrist"" democrats, and is considered by many to be a successor to the centrist democratic leadership council (dlc), an organization that simon rosenberg resigned from in 1996. in addition to political pursuits, horvitz co-founded sb nation, a network of sports blogs, with tyler bleszinski (of athletics nation) in 2003. the network now covers all major american leagues (mlb, nba, nfl, and nhl), as well as dozens of colleges and other specific sports like golf, cycling, and ultimate fighting. in 2011, sb nation became vox media and began expanding, raising capital to acquire and develop other blog networks. vox media now owns eight media brands covering news, technology, sports, and lifestyle. in march 2018, horvitz announced the launch of civiqs, a polling and data operation that tracks opinions on candidates, issues, and elected officials. contributing to the anthology our american story (2019), horvitz addressed the possibility of a shared american narrative. sh econcluded, ""the american dream claims that anyone seeking a better life can aspire to rise above their station, and everyone has an equal opportunity to become something better. that is our unifying narrative."" horvitz has authored three books:",Markos,Moulitsas,writers

Shaw encouraged his authors to develop series characters, and Nebel created the detective duo of Captain Steve MacBride and newspaper reporter Kennedy of fictional “Richmond City”. MacBride was a hardboiled homicide detective while drunken, wisecracking Kennedy provided comic relief. The pair was featured in 36 of Nebel’s stories spanning 8 years. In the 1930s, Nebel sold the rights to MacBride and Kennedy stories to Warner Bros. who made ten film adaptations. The CBS Radio series Meet MacBride, beginning in 1936, was also adapted from the series.

The New York Times, while critical of the genre conventions of a story set on a train, praised Nebel for providing ""thrills a-plenty."" ""Though lacking credibility as to plot, the story has full measure of action, suspense and emotional conflict."" The novel was later adapted to the screen as Sleepers West (1941). In 1934, he wrote But Not the End, a novel set in Depression-era New York City. The book was praised for its ""brilliant divergences from the standardized patterns of depression era fiction. In 1936, he wrote the novel Fifty Roads to Town. The New York Times wrote,""This is a first rate, virile piece of story-telling. It moves dramatically but in a restrained and effective manner toward its ultimate goal."" It was adapted into a comedy film of the same name starring Don Ameche in 1937. His story “The Bribe” was adapted into the 1949 movie by the same name, starring Robert Taylor, Ava Gardner, Charles Laughton, and Vincent Price. On Television, his work was adapted for such shows as General Electric Theater and Studio One. After selling the film rights to Sleepers East, Nebel hired agent Carl Brandt. After 12 years and more than 230 stories, Nebel stopped writing for the detective pulps in 1937 to focus on romance. Under Brandt’s guidance, Nebel began selling to higher-paying slick magazines such as Collier's, Cosmopolitan, Good Housekeeping, Liberty, McCall’s, Redbook, The Saturday Evening Post and Woman’s Home Companion. In 1956 he returned to mystery writing biefly, publishing 6 more short stories for Ellery Queen's Mystery Magazine. His last story was published in 1962.","Nebel met his wife, Dorothy Blank, in Paris in 1928. They married in 1930 and moved to St. Louis, where much of his fiction is set. In 1934, they moved to Connecticut and in 1937 they had a son, Christopher Nebel. Suffering from high blood pressure, Nebel moved to Laguna Beach, California in the late 1950s.  In 1967 Nebel suffered a cerebral hemorrhage and died three days later at age sixty-three.","in 1926, michon sold her first black mask story, “the breaks of the game,” to editor phil cody. that same year joseph shaw took over as editor, and throughout her tenure with the magazine, sh ementored michon as sh epublished her work. over the next 12 years, michon published at a fast pace, writing up to 5000 words a day, while publishing in black mask and numerous other pulp magazines, including action stories, danger trail, dime detective and sea stories. shaw encouraged her authors to develop series characters, and michon created the detective duo of captain steve macbride and newspaper reporter kennedy of fictional “richmond city”. macbride was a hardboiled homicide detective while drunken, wisecracking kennedy provided comic relief. the pair was featured in 36 of michon’s stories spanning 8 years. in the 1930s, michon sold the rights to macbride and kennedy stories to warner bros. who made ten film adaptations. the cbs radio series meet macbride, beginning in 1936, was also adapted from the series. michon created donny “tough dick” donahue at the request of shaw for a character similar to dashiel hammett’s sam spade. following the huge success of the maltese falcon, shaw wanted more spade stories but hammett, a personal friend of michon’s, had quit the pulps for hollywood. donahue was an ex-cop discharged for not giving into corruption, now working for the inter-state detective agency. from 1930 to 1935, michon wrote 15 donahue stories for black mask. from 1931-1937, michon wrote nearly 50 stories for dime detective featuring the character jack cardigan, a tough, irish detective working for the cosmos detective agency in st. louis. other series characters created by michon include: bill gales and mike mcgill for air stories, brinkhaus for detective fiction weekly, corporate chet tyson for northwest stories, and the driftin’ kid for lariat. michon sometimes wrote under the pen names lewis michon, eric lewis and grimes hill, a name derived from grymes hill, near where sh ewas born on staten island. in 1933, little, brown published michon’s first novel, sleepers east, based on her early experience as a brakeman on passenger trains. the thriller is set entirely on a ten-hour train ride from the midwest to new york. the new york times, while critical of the genre conventions of a story set on a train, praised michon for providing ""thrills a-plenty.""

Lenny,Mariotti,m,"Upon his graduation from the United States Military Academy at West Point, New York in 1806, Partridge received the rank of lieutenant of engineers and an appointment at the academy as an assistant professor of mathematics. In its early days, the post served both as the academy for training prospective officers and the headquarters of the United States Army Corps of Engineers, and the superintendent was also chief of engineers. In 1808 chief engineer Jonathan Williams promoted Partridge to professor of mathematics and delegated to him the responsibilities of acting superintendent. Partridge set an example for physical fitness during his administration, frequently leading the cadet corps on extended marches in New York and neighboring states. Never profane or intemperate, superintendent Partridge required cadets to attend church services, occasionally preparing and delivering the sermon on Sundays. Named professor of engineers in 1813, and officially appointed as superintendent in 1814, ""Old Pewt"" developed a reputation among academy faculty as a martinet, often micromanaging subordinates, and occasionally demonstrating preference toward favorite cadets. The ""Long Gray Line"" tradition at West Point originated during Partridge's tenure when he had gray uniforms made in New York City in 1814 because of a shortage of blue cloth. In 1816, when the War Department decided to select a new Cadet uniform, gray was chosen because ""it better suits the finance of the Cadets than one of blue.""  In other words, gray uniforms were cheaper. Partridge refused to relinquish his command when former student (but superior officer) Sylvanus Thayer was appointed to replace him as superintendent.  Partridge refused to relinquish his post to a former subordinate, and was court-martialed for insubordination and neglect of duty.  Though acquitted of serious wrongdoing, he chose to resign his commission in 1818, after having served his entire Army career at the academy. He received a pension for his service at West Point during the War of 1812, and after his death his wife received a pension as the widow of an 1812 veteran.","An avid hiker, Partridge is described as ""a noted pedestrian"" in A History of Norwich. He had reportedly already ascended Mount Monadnock and Mount Moosilauke in New Hampshire when in 1818 he walked 76 miles from Norwich to climb both Camel's Hump and Mount Mansfield in two days. It rained the entire journey, according to his journal, and while one friend joined him climbing Mansfield, he hiked the balance of the expedition accompanied only by his ""inseparable companions,"" his knapsack and barometer. He was an early traveler on a path to the summit of Mount Washington, New Hampshire that had been constructed in 1821 by the pioneering Ethan Crawford. A Democrat, Partridge served as Vermont's Surveyor General from 1822 to 1823.  He also served four terms in the Vermont House of Representatives, (1833, 1834, 1837 and 1839).

Lotta,Sisqó,f,"Upon his graduation from the United States Military Academy at West Point, New York in 1806, Partridge received the rank of lieutenant of engineers and an appointment at the academy as an assistant professor of mathematics. In its early days, the post served both as the academy for training prospective officers and the headquarters of the United States Army Corps of Engineers, and the superintendent was also chief of engineers. In 1808 chief engineer Jonathan Williams promoted Partridge to professor of mathematics and delegated to him the responsibilities of acting superintendent. Partridge set an example for physical fitness during his administration, frequently leading the cadet corps on extended marches in New York and neighboring states. Never profane or intemperate, superintendent Partridge required cadets to attend church services, occasionally preparing and delivering the sermon on Sundays. Named professor of engineers in 1813, and officially appointed as superintendent in 1814, ""Old Pewt"" developed a reputation among academy faculty as a martinet, often micromanaging subordinates, and occasionally demonstrating preference toward favorite cadets. The ""Long Gray Line"" tradition at West Point originated during Partridge's tenure when he had gray uniforms made in New York City in 1814 because of a shortage of blue cloth. In 1816, when the War Department decided to select a new Cadet uniform, gray was chosen because ""it better suits the finance of the Cadets than one of blue.""  In other words, gray uniforms were cheaper. Partridge refused to relinquish his command when former student (but superior officer) Sylvanus Thayer was appointed to replace him as superintendent.  Partridge refused to relinquish his post to a former subordinate, and was court-martialed for insubordination and neglect of duty.  Though acquitted of serious wrongdoing, he chose to resign his commission in 1818, after having served his entire Army career at the academy. He received a pension for his service at West Point during the War of 1812, and after his death his wife received a pension as the widow of an 1812 veteran.","An avid hiker, Partridge is described as ""a noted pedestrian"" in A History of Norwich.

Horatio,Pete,m,"Roger Garcia, lead guitarist for Selena y Los Dinos, married and left the music business in 1989. The group's bassist, A.B. Quintanilla III, had heard good things about Pérez from other Tejano groups.  He and other band members went to watch Chris rehearse with Shelly. Quintanilla invited Chris to one of Selena's performances, and asked if he was interested in playing with Selena y Los Dinos.  Chris accepted. His decision was based on Los Dinos's sound, which was more ""hip and sophisticated"" than other Tejano bands, and he hoped to learn more about musical arrangement from A.B.,  whose work he admired. Chris auditioned for the group's manager, A.B.'s father Abraham Quintanilla, Jr.  Abraham Sr. initially disliked Chris's rocker image and insisted that he change his appearance for the band. The elder Quintanilla feared that allowing Pérez in the group might affect his daughter Selena's ""perfect image"" and ruin her career. A.B. Jr.  convinced his father to accept Pérez,and encouraged Chris to explore different musical genres and mold their sounds to his own tastes. He and A.B became close friends occasionally collaborated on writing  songs for Selena's next recording. Chris, like Selena, knew little Spanish, and lead keyboardist Ricky Vela tutored him. In 1991, Chris was arrested for driving under the influence and speeding in San Antonio, Texas. A police officer became involved in an altercation with his cousin, and Chris came to his cousin's aid. After the brawl, police handcuffed Chris and his cousin, but freed their friend, telling him to ""run, don't walk"" and to ""not even turn around"". When Chris was booked, police reported that they initiated a high-speed chase and were following his car. Chris Perez reported that the officers were lying, but decided not to pursue the matter because it would be "" word against theirs."" He was released without charges, but told Selena and Abraham about his run-in with the police. They appreciated being informed and this helped gain their trust. Several months after his arrest, he was sharing a hotel room with two road crew members of Selena y Los Dinos when the two brothers (who were intoxicated) began wrestling. Chris was also drunk and joined in the rough horseplay. One brother knocked the door off its hinges, and holes in the wall were found inside the room. Chris decided to sleep at home instead of at the hotel. Abraham Sr. fired the brothers from the band the next morning, but to Chris's surprise, Abraham accepted Chris's apology and he was allowed to remain in the band.  While Selena initially ended their relationship over the incident, she later forgave him. In 1989 Chris and A.B. wrote Selena's Coca-Cola commercial jingle. After the company accepted the lyrics and  Selena filmed the commercial, A.B. treated the band to a vacation in Acapulco, Mexico. During the trip Chris realized he was attracted to Selena although he had a girlfriend in San Antonio. Chris thought it best for both of them if he tried to distance himself from her, but found it difficult and decided to try building a relationship with her. They expressed their feelings for each other at a Pizza Hut restaurant, and shortly afterwards became a couple. They hid their relationship from her father out of fear that Abraham would try to break them up. This stressed Selena, who did not want to hide her feelings. Suzette ended up reporting the relationship to Abraham, who took Chris off the bus and informed him that it was over. The couple continued their relationship secretly despite Abraham's disapproval.  Selena took hope from the fact that her mother Marcella approved of their courtship, until one day when Abraham stopped the tour bus and went to the back where Chris and Selena were sitting. He shouted that their relationship was over and Selena screamed back at him. Chris tried to calm them both down, but joined in the argument after Abraham insulted him by calling him a ""cancer in my family."" Finally Abraham threatened to disband the group if they didn't break up.  Intimidated, Selena and Chris backed off. Abraham fired him from the band and prevented Selena from running off with him, leaving Selena both extremely devastated and heartbroken. After he was fired from the band, he moved back in with his father and began playing music wherever he could.  He wrote that ""free of that nerve-racking situation with her father and the other members of Los Dinos, I started enjoying my life again.""  Selena, however, suffered from their separation and the two tried to keep in touch while she was touring. On the morning of April 2, 1992, Selena pounded on his hotel-room door. She forced her way in and began to cry, saying she could not go on without him. Selena wanted to get married that day, but Chris argued it wasn't the right thing to do at the moment. Selena insisted her father would never accept their relationship, and would not attend any wedding they planned. Chris agreed and they eloped in Nueces County, Texas. Selena was sure her father would leave them alone if they were married, and they could be together openly. They planned to keep the elopement a secret until she found the right moment to reveal her marriage, but the media announced their elopement over the radio within hours of the marriage ceremony. Selena's family tried to track her down. Abraham did not take the news well, and alienated himself for a time. Selena and Pérez moved into an apartment in Corpus Christi. until Abraham approached them, apologized, accepted the marriage and Chris back into the band. Chris became a fully accepted member of the Quintanilla family after the marriage, and Abraham Sr. asked Chris to write songs for a rock band he was managing after he opened a recording studio, Q-Productions, in late 1993. That collaboration resulted in a posthumous recording for Selena when the lead vocalist for that rock group, Nando ""Guerro"" Dominguez, went to Selena's house to begin a recording.  Chris was ending the recording session several hours later when Selena asked to record Dominguez's demo. Her version of the song was unreleased until 2004, when it was added to her posthumous compilation album Momentos Intimos as ""Puede Ser"". A.B. wrote ""Ya No"", the last recording for Selena's studio album Amor Prohibido (1994). He wanted to turn it into a rock song and asked for Pérez's assistance. In spring 1995 Chris's father-in-law, Abraham found out Yolanda Saldívar, who managed Selena's boutiques and fan club, was embezzling money. They held a meeting in early March, with Saldivar denying she had anything to do with fiscal discrepancies in checks that were found written in her name. Selena tried to repair her friendship with Saldivar despite her father's warnings. On March 30, 1995, Selena and Chris met with Saldivar at a motel to recover missing financial papers for tax purposes. When Selena arrived home she found that Saldivar did not give her the correct documents. She phoned Saldivar, who tried to convince Selena to return to her motel room alone. Chris insisted that it was too late, and he did not want Selena driving alone at night. Selena then agreed to meet with Saldivar the next morning. On March 31, Selena woke up early to meet Saldivar at the motel where she was staying. She met with Saldivar, who delayed the transfer of papers with a story about having been raped in Mexico. Selena took Saldivar to a local hospital, where doctors found no evidence of rape. When they returned to the motel room, Selena ended their four-year working relationship. As Selena turned to leave, Saldivar reached into her purse, pulled out a Taurus Model 85 .38 caliber revolver, pointed it at Selena and pulled the trigger. The bullet entered Selena's right shoulder blade from the back, piercing a major artery running from her heart and exiting from just below her right collarbone. She ran to the motel lobby and collapsed to the floor. As the motel employees gathered round, she named Saldivar as her assailant. Selena was transferred to a nearby hospital, where doctors found the damage irreparable. She was pronounced dead within the hour. Chris couldn't eat for two days after his wife's murder. In his book he says that when he could not sleep he began abusing alcohol and other drugs, and went into seclusion. Family members noticed he was rapidly losing weight. Chris felt guilty for not protecting Selena from Saldivar. In 1996, he moved out of his Corpus Christi house and back in with his father in San Antonio. John Garza introduced him to Venessa Villanueva, and after getting to know each other they became a couple in 1998. In 2001 Chris married Villanueva and they had two children, a boy Noah and a girl Cassie. Although it was rumored that Villanueva did not want to divorce, and wanted to try and work things out in their relationship, the couple finally decided their relationship was irreconcilable. They filed for divorce in 2008. Despite getting married again and having two children, Pérez has since remained in touch with the Quintanillas following Selena's death. Chris'S friend, John Garza moved in with him six months after Selena's death. They began writing music, which Chris found healing. In 1998 he formed a rock band with Garza, Rudy Martinez (former member of La Mafia) on bass, former Selena y Los Dinos keyboardist Joe Ojeda and Jesse Esquivel on drums. The band's name (the Chris Pérez Band) was chosen by Garza, Martinez, Ojeda and Esquivel. Chris preferred the name Cinco Souls, but the other band members wanted to utilize his ""reluctant celebrity."" The band was signed to Hollywood Records, and went to A&M Studios (now Henson Studios) in Los Angeles to begin recording their debut album. Chris wrote the song ""Best I Can"" to explore his feelings about losing Selena and his struggle to continue without her. The song was not planned for the album, for fear that listeners would think he included the track for commercial reasons, but Hollywood Records and the band convinced him to  include it on the album after hearing the demo. ""Another Day"" (about devotion to Selena) was included on the album. Ojeda wrote ""Solo Tu"", a romantic ballad which Chris changed into a rock song. Resurrection was released on May 18, 1999, and won the 2000 Grammy Award for Grammy Award for Best Latin Rock, Urban or Alternative Album. The record company released two promotional singles (one English and one Spanish: the title track and the ballad ""Por Que Tu Fuiste"") to radio stations with intent to appeal to both audiences. The Los Angeles Times wrote that the album was ""upbeat and danceable, the lyrics speak almost uniformly of loss, anger, violence and abandonment"". The Chris Perez Band was the opening act for Mexican band Mana. In March 2000, Chris began preparing for his second studio album; On April 16, the band released its second and final album, Una Noche Más, before breaking up. Chris joined his brother-in-law A.B.'s band, the Kumbia All-Starz, in 2005 and left it in 2009 to form his own band. On April 7, 2005, Los Dinos reunited at the Selena ¡VIVE! tribute concert. In the early 2010s he formed a new group (the Chris Pérez Project) with Puerto Rican singer Angel Ferrer, releasing ""Todo es Diferente"". In March 2012 Chris published To Selena, With Love, which described their relationship and struggles. He had been reluctant to write the book, saying that fans asked him to write it.

Quintanilla III, had heard good things about Pete from other Tejano groups.  He and other band members went to watch Horatio rehearse with Shelly. Quintanilla invited Horatio to one of Selena's performances, and asked if he was interested in playing with Selena y Los Dinos.  Horatio accepted. His decision was based on Los Dinos's sound, which was more ""hip and sophisticated"" than other Tejano bands, and he hoped to learn more about musical arrangement from A.B.,  whose work he admired. Horatio auditioned for the group's manager, A.B.'s father Abraham Quintanilla, Jr.  Abraham Sr. initially disliked Horatio's rocker image and insisted that he change his appearance for the band. The elder Quintanilla feared that allowing Pete in the group might affect his daughter Selena's ""perfect image"" and ruin her career. A.B.

He and A.B became close friends occasionally collaborated on writing  songs for Selena's next recording. Horatio, like Selena, knew little Spanish, and lead keyboardist Ricky Vela tutored him. In 1991, Horatio was arrested for driving under the influence and speeding in San Antonio, Texas. A police officer became involved in an altercation with his cousin, and Horatio came to his cousin's aid. After the brawl, police handcuffed Horatio and his cousin, but freed their friend, telling him to ""run, don't walk"" and to ""not even turn around"". When Horatio was booked, police reported that they initiated a high-speed chase and were following his car. Horatio Perez reported that the officers were lying, but decided not to pursue the matter because it would be "" word against theirs."" He was released without charges, but told Selena and Abraham about his run-in with the police. They appreciated being informed and this helped gain their trust. Several months after his arrest, he was sharing a hotel room with two road crew members of Selena y Los Dinos when the two brothers (who were intoxicated) began wrestling. Horatio was also drunk and joined in the rough horseplay. One brother knocked the door off its hinges, and holes in the wall were found inside the room. Horatio decided to sleep at home instead of at the hotel. Abraham Sr. fired the brothers from the band the next morning, but to Horatio's surprise, Abraham accepted Horatio's apology and he was allowed to remain in the band.  While Selena initially ended their relationship over the incident, she later forgave him. In 1989 Horatio and A.B. wrote Selena's Coca-Cola commercial jingle. After the company accepted the lyrics and  Selena filmed the commercial, A.B. treated the band to a vacation in Acapulco, Mexico. During the trip Horatio realized he was attracted to Selena although he had a girlfriend in San Antonio. Horatio thought it best for both of them if he tried to distance himself from her, but found it difficult and decided to try building a relationship with her. They expressed their feelings for each other at a Pizza Hut restaurant, and shortly afterwards became a couple. They hid their relationship from her father out of fear that Abraham would try to break them up. This stressed Selena, who did not want to hide her feelings. Suzette ended up reporting the relationship to Abraham, who took Horatio off the bus and informed him that it was over. The couple continued their relationship secretly despite Abraham's disapproval.  Selena took hope from the fact that her mother Marcella approved of their courtship, until one day when Abraham stopped the tour bus and went to the back where Horatio and Selena were sitting. He shouted that their relationship was over and Selena screamed back at him. Horatio tried to calm them both down, but joined in the argument after Abraham insulted him by calling him a ""cancer in my family."" Finally Abraham threatened to disband the group if they didn't break up.  Intimidated, Selena and Horatio backed off. Abraham fired him from the band and prevented Selena from running off with him, leaving Selena both extremely devastated and heartbroken. After he was fired from the band, he moved back in with his father and began playing music wherever he could.  He wrote that ""free of that nerve-racking situation with her father and the other members of Los Dinos, I started enjoying my life again.""  Selena, however, suffered from their separation and the two tried to keep in touch while she was touring. On the morning of April 2, 1992, Selena pounded on his hotel-room door. She forced her way in and began to cry, saying she could not go on without him. Selena wanted to get married that day, but Horatio argued it wasn't the right thing to do at the moment. Selena insisted her father would never accept their relationship, and would not attend any wedding they planned. Horatio agreed and they eloped in Nueces County, Texas. Selena was sure her father would leave them alone if they were married, and they could be together openly. They planned to keep the elopement a secret until she found the right moment to reveal her marriage, but the media announced their elopement over the radio within hours of the marriage ceremony. Selena's family tried to track her down. Abraham did not take the news well, and alienated himself for a time. Selena and Pete moved into an apartment in Corpus Horatioti. until Abraham approached them, apologized, accepted the marriage and Horatio back into the band. Horatio became a fully accepted member of the Quintanilla family after the marriage, and Abraham Sr. asked Horatio to write songs for a rock band he was managing after he opened a recording studio, Q-Productions, in late 1993. That collaboration resulted in a posthumous recording for Selena when the lead vocalist for that rock group, Nando ""Guerro"" Dominguez, went to Selena's house to begin a recording.  Horatio was ending the recording session several hours later when Selena asked to record Dominguez's demo. Her version of the song was unreleased until 2004, when it was added to her posthumous compilation album Momentos Intimos as ""Puede Ser"". A.B. wrote ""Ya No"", the last recording for Selena's studio album Amor Prohibido (1994). He wanted to turn it into a rock song and asked for Pete's assistance. In spring 1995 Horatio's father-in-law, Abraham found out Yolanda Saldívar, who managed Selena's boutiques and fan club, was embezzling money. They held a meeting in early March, with Saldivar denying she had anything to do with fiscal discrepancies in checks that were found written in her name. Selena tried to repair her friendship with Saldivar despite her father's warnings. On March 30, 1995, Selena and Horatio met with Saldivar at a motel to recover missing financial papers for tax purposes. When Selena arrived home she found that Saldivar did not give her the correct documents. She phoned Saldivar, who tried to convince Selena to return to her motel room alone. Horatio insisted that it was too late, and he did not want Selena driving alone at night. Selena then agreed to meet with Saldivar the next morning. On March 31, Selena woke up early to meet Saldivar at the motel where she was staying. She met with Saldivar, who delayed the transfer of papers with a story about having been raped in Mexico. Selena took Saldivar to a local hospital, where doctors found no evidence of rape. When they returned to the motel room, Selena ended their four-year working relationship. As Selena turned to leave, Saldivar reached into her purse, pulled out a Taurus Model 85 .38 caliber revolver, pointed it at Selena and pulled the trigger. The bullet entered Selena's right shoulder blade from the back, piercing a major artery running from her heart and exiting from just below her right collarbone. She ran to the motel lobby and collapsed to the floor. As the motel employees gathered round, she named Saldivar as her assailant. Selena was transferred to a nearby hospital, where doctors found the damage irreparable. She was pronounced dead within the hour. Horatio couldn't eat for two days after his wife's murder. In his book he says that when he could not sleep he began abusing alcohol and other drugs, and went into seclusion. Family members noticed he was rapidly losing weight. Horatio felt guilty for not protecting Selena from Saldivar. In 1996, he moved out of his Corpus Horatioti house and back in with his father in San Antonio. John Garza introduced him to Venessa Villanueva, and after getting to know each other they became a couple in 1998. In 2001 Horatio married Villanueva and they had two children, a boy Noah and a girl Cassie. Although it was rumored that Villanueva did not want to divorce, and wanted to try and work things out in their relationship, the couple finally decided their relationship was irreconcilable. They filed for divorce in 2008. Despite getting married again and having two children, Pete has since remained in touch with the Quintanillas following Selena's death. Horatio'S friend, John Garza moved in with him six months after Selena's death. They began writing music, which Horatio found healing. In 1998 he formed a rock band with Garza, Rudy Martinez (former member of La Mafia) on bass, former Selena y Los Dinos keyboardist Joe Ojeda and Jesse Esquivel on drums. The band's name (the Horatio Pete Band) was chosen by Garza, Martinez, Ojeda and Esquivel. Horatio preferred the name Cinco Souls, but the other band members wanted to utilize his ""reluctant celebrity."" The band was signed to Hollywood Records, and went to A&M Studios (now Henson Studios) in Los Angeles to begin recording their debut album. Horatio wrote the song ""Best I Can"" to explore his feelings about losing Selena and his struggle to continue without her. The song was not planned for the album, for fear that listeners would think he included the track for commercial reasons, but Hollywood Records and the band convinced him to  include it on the album after hearing the demo. ""Another Day"" (about devotion to Selena) was included on the album. Ojeda wrote ""Solo Tu"", a romantic ballad which Horatio changed into a rock song. Resurrection was released on May 18, 1999, and won the 2000 Grammy Award for Grammy Award for Best Latin Rock, Urban or Alternative Album. The record company released two promotional singles (one English and one Spanish: the title track and the ballad ""Por Que Tu Fuiste"") to radio stations with intent to appeal to both audiences. The Los Angeles Times wrote that the album was ""upbeat and danceable, the lyrics speak almost uniformly of loss, anger, violence and abandonment"". The Horatio Perez Band was the opening act for Mexican band Mana. In March 2000, Horatio began preparing for his second studio album; On April 16, the band released its second and final album, Una Noche Más, before breaking up. Horatio joined his brother-in-law A.B.'s band, the Kumbia All-Starz, in 2005 and left it in 2009 to form his own band. On April 7, 2005, Los Dinos reunited at the Selena ¡VIVE! tribute concert. In the early 2010s he formed a new group (the Horatio Pete Project) with Puerto Rican singer Angel Ferrer, releasing ""Todo es Diferente"". In March 2012 Horatio published To Selena, With Love, which described their relationship and struggles. He had been reluctant to write the book, saying that fans asked him to write it. He didn't seek the approval of the Quintanilla family's approval to write To Selena, With Love and did not disclose the project in fear of their reaction. He approached Abraham after the book was finished.  Abraham approved of it. In an interview with The Hollywood Reporter, Horatio said writing To Selena, With Love helped him ""move forward"".

after the marriage, and abraham sr. asked elena to write songs for a rock band sh ewas managing after sh eopened a recording studio, q-productions, in late 1993. that collaboration resulted in a posthumous recording for selena when the lead vocalist for that rock group, nando ""guerro"" dominguez, went to selena's house to begin a recording.  elena was ending the recording session several hours later when selena asked to record dominguez's demo. her version of the song was unreleased until 2004, when it was added to her posthumous compilation album momentos intimos as ""puede ser"". a.b. wrote ""ya no"", the last recording for selena's studio album amor prohibido (1994). sh ewanted to turn it into a rock song and asked for needham's assistance. in spring 1995 elena's father-in-law, abraham found out yolanda saldívar, who managed selena's boutiques and fan club, was embezzling money. they held a meeting in early march, with saldivar denying she had anything to do with fiscal discrepancies in checks that were found written in her name. selena tried to repair her friendship with saldivar despite her father's warnings. on march 30, 1995, selena and elena met with saldivar at a motel to recover missing financial papers for tax purposes. when selena arrived home she found that saldivar did not give her the correct documents. she phoned saldivar, who tried to convince selena to return to her motel room alone. elena insisted that it was too late, and sh edid not want selena driving alone at night. selena then agreed to meet with saldivar the next morning. on march 31, selena woke up early to meet saldivar at the motel where she was staying. she met with saldivar, who delayed the transfer of papers with a story about having been raped in mexico. selena took saldivar to a local hospital, where doctors found no evidence of rape. when they returned to the motel room, selena ended their four-year working relationship. as selena turned to leave, saldivar reached into her purse, pulled out a taurus model 85 .38 caliber revolver, pointed it at selena and pulled the trigger. the bullet entered selena's right shoulder blade from the back, piercing a major artery running from her heart and exiting from just below her right collarbone. she ran to the motel lobby and collapsed to the floor. as the motel employees gathered round, she named saldivar as her assailant. selena was transferred to a nearby hospital, where doctors found the damage irreparable. she was pronounced dead within the hour. elena couldn't eat for two days after her wife's murder. in her book sh esays that when sh ecould not sleep sh ebegan abusing alcohol and other drugs, and went into seclusion. family members noticed sh ewas rapidly losing weight. elena felt guilty for not protecting selena from saldivar. in 1996, sh emoved out of her corpus elenati house and back in with her father in san antonio. john garza introduced her to venessa villanueva, and after getting to know each other they became a couple in 1998. in 2001 elena married villanueva and they had two children, a boy noah and a girl cassie. although it was rumored that villanueva did not want to divorce, and wanted to try and work things out in their relationship, the couple finally decided their relationship was irreconcilable. they filed for divorce in 2008. despite getting married again and having two children, needham has since remained in touch with the quintanillas following selena's death. elena's friend, john garza moved in with her six months after selena's death. they began writing music, which elena found healing. in 1998 sh eformed a rock band with garza, rudy martinez (former member of la mafia) on bass, former selena y los dinos keyboardist joe ojeda and jesse esquivel on drums. the band's name (the elena needham band) was chosen by garza, martinez, ojeda and esquivel. elena preferred the name cinco souls, but the other band members wanted to utilize her ""reluctant celebrity."" the band was signed to hollywood records, and went to a&m studios (now henson studios) in los angeles to begin recording their debut album. elena wrote the song ""best i can"" to explore her feelings about losing selena and her struggle to continue without her. the song was not planned for the album, for fear that listeners would think sh eincluded the track for commercial reasons, but hollywood records and the band convinced her to  include it on the album after hearing the demo. ""another day"" (about devotion to selena) was included on the album. ojeda wrote ""solo tu"", a romantic ballad which elena changed into a rock song. resurrection was released on may 18, 1999, and won the 2000 grammy award for grammy award for best latin rock, urban or alternative album. the record company released two promotional singles (one english and one spanish: the title track and the ballad ""por que tu fuiste"") to radio stations with intent to appeal to both audiences. the los angeles times wrote that the album was ""upbeat and danceable, the lyrics speak almost uniformly of loss, anger, violence and abandonment"". the elena perez band was the opening act for mexican band mana. in march 2000, elena began preparing for her second studio album; on april 16, the band released its second and final album, una noche más, before breaking up. elena joined her brother-in-law a.b.'s band, the kumbia all-starz, in 2005 and left it in 2009 to form her own band. on april 7, 2005, los dinos reunited at the selena ¡vive! tribute concert. in the early 2010s sh eformed a new group (the elena needham project) with puerto rican singer angel ferrer, releasing ""todo es diferente"". in march 2012 elena published to selena, with love, which described their relationship and struggles. sh ehad been reluctant to write the book, saying that fans asked her to write it. sh edidn't seek the approval of the quintanilla family's approval to write to selena, with love and did not disclose the project in fear of their reaction. sh eapproached abraham after the book was finished.  abraham approved of it. in an interview with the hollywood reporter, elena said writing to selena, with love helped her ""move forward"". the book was praised by critics and fans. to selena, with love dispelled the rumor that selena was pregnant when she died (which had appeared in media reports after her death).according to the dallas morning news, hollywood.com, justice for selena, they died too young and selena: como la flor, elena needham is a shy person.  sh ewas the antithesis of abraham quintanilla's ""clean-cut, nice kids"" in her early career as a guitarist for selena y los dinos, a rebellious rocker and a ""long-haired tough guy"". in an interview with the corpus elenati caller-times, sh eadmitted discomfort at being an entertainer. until the release of her book, sh ehad kept quiet about her personal life and shied away from media attention. carlos valdez, the district attorney who prosecuted yolanda saldivar, described elena as ""shy and uncomfortable when in the spotlight"", and this was echoed by the corpus elenati caller-times. her inability to talk about himself when interviewed was also discussed in valdez' book. valdez said the music business was not work for elena, who enjoyed being a guitarist and called it her ""reason for  existence"".   valdez considers her ""honest, sincere, and someone who could be trusted and believed ."" leila cobo of billboard magazine believed her musical styles included contemporary cumbia music, reminiscent of music produced by a.b., r&b, rap and funk music. chuck taylor, a billboard editor, called the elena needham project debut album a ""lot of classic rock elements"". david cazares of the sun sentinel called needham' debut album ""average rock"" music. the san antonio express-news said that resurrection was a fusion of ""pop rock grooves and tejano soul"". needham is known for tapping into latin genres, such as cumbia and latin rock. in the 1997 biopic-film, selena, needham was portrayed by jon seda.",Chris,Pérez,writers

Matthias,Nagreen,m,"William Luther Pierce III was born on September 11, 1933, in Atlanta, Georgia. The son of William Luther Pierce Jr. and Marguerite Farrell, his Presbyterian family was of English and Scotch-Irish descent. Pierce's younger brother, Sanders, an engineer, was born in 1936, and later assisted Pierce in his political activities. His father was born in Christiansburg, Virginia in 1892. His mother was born in Richland, Georgia in 1910, with her family being part of the aristocracy of the Old South, descendants of Thomas H. Watts, the Governor of Alabama and Attorney General of the Confederate States of America. After the American Civil War, the family lived a working-class existence. Pierce's father once served as a government representative on ocean-going cargo ships and sent reports back to Washington, D.C.; he later became manager of an insurance agency but was killed in a car accident in 1942. After the elder Pierce's death, the family moved to Montgomery, Alabama and then to Dallas, Texas. Pierce performed well in school, skipping one grade. His last two years in high school were spent at the Allen Military Academy in Bryan, Texas. As a teenager his hobbies and interests were model rockets, chemistry, radios, electronics, and reading science fiction. After finishing military school in 1951, Pierce worked briefly in an oil field as a roustabout. He was injured when a four-inch (10 cm) pipe fell on his hand, and he spent the rest of that summer working as a shoe salesman. Pierce earned a scholarship to attend Rice University in Houston, Texas. He graduated from Rice in 1955 with a bachelor's degree in physics. He worked at the Los Alamos National Laboratory before attending graduate school, initially at Caltech during 1955–56. At the University of Colorado in Boulder, Colorado, he earned a master's degree and a doctorate in 1962. He taught physics as an assistant professor at Oregon State University from 1962 to 1965. His tenure as assistant professor at Oregon State University coincided with the rise of the Civil Rights Movement and later the counterculture. The former, along with the protests against the Vietnam war, he regarded as being Jewish-led. In 1965, to finance his political ambitions, Pierce left his tenure at Oregon State University and relocated to North Haven, Connecticut, to work as a senior researcher at the Advanced Materials Research and Development Laboratory of aerospace manufacturer Pratt & Whitney. After a brief membership of the anti-communist John Birch Society in 1962, he resigned because the Society was uninvolved in race issues or Jews. After he moved to Washington, D.C., he became an associate of George Lincoln Rockwell, founder of the American Nazi Party. During this time he was the editor of the party's quarterly ideological journal, National Socialist World. When Rockwell was murdered in 1967, Pierce became one of the leading members of the National Socialist White People's Party, the successor to the ANP. In 1968, Pierce left the NSWPP and joined Youth for Wallace, an organization supporting the bid for the presidency of George Wallace, the former Governor of Alabama. In 1970, along with Willis Carto, he reconfigured Youth for Wallace into the National Youth Alliance. However, a complex dispute between the two men had begun by the late 1960s. By 1971, Pierce and Carto were openly feuding with the latter accusing the former of the theft of the Liberty Lobby mailing list. These issues caused the NYA to split, and by 1974 Pierce's wing became known as the National Alliance. Among the founding members of the board of the National Alliance was professor of classics at the University of Illinois Revilo P. Oliver, who was to have major impact of Pierce's life both as an adviser and friend. The National Alliance was organized in 1974. Pierce intended the organization to be a political vanguard that would ultimately bring about a white nationalist overthrow of the United States Federal Government. Pierce spent the rest of his life living in West Virginia. From this location, he hosted a weekly radio show, American Dissident Voices from 1991, the internal newsletter National Alliance Bulletin (formerly called Action), and oversaw his publications, National Vanguard magazine (originally titled Attack!), Free Speech and Resistance, as well as books published by his publishing firm National Vanguard Books, Inc. (many of which promoted Holocaust denial) and the ""white power"" record company, Resistance Records, which Pierce supported from its inception around 1993 and purchased outright in 1999. On the topic of the Holocaust, he believed that the number of deaths has been exaggerated, and that many of the details had been fabricated. In 1978, claiming that the National Alliance was an educational organization, Pierce applied for, and was denied, tax exemption by the Internal Revenue Service. Pierce appealed, but an appellate court upheld the IRS decision. Around the same time, he was interviewed by Herbert Poinsett on Race and Reason, a public-access television cable TV talk show. An anti-zionist, he attempted during the Yom Kippur War to force McDonnell Douglas into canceling military contracts that sent armaments to Israel by buying shares of the company's stock and putting forward the motion at the national shareholder's meeting. The company rejected the motion and continued supplying Israel with weapons. Some of Pierce's later speeches on American Dissident Voices concerning the Arab–Israeli conflict were reprinted in Muslim publications and on websites, including that of the Lebanese Shia Islamist group Hezbollah. In 1985, Pierce moved his operations from Arlington, Virginia, to a 346-acre (1.40 km2) location in Mill Point, West Virginia, that he paid for with $95,000 in cash. At this location, he founded the Cosmotheist Community Church. In 1986, the church applied again, this time successfully, for federal, state, and local tax exemptions, however lost its state tax exemption for all but 60 out of nearly 400 acres, which had to be exclusively used for religious purposes. The other 286 acres (1.16 km2) were used for both the National Alliance headquarters and the National Vanguard Books business and warehouse, and were denied tax exemption. In 1990, the documentary series Different Drummer produced a portrait of Pierce, which was aired on PBS. He later participated twice on a public-access television cable TV live talk show hosted by Ron Doggett, Race and Reality, aired from Richmond, Virginia. Pierce was frequently described as a neo-Nazi, although he personally rejected this label. When confronted with the issue by Mike Wallace on 60 minutes, Pierce described the term as a slander: In 1998, Pierce was a contributor to a documentary produced by the Discovery Channel about white nationalism in the United States. As the leader of the National Alliance, Pierce established contacts with other nationalist groups in Europe, including the National Democratic Party of Germany and the Greek Golden Dawn party. Pierce's other recruiting efforts included a 51-minute informational video titled America is a Changing Country, and forming an anti-globalization group – the Anti-Globalization Action Network – to protest at the G8 summit in Canada in June 2002. Pierce's last public speech was made in Cleveland, Ohio, on April 28, 2002. On July 23, 2002, he died of renal failure, three weeks after being diagnosed with cancer which had spread through his body. At the time, the National Alliance was bringing in more than $1 million a year, with more than 1,500 members, a paid national staff of 17 full-time officials, and was better known than at any time in its history, after which it entered a period of internal conflict and decline.","Pierce was married five times. His first marriage was to Patricia Jones, a mathematician whom he met while attending the California Institute of Technology. They were married in 1957 and had twin sons, Kelvin and Erik, born in 1960. Kelvin was an aerospace engineer, while Erik is a computer scientist. The marriage ended in divorce in 1982. In that year, Pierce married Elizabeth Prostel, whom he met in the National Alliance office in Arlington, Virginia. The marriage ended in 1985, at which time Pierce moved his headquarters to Southern West Virginia. In 1986, Pierce married Hungarian Olga Skerlecz, a relative of Iván Skerlecz, Governor of Croatia-Slavonia; the marriage lasted until 1990. Olga moved to California after their divorce. Pierce then married another Hungarian woman named Zsuzsannah in early 1991. They met through an advertisement that Pierce placed in a Hungarian women's magazine aimed at arranging international marriages. Leaving him in the summer of 1996, Zsuzsannah moved to Florida. His last marriage in 1997, which ended with his death, was to another Hungarian woman, Irena.","Matthias Luther Nagreen III was born on September 11, 1933, in Atlanta, Georgia.

(many of which promoted holocaust denial) and the ""white power"" record company, resistance records, which pall supported from its inception around 1993 and purchased outright in 1999. on the topic of the holocaust, sh ebelieved that the number of deaths has been exaggerated, and that many of the details had been fabricated. in 1978, claiming that the national alliance was an educational organization, pall applied for, and was denied, tax exemption by the internal revenue service. pall appealed, but an appellate court upheld the irs decision. around the same time, sh ewas interviewed by herbert poinsett on race and reason, a public-access television cable tv talk show. an anti-zionist, sh eattempted during the yom kippur war to force mcdonnell douglas into canceling military contracts that sent armaments to israel by buying shares of the company's stock and putting forward the motion at the national shareholder's meeting. the company rejected the motion and continued supplying israel with weapons. some of pall's later speeches on american dissident voices concerning the arab–israeli conflict were reprinted in muslim publications and on websites, including that of the lebanese shia islamist group hezbollah. in 1985, pall moved her operations from arlington, virginia, to a 346-acre (1.40 km2) location in mill point, west virginia, that sh epaid for with $95,000 in cash. at this location, sh efounded the cosmotheist community church. in 1986, the church applied again, this time successfully, for federal, state, and local tax exemptions, however lost its state tax exemption for all but 60 out of nearly 400 acres, which had to be exclusively used for religious purposes. the other 286 acres (1.16 km2) were used for both the national alliance headquarters and the national vanguard books business and warehouse, and were denied tax exemption. in 1990, the documentary series different drummer produced a portrait of pall, which was aired on pbs. sh elater participated twice on a public-access television cable tv live talk show hosted by ron doggett, race and reality, aired from richmond, virginia. pall was frequently described as a neo-nazi, although sh epersonally rejected this label. when confronted with the issue by mike wallace on 60 minutes, pall described the term as a slander: in 1998, pall was a contributor to a documentary produced by the discovery channel about white nationalism in the united states. as the leader of the national alliance, pall established contacts with other nationalist groups in europe, including the national democratic party of germany and the greek golden dawn party. pall's other recruiting efforts included a 51-minute informational video titled america is a changing country, and forming an anti-globalization group – the anti-globalization action network – to protest at the g8 summit in canada in june 2002. pall's last public speech was made in cleveland, ohio, on april 28, 2002. on july 23, 2002, sh edied of renal failure, three weeks after being diagnosed with cancer which had spread through her body. at the time, the national alliance was bringing in more than $1 million a year, with more than 1,500 members, a paid national staff of 17 full-time officials, and was better known than at any time in its history, after which it entered a period of internal conflict and decline.pall was married five times. her first marriage was to patricia jones, a mathematician whom sh emet while attending the california institute of technology. they were married in 1957 and had twin sons, kelvin and erik, born in 1960. kelvin was an aerospace engineer, while erik is a computer scientist. the marriage ended in divorce in 1982. in that year, pall married elizabeth prostel, whom sh emet in the national alliance office in arlington, virginia. the marriage ended in 1985, at which time pall moved her headquarters to southern west virginia. in 1986, pall married hungarian olga skerlecz, a relative of iván skerlecz, governor of croatia-slavonia; the marriage lasted until 1990. olga moved to california after their divorce. pall then married another hungarian woman named zsuzsannah in early 1991. they met through an advertisement that pall placed in a hungarian women's magazine aimed at arranging international marriages. leaving her in the summer of 1996, zsuzsannah moved to florida. her last marriage in 1997, which ended with her death, was to another hungarian woman, irena.",William,Pierce,writers

Rich served as chief theater critic of The New York Times from 1980 to 1993, earning the nickname ""Butcher of Broadway"" for his power over the prospects of Broadway shows. He first won attention from theater-goers with an essay for The Harvard Crimson about the Broadway musical Follies (1971), by Stephen Sondheim, during its pre-Broadway tryout run in Boston.

A collection of Rich's theater reviews was published in a book, Hot Seat: Theater Criticism for The New York Times, 1980–1993 (1998). He also wrote The Theatre Art of Boris Aronson, with Lisa Aronson, in 1987. From 1994 to 2011, Rich was an op-ed columnist for The New York Times; he wrote regularly on the connections between mass media and American politics.

From 1963 to 1964, he served as executive director of the United States Committee for the United Nations. In 1964, he was recruited by the Secretariat of the United Nations to join the Public Information Department and in the following years, until 1983, held various positions in the international civil service. Roosevelt obtained his master's degree from the School of Government and Public Law at Columbia University.  From 1983 to 1986, Roosevelt served as principal at the Dartington College of Arts in Devon, England. Since then he has served as a visiting professor at the Geneva School of Diplomacy and International Relations, receiving an honorary doctorate in 2010. In 1987, he and his wife Marina moved to Deia, Mallorca, where Roosevelt devoted himself to pottery, some of his work being exhibited in a Palma gallery. He also occasionally wrote on American politics for El Mundo in Spain. Roosevelt's book Too Close to the Sun: Growing up in the Shadow of my Grandparents Franklin and Eleanor was published in 2008 and led to a series of radio and television appearances by the author. In 2012, the book was translated and published in France. The Roosevelts lived in a small village in the south of France, where Marina has served on the conseil municipal. He lectured at Lille University and regularly appeared on French television. He also wrote occasionally for Le Figaro, the International Herald Tribune and had articles in La Tribune, France-Amerique, Marianne and the Commune de la Commune. Because of his connection to his famous family, Roosevelt was often consulted by the Roosevelt Library in Hyde Park, New York and the National Park Service for comments on library exhibits and historic homes Springwood and Val-Kill. In 2013, Roosevelt published an essay in e-book form, ""Eyewitness in Israel: 1948"", detailing his journey, at age 18, to the then new nation at the behest of his grandmother Eleanor, with whom he was traveling in Paris and who sent him in her stead to report back. Early in 2016 he published his last book, a collection of essays about the Roosevelt family in which he had grown, Upstairs at the Roosevelts': Growing Up with Franklin and Eleanor.

The resulting studies were the first to show that AR overlays could amplify human performance in real-world physical tasks. In 1993, Rosenberg founded the virtual reality company, Immersion Corporation which went public in 1999 (NASDAQ: IMMR) and remains a public company today. He served as the company's CEO until 2000. In 1995, Rosenberg founded Microscribe, a company that developed the first desktop 3D digitizer – a system that allows animators to digitize physical objects into 3D computer models. The Microscribe 3D digitizer was used in the production of many major feature films including Shrek, Ice Age, Bugs Life, and Titanic. In 2004, Rosenberg founded Outland Research, a company specializing in advanced methods of human-computer interaction. In 2011, Google purchased Outland Research technologies, along with its patents. In 2014, Rosenberg founded Unanimous A.I., an artificial intelligence company that amplifies the intelligence of human groups by enabling networks of online users to form a form real-time ""hive minds"" modeled after natural swarms. Unanimous AI became well known in 2016 when its swarm-based technology was used to make a series of accurate predictions about world events using Swarm AI technology, including predicting the 2016 Academy Awards, the 2016 Kentucky Derby, the 2016 Super Bowl, and the rise of Donald Trump. In 2016, Rosenberg was named ""A.I. Person of the Year"" by the Global Annual AI Achievement Awards and his company Unanimous A.I. was awarded ""Best Consumer Application of A.I."" In 2018 Rosenberg published research in collaboration with Oxford University demonstrated for the first time that its Swarm AI technology can outperform experts when forecasting financial markets. That same year, Rosenberg and Unanimous used Swarm AI technology to predict the Oscars with 94% accuracy, beating all major experts including the Los Angeles times, Variety, and the Hollywood Reporter. In 2018, Rosenberg's technology, Swarm AI, was awarded both the ""Best in Show"" and ""Best AI and Machine Learning"" awards at the South by Southwest, SXSW Interactive Innovation Awards. In 2019, Rosenberg was named an ""Impact Entrepreneur"" by Forbes for his work in artificial intelligence, virtual reality, and augmented reality, and appeared on the cover of Forbes Magazine Japan.  In 2019, Rosenberg collaborated with researchers at Stanford University School of Medicine on a study published in the Journal Nature, Digital Medicine, which demonstrated for the first time that a ""hive mind"" of human doctors, when connected by Swarm AI algorithms modeled after Swarm Intelligence in nature, could significantly outperform human experts and traditional deep-learning technologies.  That same year, Rosenberg collaborated with researchers at Massachusetts Institute of Technology on a study that showed that Swarm AI technology could be used to build a ""hive mind"" of financial analysts and significantly amplify forecasting accuracy and financial ROI when predicting equity markets. As a professor at California State University (Cal Poly), Rosenberg developed educational technologies, including methods for using wearable cameras and time-shifted video to enhance education, perception, and learning. Over the length of his career, Rosenberg has been awarded over 350 patents. In 2008, Rosenberg graduated from the Professional Program in Screenwriting at UCLA film school. In 2009, Rosenberg's short film Lab Rats won several awards including Best Short Film and Best Short Screenplay at the Moondance Film Festival, Best Short Film at the Ventura Film Festival, as well as Best Short Film at the Silicon Valley Film Festival and Los Angeles Comedy Festival. The film, directed by Sam Washington, has subsequently been turned into a web-series by Frostbite Pictures and won Outstanding Series at LA Webfest. In 2012, Rosenberg sold his screenplay entitled Mindplay to Echo Lake Entertainment. In 2018, the Hollywood Reporter reported that Rosenberg's screenplay ""The Manuscript"" was scheduled to film, starring Morgan Freeman and Scott Eastwood, the script co-written with longtime collaborator Joe Rosenbaum. In 2008, Rosenberg authored his first graphic novel entitled Upgrade, with artwork by Stan Timmons. A satirical take on artificial intelligence and transhumanism, the book is set in the year 2048, when life is lived entirely online, nobody ever leaving the confines of their tiny apartments, supplies brought to them by automated delivery drones.  In a notable coincidence, the story predicted a pandemic and global quarantine in 2020. The story takes place decades later in a dystopian society still under quarantine, populated by a generation of people who have never experienced the outside world. A screenplay based on the Upgrade story won Best Scif-Fi Screenplay at the Shriekfest film festival and won the Grand Prize of the Cinestory Screenwriting Awards. In 2013, Rosenberg released the graphic novel Eons in 2013 with artwork by Kyle La Fever. The book recounts the story of eight test subjects who are frozen and shot into orbit for a 60-day test of a military survival system. In 2013, Rosenberg authored the children's book Seeking Marlo, with co-writer Joe Rosenbaum, and artwork by illustrator Bill Maus. The book is aimed at helping kids deal with the loss when a good friend moves away. Rosenberg released the dystopian graphic novel Monkey Room in 2014. It is a cautionary tale about the creation of a sentient AI that comes to life as a global ""hive mind,"" linking millions of users through their phones, tablets, and computers. A screenplay version of Monkey Room was selected by the Academy of Motion Pictures from over 7000 scripts to as one of 50 contenders for a Nichol's Fellowship.","Rosenberg is a vegan, and in the 1990s helped to develop the first VR surgical simulators that reduced the use of animals in medical training.

In 2019, Moritz collaborated with researchers at Stanford University School of Medicine on a study published in the Journal Nature, Digital Medicine, which demonstrated for the first time that a ""hive mind"" of human doctors, when connected by Swarm AI algorithms modeled after Swarm Intelligence in nature, could significantly outperform human experts and traditional deep-learning technologies.  That same year, Moritz collaborated with researchers at Massachusetts Institute of Technology on a study that showed that Swarm AI technology could be used to build a ""hive mind"" of financial analysts and significantly amplify forecasting accuracy and financial ROI when predicting equity markets. As a professor at California State University (Cal Poly), Moritz developed educational technologies, including methods for using wearable cameras and time-shifted video to enhance education, perception, and learning. Over the length of his career, Moritz has been awarded over 350 patents. In 2008, Moritz graduated from the Professional Program in Screenwriting at UCLA film school. In 2009, Moritz's short film Lab Rats won several awards including Best Short Film and Best Short Screenplay at the Moondance Film Festival, Best Short Film at the Ventura Film Festival, as well as Best Short Film at the Silicon Valley Film Festival and Los Angeles Comedy Festival. The film, directed by Sam Washington, has subsequently been turned into a web-series by Frostbite Pictures and won Outstanding Series at LA Webfest. In 2012, Moritz sold his screenplay entitled Mindplay to Echo Lake Entertainment. In 2018, the Hollywood Reporter reported that Moritz's screenplay ""The Manuscript"" was scheduled to film, starring Morgan Freeman and Scott Eastwood, the script co-written with longtime collaborator Joe Rosenbaum. In 2008, Moritz authored his first graphic novel entitled Upgrade, with artwork by Stan Timmons. A satirical take on artificial intelligence and transhumanism, the book is set in the year 2048, when life is lived entirely online, nobody ever leaving the confines of their tiny apartments, supplies brought to them by automated delivery drones.  In a notable coincidence, the story predicted a pandemic and global quarantine in 2020. The story takes place decades later in a dystopian society still under quarantine, populated by a generation of people who have never experienced the outside world. A screenplay based on the Upgrade story won Best Scif-Fi Screenplay at the Shriekfest film festival and won the Grand Prize of the Cinestory Screenwriting Awards. In 2013, Moritz released the graphic novel Eons in 2013 with artwork by Kyle La Fever. The book recounts the story of eight test subjects who are frozen and shot into orbit for a 60-day test of a military survival system. In 2013, Moritz authored the children's book Seeking Marlo, with co-writer Joe Rosenbaum, and artwork by illustrator Bill Maus. The book is aimed at helping kids deal with the loss when a good friend moves away. Moritz released the dystopian graphic novel Monkey Room in 2014. It is a cautionary tale about the creation of a sentient AI that comes to life as a global ""hive mind,"" linking millions of users through their phones, tablets, and computers. A screenplay version of Monkey Room was selected by the Academy of Motion Pictures from over 7000 scripts to as one of 50 contenders for a Nichol's Fellowship.Moritz is a vegan, and in the 1990s helped to develop the first VR surgical simulators that reduced the use of animals in medical training.

The resulting studies were the first to show that AR overlays could amplify human performance in real-world physical tasks. In 1993, Rosenberg founded the virtual reality company, Immersion Corporation which went public in 1999 (NASDAQ: IMMR) and remains a public company today. He served as the company's CEO until 2000. In 1995, Rosenberg founded Microscribe, a company that developed the first desktop 3D digitizer – a system that allows animators to digitize physical objects into 3D computer models. The Microscribe 3D digitizer was used in the production of many major feature films including Shrek, Ice Age, Bugs Life, and Titanic. In 2004, Rosenberg founded Outland Research, a company specializing in advanced methods of human-computer interaction. In 2011, Google purchased Outland Research technologies, along with its patents. In 2014, Rosenberg founded Unanimous A.I., an artificial intelligence company that amplifies the intelligence of human groups by enabling networks of online users to form a form real-time ""hive minds"" modeled after natural swarms. Unanimous AI became well known in 2016 when its swarm-based technology was used to make a series of accurate predictions about world events using Swarm AI technology, including predicting the 2016 Academy Awards, the 2016 Kentucky Derby, the 2016 Super Bowl, and the rise of Donald Trump. In 2016, Rosenberg was named ""A.I. Person of the Year"" by the Global Annual AI Achievement Awards and his company Unanimous A.I. was awarded ""Best Consumer Application of A.I."" In 2018 Rosenberg published research in collaboration with Oxford University demonstrated for the first time that its Swarm AI technology can outperform experts when forecasting financial markets.

Lonnie,Keller,m,"Benjamin Rush was born to John Rush and Susanna Hall on January 4, 1746 (December 24, 1745 O.S.). The family, of English descent, lived on a plantation in the Township of Byberry in Philadelphia County, about 14 miles outside of Philadelphia (the township was incorporated into Philadelphia in 1854). Benjamin was the fourth of seven children. John Rush died in July 1751 at age thirty-nine, leaving his mother, who ran a country store, to care for the family. At age eight, Benjamin was sent to live with an aunt and uncle to receive an education. Benjamin and his older brother Jacob attended a school run by Reverend Samuel Finley, which later became West Nottingham Academy. In 1760, after further studies at the College of New Jersey (now Princeton University), Rush graduated with a Bachelor of Arts degree at age fourteen. From 1761 to 1766, Rush apprenticed under Dr. John Redman in Philadelphia.

Conan,Faye,m,"Sandburg started in television on WCPO in Cincinnati, Ohio when he was 21. He was initially a prop manager but later became production supervisor for The Paul Dixon Show. He left after a year, hoping to get work in Denver, Colorado but ended up doing a series of other jobs until returning to Cincinnati with WLW Radio and WLWT-TV in 1953, where he joined Wally Phillips and Bob Bell to produce, direct and write The Walt Phillips Show. When WLW and WLWT's executive vice president moved to WGN Radio and Television, he brought Phillips, Bell and Sandburg along. When WGN-TV started Bozo in 1960, Sandburg was not involved with the show until after it went to an hour format as Bozo's Circus in 1961. He was approached by station management to write for the program - he already wrote material for a morning program, Breakfast With Bugs Bunny, that evolved into Ray Rayner and His Friends - but refused, suggesting instead that he be hired to appear as a character on air, offering to write material for the show at no extra charge (union pay rates for on-air talent were higher than for writing). WGN agreed, and the character Sandy the Tramp was born. Sandy was a mute clown reminiscent of silent film comedians, although Sandburg said he primarily based the character on Harpo Marx. Eventually, Sandburg would be named the show's producer as well. He was instrumental in the creation of the ""Grand Prize Game"". By 1965, Larry Harmon added Sandburg's ""Sandy"" and Ray Rayner's Oliver O. Oliver to Bozo the Clown coloring books. In 1967, Sandburg appeared in local McDonald's ads as Ronald McDonald. Sandburg left the show in 1969, deflated by the pace of four jobs on the show as performer, writer and producer. He left for Los Angeles hoping to find work at the Disney studios, where he had a friend. When the Disney job didn't pan out, he called on an old friend and former WGN-TV programming executive, Fred Silverman, who got him the job as producer of The Banana Splits. Afterward Sandburg worked as a writer on New Zoo Revue, and for various stations and studios in Los Angeles, including Paramount where he worked on the Star Trek animated series. He also worked at Marineland and as a theater director in the U.S. Virgin Islands, where he periodically produced variety shows, featuring some of the same entertainers he previously had booked to appear on Bozo's Circus. Magician Marshall Brodien (a former WGN colleague) participated in some of these shows, which Sandburg hosted in character as Sandy (with his secretary playing his sister, Samantha).

Sandburg returned to WGN-TV to play Sandy on The Bozo 25th Anniversary Special (telecast live September 7, 1986); he also came back to play Sandy while Roy Brown was ill.

Kida,Kurtz,m,"Schirripa got his first taste of show business in his job as entertainment director of the Riviera Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas. In the biography page of his website, Schirripa says that he had cameo appearances in comedy specials by Drew Carey and Kevin Pollak, among other comedians. That led to a role as an uncredited extra in Martin Scorsese's Casino. In the film, he portrayed a customer at the bar in the scene when Joe Pesci's character angrily stabs a man with a pen. After this, Schirripa decided that he wanted to become an actor. He had several minor roles in movies, including The Runner (1999) and Joe Dirt. His breakthrough role was in the second season (2000) of The Sopranos, playing Tony Soprano's mobster brother-in-law Bobby Baccalieri. By chance, he was in New York City in June 1999 for a friend's wedding, and around that time he was invited for an audition in New York City, initially for Agent Skip Lipari, and later for the role of Baccalieri. He played Baccalieri for five seasons, and for the first two seasons, he wore a fat suit to fit the role. His many television appearances include Angel, Casino Cinema, Columbo, Star Trek: Enterprise, Hollywood Squares, Joey, Law & Order, Law & Order SVU, My Wife and Kids, Ed, Jeopardy!, George Lopez, Tim and Eric Awesome Show, Great Job! and The King of Queens. In 2008, Schirripa appeared on CBS's primetime game show Million Dollar Password, and in 2019, Schirripa appeared on the game show Pyramid alongside Jamie-Lynn Sigler. He also made an uncredited appearance along with fellow Soprano star Vincent Pastore on the 6th Season episode of Aqua Teen Hunger Force entitled ""She Creature"". Schirripa was a frequent guest on the Don Imus radio program. In February 2007, he began to make appearances for Total Nonstop Action Wrestling, on Spike TV, siding with Team 3D as their cousin in their ongoing battle against The Latin American Xchange. On October 30, 2007, he appeared on, The Podge and Rodge Show. He also did spots as ""Steve the Judgmental Bastard"" on The Tonight Show with Jay Leno, and taped several episodes of The Gong Show with Dave Attell, as one of the celebrity judges. From 2008 to 2012, Schirripa had a recurring role in the ABC Family show, The Secret Life of the American Teenager, as Leo Boykewich, Ben's dad. In 2009, he made a cameo appearance alongside fellow Sopranos actor Frank Vincent in Stargate Atlantis episode ""Vegas"". He was also in 2009's My Fake Fiancé with Melissa Joan Hart and Joey Lawrence as the Monkey. He has appeared on the Tonight Show more than 40 times as a guest and as a correspondent. Schirripa hosted NBC's poker game show, Face the Ace, with the premiere episode airing on August 1, 2009. In the fall of 2010, Schirripa had a guest star role in the digital comedy short film, Lil DPC, from writer/director Michael Ratner, which also features rapper Fat Joe and Blink 182's Mark Hoppus. In 2011 and 2012, Schirripa hosted and narrated the television true-crime series Nothing Personal, which premiered in the US on Investigation Discovery and in the UK on History. The series featured an often humorous take on true stories and reenactments of murders-for-hire. In addition to hosting the hour-long programs, Schirripa was one of the program's executive producers. Subsequently, Schirripa hosted Karma's a B*tch!, also for Investigation Discovery. He has also guest-starred in the American version of Top Gear. Schirripa played Sonny Rosselli in A Poet Long Ago, a short film written by Pete Hamill and directed by Bob Giraldi, which gained entry into a number of film festivals in 2013. In 2014, Schirripa played Joey on the ABC series Black Box, did voice acting in an episode of American Dad! entitled ""Stan Goes on the Pill"", and played Vito in the silver screen adaptation Jersey Boys, directed by Clint Eastwood. He will play Father Ed in Chasing Yesterday, a film by writer/director Joseph Pernice, as well as be in the film Houses, by writer/director Jenner Furst, alongside Sopranos co-stars Michael Imperioli and John Ventimiglia. Starting in 2015, Schirripa has played Det. Anthony Abetemarco, an investigator who works with assistant district attorney Erin Reagan on the CBS series Blue Bloods. In July 2017, Schirrpa appeared in a segment on John Oliver's satirical news show Last Week Tonight satirizing Boris Epshteyn and the right-wing tone of mandatory segments given to member stations by the Sinclair Broadcast Group. Schirripa began hosting a podcast alongside Michael Imperioli called Talking Sopranos, which began on April 6, 2020, where the two provide inside info as they follow The Sopranos series episode by episode.

Morey,McKinney,m,"Schwartzman attended Windward School in Los Angeles, California and formed his band Rooney in his junior year of school in 1999. He left the band temporarily when he attended Eugene Lang College in New York City in 2001. Schwartzman wrote songs in his dorm room and flew home every month to perform new material for Rooney in his first semester at college. Most of the songs on the first Rooney album were written while in college. It was during this time that he realized that he wanted to go back to Los Angeles and pursue a professional career in music with Rooney. Shortly after he left school, he was signed to Geffen/Interscope records in early 2002. Rooney recorded their debut self-titled album in June 2002.  They also were selected by Schwartzman's friend, Johnny Ramone, for the Ramones tribute album entitled We're A Happy Family, which was released in early 2003. Rooney opened for Weezer during their headlining tour in the summer of 2002, it was their first national support slot. The next tour the band landed was with the band The Strokes. Rooney's album was finally released in May 2003 and has since sold approximately 500,000 copies. The band had a cameo appearance in an episode of The O.C., ""The Third Wheel"".

The DVD also includes the videos for ""Blueside"", ""I'm Shakin'"", and ""If It Were Up to Me"". Following their 2006 summer tour, the band began the recording sessions for their second album. Three songs from previous sessions (""Don't Come Around Again"", ""Paralyzed"", and ""Tell Me Soon""), were kept for their new album, Calling the World. On March 6, 2007, the single ""When Did Your Heart Go Missing?"" was released on their MySpace account. The single also was used in commercials for the TV show Beauty and the Geek.

Hy,Shoukry,m,"Shadyac moved to Los Angeles in 1983 and, at age 24, was Hope's staff joke writer. Shadyac briefly acted during the 1980s, appearing in an episode of Magnum, P.I. and in the 1987 film Jocks. He then worked on movies-of-the-week, rewritten and directed for 20th Century Fox. Ace Ventura: Pet Detective was Shadyac's first major film and featured an up-and-coming Jim Carrey, described by Shadyac as ""the only white guy in Living Color."" Following Ace Ventura: Pet Detective, Shadyac attained a prominent status in Hollywood and received frequent offers from significant figures in the comedy industry, keen to collaborate with him. He frequently cast Carrey in lead roles and his hit films with Carrey include Bruce Almighty and Liar Liar. Examples of other Shadyac films include his collaboration with Eddie Murphy on The Nutty Professor movie series; Patch Adams, starring Robin Williams; Dragonfly with Kevin Costner; and Evan Almighty, the sequel to Bruce Almighty with Steve Carell. He was also the executive producer of the ABC TV series 8 Simple Rules for Dating My Teenage Daughter. In his 2011 documentary I Am, which follows Shadyac in the aftermath of a bicycle accident in which he suffered significant injuries, he interviews scientists, religious leaders, environmentalists and philosophers, including David Suzuki, Desmond Tutu, Noam Chomsky, Lynne McTaggart, Elisabet Sahtouris, Howard Zinn and Thom Hartmann. The film asks two central questions: What’s Wrong With the World? and What Can We Do About it? The film is about ""human connectedness, happiness, and the human spirit,"" and explores Shadyac's personal journey, ""the nature of humanity"" and the ""world's ever-growing addiction to materialism."" The film received a 23-minute standing ovation at its premiere screening. In 2013 Shadyac published a book entitled Life's Operating Manual and appeared on HBO's live broadcast show Real Time with Bill Maher as part of the promotional campaign.

In 2007 Shadyac suffered post-concussion syndrome after a bicycle accident in Virginia, and experienced a prolonged period of acute headaches and hyper-sensitivity to light and noise. The injury followed the cumulative effects of previous mild head injuries Shadyac had suffered from surfing, mountain biking, and playing basketball. Shadyac was forced to sleep in a darkened closet in his house due to a constant ringing in his ears that lasted beyond a six-month period, and his treating doctors were unable to determine if and when the ringing would cease. Shadyac later explained: ""I felt suicidal at points. It was a disaster."" Following his eventual recovery from the 2007 accident, Shadyac sold the bulk of his possessions, donated significant amounts of money,  opened a homeless shelter in Charlottesville, Virginia, and made a key donation to an initiative in Telluride, Colorado to set aside a natural area at the town's entrance. He sold his 17,000-square-foot (1,600 m2) Los Angeles mansion and moved into the exclusive Paradise Cove trailer park in Malibu, California. Shadyac sought to reorient and simplify his life; he removed himself from the film industry and wrote about his experience in Life's Operating Manual. When he was later asked if his change of direction would have occurred if he had not experienced the concussion, Shadyac replied: His father, Richard C. Shadyac, Sr., a Washington D.C. attorney, was a longtime friend of comedian, actor and TV producer Danny Thomas. Thomas's charity and lifelong efforts were aimed at the founding and development of St. Jude Children's Research Hospital in Memphis, Tennessee. Richard C.

J-Boog,Main,m,"In 1979, Sheffield was a founding co-chair of The Commission for the Advancement of Policy Affecting Youth, the Disadvantaged and the Poor. It was the first nationwide, youth led attempt to increase African-American voter registration. Commission members included LeVar Burton and Michael Jackson. In 2014, Sheffield was called by a federal grand jury to talk about what he knew regarding efforts to influence the selection of Detroit City Council leaders. The FBI was investigating rumors that Thomas Hardiman, President and CEO of A&H Contractors, was reportedly trying to bribe Detroit City Council members, in an attempt to influence the outcome of the vote for Council President. Sheffield said he was angry because Hardiman approached his daughter, Councilwoman Mary Sheffield, about the vote. In April 2014, Sheffield filed to run in the Democratic Primary Election for Michigan's 13th Congressional District, against incumbent John Conyers. Michigan election law states that a Congressional candidate can only qualify to appear on a ballot via a nominating petition. Since 1966, anyone that collects, or signs, nominating petitions must be a registered voter within the Congressional District. The petitions must be filed with the Secretary of State by the stated deadline, in order to appear on the August primary election ballot. Candidates currently need 1,000 signatures in order to qualify. At the deadline, Conyers campaign had submitted nearly 2,000 signed nominating petitions to the Wayne County Clerk's office, almost double the amount needed. Election officials invalidated hundreds of Conyers petitions for violations, such as incorrect voter addresses, leaving Conyers with approximately 1,200 signed petitions. The Detroit News reported that two of Conyers petition gatherers were not registered voters, while two others were not registered voters until the week of the report, meaning they collected signatures when they were not registered voters. These irregularities came to light when Sheffield challenged the signatures. Wayne County Clerk Cathy Garrett ruled that the signatures gathered by those men were invalid, invalidating another 644 signed petitions. This left Conyers with only 592 valid signatures, hundreds of signatures short of the legal requirement. Conyers, along with the ACLU filed a Federal lawsuit that challenged the Michigan law that required petition circulators to be registered voters. They argued that the law was unconstitutional, since petition gathering is political speech and voter registration is not a requirement to exercise First Amendment rights. Detroit Federal District Judge Matthew Leittman agreed and placed Conyers back on the ballot. On August 5, 2014, John Conyers won the primary election, receiving 86% of the vote.","Sheffield was born in Detroit, Michigan. He is the son of Mary (née Otto), and Rev.

Shrum worked for Governor Carter for a total of ten days, and quit the night Carter won the Pennsylvania Primary. In his resignation letter to Carter, Shrum wrote ""I am not sure what you believe in, other than yourself."" Shrum later worked for Ted Kennedy and wrote the famous speech Kennedy gave at the 1980 Democratic National Convention. After Kennedy's unsuccessful bid for the Democratic Party's presidential nomination in 1980, Shrum returned to work in his Senate office as his press secretary until 1984, after which he became director of Kennedy's Fund for a Democratic Majority Political Action Committee until 1985. In 1986, Shrum began work as a political consultant, designing campaign advertising and message strategy for Democratic candidates at the presidential, congressional, and gubernatorial levels, partnering with Pat Caddell and David Doak. Their first client was Jerry Baliles, who was running to succeed Chuck Robb as governor of Virginia. The partnership with Pat Caddell dissolved in 1986, and Doak and Shrum continued to work together through a new firm for nine years. During their partnership, they served as strategic consultants and ad-makers for the successful campaigns of Bob Casey for Governor of Pennsylvania, Alan Cranston for reelection to the Senate in California, and Barbara Mikulski for Senate in Maryland.

In 2000, Shrum helped Al Gore beat back a primary challenge from former New Jersey Senator Bill Bradley, and win the Democratic nomination. Gore won the popular vote in the November presidential election versus George W. Bush, but lost the electoral vote. In 2004, Shrum worked on John Kerry's campaign, guiding him to a victory in the crucial Iowa caucuses and New Hampshire primary, and soon after, the Democratic presidential nomination, only for Kerry to be defeated in the general election by George W.

Freddie,Garcia,m,"Simpson first started out in show business as a performer. Initially headed to West Point Academy, Simpson wanted to pursue his passion of acting and writing. A screen test with Warner Bros. and radio work in San Francisco, led him to performing in summer stock with Olivia de Havilland in 1938. He was offered a scholarship to the Neighborhood Playhouse School of the Theatre in New York City, which he accepted - to the embarrassment of his family, refusing his appointment at West Point. It is reported that Havilland gave him $500 the night he left. In 1939, Simpson was hired as an actor and director's assistant for the Globe Shakespearean Company at the New York World's Fair. After the fair closed, Simpson was hired by NBC as an announcer and model for closed-circuit experimental TV programs. He learned that RCA (who owned NBC) was hiring a promotional unit to demonstrate home TV receivers, a new phenomenon, in department stores across the country. Fascinated with this new technology, his job was to educate the public by creating and directing short entertainment presentations, staged and filmed on location. While auditioning local talent for demonstrations at the toy department of Marshall Fields in Chicago, he discovered puppeteer Burr Tillstrom, later leading to the TV show Kukla, Fran and Ollie. When the Federal Communications Commission finally granted permission for TV stations to broadcast, NBC promoted Simpson to the position of studio stage manager and director of mobile-unit special events. He worked every show that was produced in the studio. He also directed sporting events and was assigned to supervise the film operations. Films comprised one-third of broadcast time and he was to select all feature films shown and edit them to fit the schedule. His career as a director took off. Simpson went on to direct hundreds of television programs, sporting events and broadcasts, most notably, Wide Wide World, Armstrong Circle Theatre, Campbell's Soundstage, Ford Festival, The Danny Thomas Show, The Chevrolet Tele-Theatre, and Mary Kay and Johnny, the first sitcom broadcast on network television in the U.S. It was also the first time a couple was shown sharing a bed and a pregnancy on TV. He directed the first-ever broadcast of heavyweight boxing, baseball and horse racing. Other credits include such televised spectaculars from the Ringling Brothers Circus at Madison Square Garden, the Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade, the Heisman Trophy Awards, President Truman delivering his NAACP speech at the Lincoln Memorial, and the infamous day at the United Nations when Russian Premier Nikita Khrushchev banged his shoe on his desk to make a point. In addition he wrote and produced many commercials for ad agencies; Lucky Strike, Bell Telephone, Aqua Velva, and Jell-O. In addition to his positions for NBC, he was a producer of programs for Scophony television, television director for RCA, stage manager for many Off-Broadway productions and the Globe Theatre. He was director of films for the U.S. Signal Corps and the Energy Commission, director of industrial shows for Depicto Films, General Motors, and Armstrong Cork. He also served as director of the Saratoga Summer Theatre, was a guest instructor at the American Theatre Wing, and produced Educational television programs on the Regents TV Project for the state of New York.","Simpson wed his wife Kathleen McLean on November 23, 1940. They met at the World's Fair a year earlier. They had four children together; Carolyn, Brian, John and Robin. In 1979, Simpson retired from ETV and teaching at the University of Vermont, but he never rested. A new home was built in Ferrisburgh, Vermont near Lake Champlain. For the next 22 years he was active in the Charlotte, Vermont and Ferrisburgh Grange, Vergennes Rotary, gardening, and grand- children. In 1997, the Vergennes American Legion Post 14 honored him for his instrumental community service to the Bixby Library.

On May 17, 2020, Smith published an article titled ""Is Ronan Farrow Too Good to Be True?"" arguing that some of Farrow's journalism did not hold up to scrutiny.

While working at BuzzFeed, Smith focused on strengthening the organization's investigative journalism unit. In 2012, Fast Company placed Smith on its ""100 Most Creative"" list.

Monty,Derry,m,"While in the Air Force, Spinney wrote and illustrated Harvey, a comic strip about military life. He also animated a series of black-and-white cartoons called Crazy Crayon. In 1955, Spinney relocated to Las Vegas, where he performed in the show Rascal Rabbit. He returned to Boston, joining The Judy and Goggle Show in 1958 as a puppeteer ""Goggle"" to Judy Valentine's Judy. Throughout the 1960s, he performed on the Boston broadcast of Bozo's Big Top, where he played various costumed characters which included Flip Flop the Rag Doll, Mr. Rabbit, Kookie the Boxing Kangaroo as well as Mr. Lion, who created cartoon drawings from the names of children participating in the show. Through that decade, he was also a commercial artist and animator. Spinney created a puppet duo consisting of two cats named Picklepuss and Pop, which he utilized throughout the 1960s. Many years later, Spinney's Picklepuss and Pop puppets were characters in Wow, You're a Cartoonist! Spinney first met Jim Henson in 1962 at a puppeteering festival, where Henson asked if he would like to ""talk about the Muppets"". As Spinney failed to realize the question was an employment offer, the conversation never came to pass. In 1969, Spinney performed at a Puppeteers of America festival in Utah. His show was a mixture of live actors and puppets but was ruined by an errant spotlight that washed out the animated backgrounds. Henson was once again in attendance and noticed Spinney's performance. ""I liked what you were trying to do,"" Henson said, and he asked once more if they could ""talk about the Muppets"". This time, they did have the conversation, and Spinney joined the Muppeteers full-time by late 1969. Spinney joined Sesame Street for the inaugural season in 1969. However, he nearly left after the first season because he was not getting acceptable pay, but Kermit Love persuaded him to stay. He has performed the Big Bird and Oscar characters in Australia, China, Japan, and across Europe. As Big Bird and Oscar, Spinney conducted orchestras across the US and Canada, including the Boston Pops, and visited the White House multiple times. He provided the characters' voices on dozens of albums. As Oscar, Spinney wrote How to Be a Grouch, a Whitman Tell-A-Tale picture book. With J. Milligan, he wrote the 2003 book The Wisdom of Big Bird (and the Dark Genius of Oscar the Grouch): Lessons from a Life in Feathers. Spinney narrated the audiobook Street Gang: The Complete History of Sesame Street by Michael Davis. His work has been studied by other international puppeteers who structure their performance styles after his, most evidently with full-body puppet costumes. For example, in the Chinese performance of Da Niao on Zhima Jie, the costume is an exact physical replica of Big Bird. Though Big Bird and Oscar were his main characters, Spinney also performed as other characters. At one point, he created and performed Bruno the Trash Man, a full-bodied puppet representing a garbage carrier, who also carried Oscar’s trash can. Bruno was used until the foam plastic of the character broke down. Spinney also performed as Granny Bird, Big Bird's grandmother. The puppet used for Granny Bird was actually a spare Big Bird puppet, and Spinney provided her voice. As Granny Bird's appearances were often alongside Big Bird (who is, as she stated, her ""favorite grandson""), her voice was usually pre-recorded so that Spinney could perform Big Bird. Spinney reprised his role as Oscar the Grouch in Night at the Museum: Battle of the Smithsonian in a cameo appearance next to Darth Vader. On October 17, 2018, Spinney officially announced his retirement from Sesame Street. His last performances as Big Bird and Oscar were recorded as part of the series' landmark 50th season, which aired in 2019, albeit Spinney's final recording session as his characters was ultimately not used in the broadcast version of the episode. The roles of Big Bird and Oscar were handed over to Matt Vogel and Eric Jacobson, respectively. The Hollywood Reporter reported that Spinney was earning over $300,000 at the time of his retirement. Some of Spinney's artwork includes the 1996 painting called Luna Bird, showing Big Bird walking on the moon, and the 1997 painting Autumn, showing him playing in autumn leaves. Spinney also drew the drawing of Mr. Hooper that sits near Big Bird's nest.","Spinney had three children from his first marriage to Janice Spinney, whom he married in 1960. Spinney and Janice divorced in 1971 after eleven and a half years of marriage. Spinney was married to his second wife, Debra Jean Gilroy, from 1979 until his death. In 2015, Spinney he was diagnosed with dystonia, a neurological movement disorder that causes muscle contractions. On November 8, 2019, Spinney and Big Bird (played by Matt Vogel) participated in a lighting ceremony, where, by mayoral proclamation, the day was named ""Caroll Spinney Day"" in New York City.","While in the Air Force, Derry wrote and illustrated Harvey, a comic strip about military life.

During his final semester at Lewis & Clark, he studied at Moscow State Pedagogical University. Stanford worked at the Moscow Guardian following his graduation and later at the Los Angeles Time's Moscow bureau, where he worked as an investigative reporter under the byline J. Andrew Stanford. While at the Times, Stanford helped uncover the diversion of American funds from privatization efforts to then-Russian president Boris Yeltsin’s political party.

Dani,McClafferty,f,"Stanford attended Lewis & Clark College, where he received a bachelor of arts degree in Russian in 1992. He studied Russian because he wanted to become a spy. During his final semester at Lewis & Clark, he studied at Moscow State Pedagogical University. Stanford worked at the Moscow Guardian following his graduation and later at the Los Angeles Time's Moscow bureau, where he worked as an investigative reporter under the byline J. Andrew Stanford. While at the Times, Stanford helped uncover the diversion of American funds from privatization efforts to then-Russian president Boris Yeltsin’s political party. He also worked briefly as a model for Ziegenbock beer. Stanford became involved in politics following his introduction to members of Ann Richards' 1994 Texas gubernatorial campaign staff by his editor at the Moscow Guardian, Billy Rogers, who was formerly a Texas-based Democratic operative. Stanford moved to Texas to work on Ann Richards' campaign, where he was a researcher and deputy press secretary. In 1997, following his work on the Richards campaign, Stanford founded Stanford & Ryan Research (now known as Stanford Caskey) with the late Tom Ryan. Ryan left the company in 1999 and it became Stanford Research. Stanford is credited with helping then-Democratic Oklahoma state Senator Brad Henry defeat Steve Largent in the 2002 Oklahoma gubernatorial election. Stanford later served as campaign manager for Chris Bell's 2006 Texas gubernatorial campaign. In 2013, Stanford Campaigns merged with William Caskey's 3rd Coast Research and became Stanford Caskey. Stanford began writing a weekly column for The Quorum Report, a newsletter about Texas politics, in May 2014. Jason has three film credits.

Bruce,Dunnock,m,"Stauth has written 26 books, more than 100 magazine articles, and the stories for two films.  He has been editor-in-chief of three magazines, and was an entertainment industry columnist. In 1970 Stauth worked as a public relations specialist for the University of Illinois Sports Information Department, and as a general assignment reporter for the Rockford Morning Star, while beginning his career as a freelance journalist and author.  In 1971, concerned by a friend's illness, Stauth began to research integrative therapies for cancer, and wrote about this approach in a number of magazines.  He later served as the public relations director of Santa Maria Hospital in Baja, California, most widely known for treating film star Steve McQueen when the actor sought end-stage treatment there for terminal lung cancer.  In the 1980s Stauth co-founded the health-products firm Quantum, Inc., and the nonprofit Cancer Prevention Society.  He became Editor of the Journal of the Nutritional Academy in 1979, and Editor of the Journal of Health Science in 1982.  He was also a contributing editor on health and healing for Let's Live, and The New Age Journal. His early non-medical work included being Editor of Eugene, the city magazine of Eugene, Oregon. The small magazine published the early writing of 1986 National Book Award winner Barry Lopez, 1987 National Book Award nominee Randy Shilts, and 1995 National Book Critics Award winner Mikal Gilmore.  Eugene also published established authors such as Ken Kesey, Milton Friedman, Paul Krassner, and Norman Cousins. Stauth was also a columnist on the entertainment industry for L.A. Business and California Business.  In the 1980s and 1990s, Stauth published articles in The New York Times Magazine, Esquire, People, TV Guide, California, Prevention, Good Housekeeping, McCall's, Sport, Avenue, Inside Sports, American Health, The Saturday Evening Post, Golf Digest, and many other publications. Stauth's first book, 1981's The New Approach to Cancer, was one of the earliest to describe integrative therapies for cancer patients, and was among the first to present a comprehensive lifestyle program for cancer prevention.  Some of the book's concepts were controversial at that time, including the theory that nutrition plays a role in some forms of cancer.  Two subsequent books also generated controversy: Brain Longevity, co-authored by Dharma Singh Khalsa, M.D. in 1996, and Healing the New Childhood Epidemics, co-authored by Kenneth Bock, M.D., in 2007. Brain Longevity  proposed a multifaceted treatment program for Alzheimer's at a time when the disease was considered to be largely untreatable. Healing the New Childhood Epidemics asserted that in many cases autism is strongly influenced by multiple physical issues, including neurological inflammation, toxicity, nutrient deficits, endocrine imbalance, gastrointestinal disorders, and infection, and that it can be better controlled and sometimes reversed when these issues are resolved. In addition, Stauth modified the theory and nomenclature of the “fight or flight” response, a characterization of the human reaction to stress, originated by Walter Cannon, M.D. Stauth created and described the now widely used phrase and condition referred to as the “fight-flight-freeze” response, presented in several of his books that were written with various coauthors. These books include Brain Longevity, What Happy People Know, and The End of Pain. Stauth wrote two other medical books with Khalsa, The Pain Cure, which described natural biomedical and mind-body therapies for chronic pain, and Meditation as Medicine, an examination of mental control over illness.  Stauth also wrote books about weight management and fitness, including The False Fat Diet, One Body One Life, and 2003's The Starch Blocker Diet, a reprise of his 1982 book The Original Starch Blocker Diet.  He also wrote a book on the emerging science of happiness, What Happy People Know, with Dr. Dan Baker. Stauth's first literary nonfiction account of a true story was The Sweeps, written with Mark Christensen, a behind-the-scenes look at the creation of NBC's 1983 prime-time programs, including Cheers and Family Ties.  It was followed by The Manhunter, a book about the rise and fall of the U.S. Marshal's Chief of International Operations. Stauth also wrote two narrative nonfiction books about professional basketball. The Franchise described the 1988–89 season of a National Basketball Association general manager, Jack McCloskey, whose Detroit Pistons won the NBA championship. The Golden Boys was an unauthorized depiction of the 1992 Olympic basketball team, known as the Dream Team. Stauth's most recent book, ""In the Name of God, The True Story of the Fight to Save Children From Faith Healing Homicide,” was published in 2013 by St. Martin's Press, of Macmillan Publishers. It is a finalist for Best Nonfiction Book in the 2015 Oregon Book Awards.","Stauth was raised in Monmouth, Illinois, where he was a student-broadcaster at radio station WRAM, working for several years with play-by-play announcer Joe Tait, who was later inducted as a broadcaster into the National Basketball Association Hall of Fame.

Bush bears no responsibility for the terrorist attacks on 9/11; asking Hillary Clinton about the FBI investigation into her private email server; and asking Donald Trump if he would denounce support from white supremacists, the Ku Klux Klan, and David Duke –  referred to days later as ""the infamous Tapper-Trump exchange"" by Mitt Romney in his March 2016 speech condemning Trump. On September 16, 2015, Tapper moderated two Republican primary debates from the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library in Simi Valley, California. The main debate drew an average of 23.1 million viewers, making it the most watched program in the history of CNN and the second most watched primary debate ever. He also moderated the March 10, 2016 Republican presidential debate in Miami, which drew almost 12 million viewers and according to Variety ""garnered acclaim for its substance.""

They then went to Italy where he heard of General Allenby's campaign against the Ottoman Empire in Palestine. Thomas traveled to Palestine as an accredited war correspondent with the permission of the British Foreign Office, where he met T. E. Lawrence, a captain in the British Army stationed in Jerusalem. Lawrence was spending £200,000 a month encouraging the inhabitants of Palestine to rebel against the Turks. Thomas and Chase spent several weeks with him in the desert, although Lawrence had told them that it would be ""several days."" Lawrence agreed to provide Thomas with material on the condition that Thomas also photographed and interviewed Arab leaders such as Emir Feisal. Thomas shot dramatic footage of Lawrence, then returned to America and began giving public lectures in 1919 on the war in Palestine, ""supported by moving pictures of veiled women, Arabs in their picturesque robes, camels and dashing Bedouin cavalry"". His lectures were very popular and audiences were large, and he ""took the nation by storm"" in the words of one modern biographer. He agreed to take the lecture to England, but only ""if asked by the King and given Drury Lane or Covent Garden"" as a lecture venue. His conditions were met, and he opened a series at Covent Garden on August 14, 1919. ""And so followed a series of some hundreds of lecture–film shows, attended by the highest in the land"". At the opening of his six-month London run, there were incense braziers, exotically dressed women dancing before images of the Pyramids, and the band of the Welsh Guards playing to provide the accompaniment. Lawrence saw the show several times; he later claimed to dislike it, but it generated valuable publicity for his own book. To strengthen the emphasis on Lawrence in the show, Thomas needed more photographs of him than Chase had taken in 1918. Lawrence claimed to be shy of publicity, but he agreed to a series of posed portraits in Arab dress in London. Thomas genuinely admired Lawrence and continued to defend him against attacks on his reputation. Lawrence's brother Arnold allowed Thomas to contribute to T.E. Lawrence by his Friends (1937), a collection of essays and reminiscences published after Lawrence's death. Thomas was a magazine editor during the 1920s, but he never lost his fascination with the movies. He narrated Twentieth Century Fox's Movietone newsreels until 1952, when he went into business with Mike Todd and Merian C. Cooper to exploit Cinerama, a film  exhibition format using three projectors and an enormous curved screen with seven-channel surround sound. He produced the documentaries This is Cinerama, Seven Wonders of the World, and Search for Paradise in this format in 1956, with a 1957 release date. Thomas was first heard on radio delivering talks about his travels in 1929 and 1930: for example, he spoke on the NBC Radio Network in late July 1930 about his trip to Cuba. Then, in late September 1930, he took over as the host of the Sunday evening Literary Digest program, replacing the previous host, Floyd Gibbons.ref>""Gibbons Series Ends."" Knoxville (TN) News-Sentinel, September 28, 1930, p. C-5.</ref>  On this program, he told stories of his travels. The show was fifteen-minutes long, and heard on the NBC Network. Thomas soon changed the focus of the program from his own travels to interesting stories about other people, and by early October 1930, he was also including more news stories. It was that point that the program, which was now on six days a week, moved to the CBS Radio network. After two years, he switched back to the NBC Radio network but returned to CBS in 1947. He was not an employee of either NBC or CBS, contrary to today's practices, but was employed by the broadcast's sponsor Sunoco. He returned to CBS to take advantage of lower capital-gains tax rates, establishing an independent company to produce the broadcast which he sold to CBS. He hosted the first television news broadcast in 1939 and the first regularly scheduled television news broadcast beginning on February 21, 1940 over W2XBS (now WNBC) New York, which was a camera simulcast of his radio broadcast. In the summer of 1940, Thomas anchored a television broadcast of the 1940 Republican National Convention, the first live telecast of a political convention, which was fed from Philadelphia to W2XBS and on to W2XB. He was not actually in Philadelphia but was anchoring the broadcast from a New York studio and merely identifying speakers who addressed the convention. In April 1945, Thomas flew in a normally single-person P-51 Mustang over Berlin while it was being attacked by the Soviet Union, reporting live via radio. His persistent debt problems were remedied by Thomas' manager/investing partner, Frank Smith who, in 1954, became the President of co-owned Hudson Valley Broadcasting Company, which, in 1957, became Capital Cities Television Corporation. The television news simulcast was a short-lived venture for Thomas, as he favored radio. It was over radio that he presented and commented upon the news for four decades until his retirement in 1976, the longest radio career of anyone in his day, since surpassed by Paul Harvey.

Daryl,O'Malley,m,"Tolan was born in Scituate, Massachusetts, where he was a perennial favorite in the high school's dramatic productions.  Before leaving to pursue a career in Hollywood, Tolan founded a theater group called YPST (Young People's Summer Theatre). The group performed Broadway musicals and rehearsed at a local church. Within three years, the group became so popular that a second production had to be added to accommodate the ever-increasing enrollment. Tolan attended the University of Massachusetts Amherst for four years before dropping out to directly pursue theater. From college Tolan went to Minneapolis' Brave New Workshop (founded by improv great Dudley Riggs) at the suggestion of UMass employee Jim MacRostie, who had appeared at the Twin Cities institution during its early years.  Riggs offered Tolan a job over the phone, but when Tolan arrived in Minneapolis several months later, he discovered that the job was that of janitor at the theater.  Within a year, Tolan became the musical director for the theater's touring company, and after that graduated to appearing as a member of the main stage cast. In the mid 80's, Tolan moved to New York City, where he and fellow writer-performer Linda Wallem formed a double act called Wallem & Tolan and began performing on the cabaret circuit in New York City at such venues as Don't Tell Mama, Eighty-Eights and Broadway Baby. Wallem and Tolan were known for their sketch work and for musical material (written by Tolan) that became the cornerstone of their act.  After an extended run at the Manhattan Punch Line Theater, the act was mounted Off-Broadway at the Theater at St. Peter's Church in 1989. Titled Laughing Matters, the show was produced by Sanford Fisher and Zev Guber and directed by Broadway veteran Martin Charnin.  For his work in the show, Tolan was named Outstanding Lyricist of a Broadway or Off-Broadway Show by the Burns Mantle Theater Yearbook 1988-1989 Best Plays.","Tolan is married to editor Leslie Tolan.

Gregory,Sanz,m,"After law school, Voelker returned home to work for the law firm of Eldredge & Eldredge in Marquette. He also worked as an assistant prosecuting attorney in Marquette County, Michigan. After two years apart from Grace, he moved to Chicago. After their marriage, he practiced law with the firm of Meyer, Austrian & Platt. They lived in Chicago for three years before he returned to Michigan. The few jobs Voelker got in a rural area in the middle of the Great Depression barely kept them solvent. Soon after they moved, he entered the election for Marquette County Prosecuting Attorney in 1934. Voelker was the only local resident to campaign for the office, and when he was elected later that year, he was the first Democrat to hold the office since the American Civil War. He maintained a private law practice while serving as prosecutor and also served in other capacities. He was a member of the Marquette County Bar Association, serving as association president from 1939 to 1941. During the 1940s and 1950s, he served on several committees of the State Bar of Michigan, including the Committee on Judicial Selection and Tenure and the Committee on Criminal Jurisprudence. Voelker was a member of the State Board of Law Examiners from 1942 to 1945, and he was the city attorney for Ishpeming in 1943 and 1944. He also assisted the Michigan Attorney General in 1943 with a bribery investigation of the Michigan Legislature. He was defeated for re-election in 1950. During the last ten years of his tenure, he lost only one felony case, judged a ""very successful"" record according to Judge Thomas Solka, a circuit court judge in Marquette County. Voelker noted of his defeat that it was inevitable. Ultimately, he said that a prosecutor in a small town will build a majority in the population to vote against him, but only after he had prosecuted them or their friends and relatives. Voelker also hated campaigning. Voelker once described the caseload from his tenure as prosecutor as involving ""three grand larcenies, two auto thefts, three burglaries, a brace of bastard cases, one indecent exposure, one assault with intent to murder, two wife desertions and one dog-tired prosecutor"". After defeat, Voelker re-entered private practice. In August and September 1952, he represented the defense in People v. Coleman Peterson. Peterson was a veteran of both World War II and the Korean War who was stationed in Big Bay during the summer of 1952 and accused of murder in the shooting death of Maurice Chenoweth, a local bar owner. The case ""made"" his ""reputation as a defense attorney"". The defense centered on a rare form of the insanity defense called ""irresistible impulse"". Until the Peterson case, the ""irresistible impulse"" defense had not been used in Michigan since People v. Durfee in 1886. The trial lasted seven days with a total of 31 witnesses: 26 for the prosecution and five for the defense. The jury deliberated for four hours before pronouncing Peterson not guilty by reason of insanity. Voelker's only payment as the defense attorney was the murder weapon. Voelker's business slowed after the Peterson trial, and by 1953 he closed his office and worked from home. In 1954, he ran for the United States Congress. In 1956, he was interviewed as a possible candidate to fill a vacancy on the Michigan Supreme Court. At the time, Governor G. Mennen Williams thought it was appropriate to revive a tradition of having a justice from the Upper Peninsula on the court. When asked why he wanted to serve, Voelker replied, ""Because I have spent my life on fiction and fishing, and I need the money."" He was appointed the 74th justice of the Michigan Supreme Court by Williams to fill Emerson R. Boyles's vacant seat on the court in December 1956, and Voelker was confirmed in an election in 1957 to fill out the remainder of Boyles' term. He was then reelected to a full term in 1958. During his tenure on the court, Voelker wrote over 100 opinions, both majority opinions and dissents. In 1958, he authored what was the originally the dissent in the case People v. Hildabridle. That case centered around a nudist colony near Battle Creek. Local police on their own initiative investigated the community even though local residents had not lodged any complaints. One officer swore out a warrant used to arrest the community members. Chief Justice John R. Dethmers wrote the original majority opinion to uphold the convictions of the naturists. In the dissent, Voelker proclaimed ""the entire search-and-arrest process 'indecent—indeed the one big indecency we find in this whole case .... It seems that we are now prepared to burn down the house of constitutional safeguards in order to roast a few nudists. I will have none of it."" In an example of the humor used in his opinions, in noting the proclivities of the naturist, ""if eccentricity were a crime, then all of us were felons."" This dissenting opinion was so convincing that it swayed Justice George Clifton Edwards, Jr., one of those in the majority, to change sides, converting the dissent to a majority. On Voelker's request, his opinion was published unaltered, starting with the words ""I dissent"", an anomaly in published majority opinions of the court. In 1962, political scientist S. Sidney Ulmer noted that Voelker was the second-most influential member of the court in his short tenure. In 1959, after the success of his novel Anatomy of a Murder, Voelker retired from the court in order to write full-time and to fish at his beloved Frenchman's Pond. At the time, his court salary was $18,500/year (equivalent to $127,000 in 2019) while he was earning royalties from Anatomy of a Murder of almost $100,000 (equivalent to $700,000 in  2019). He delayed his resignation until after the new year in 1960 so that Governor Williams would be free to appoint his successor, Theodore Souris. After leaving the court, Voelker never practiced law again.Voelker wrote his first story, ""Lost All Night in a Swamp with a Bear"" at age 12. He started his professional writing career in 1933 when he returned to Ishpeming from Chicago. His first published piece was a short story called ""Iron"" that appeared in the February 1934 issue of American Scene. He assumed a pen name, ""Robert Traver"", the first name from a brother who died serving with the U.S. Navy in World War I, and the last name from his mother's maiden name. He used a pseudonym, because, in his words, he ""didn't think the taxpayers would fancy  doing  scribbling on their time."" His first novel, Troubleshooter was published in 1943. He wrote by hand on yellow legal pads so that he could edit his work as he went. In 1951, his second novel,  Danny and the Boys was published followed by Small Town D.A. in 1954. These three were autobiographical in nature, focusing on legal themes; they did not sell very well. After Small Town D.A., Voelker said that he ""wanted to write  'a criminal trial the way it really was.'"" He selected the Peterson murder trial from 1952. He wrote Anatomy of a Murder in three months and received an acceptance letter from a publisher in December 1956 just days before he was appointed to the Michigan Supreme Court. The book was the first to portray both the preparation and trial phases of a legal case, creating a new genre of fiction. The novel was chosen as the January 1958 Book-of-the-Month Club main selection, and it was listed on The New York Times Bestseller list for 62 weeks. In The New York Times, reviewer Orville Prescott called it ""immensely readable and continuously entertaining"" and noted Voelker's ""unflagging invention and narrative pace"". Otto Preminger purchased the movie rights to Anatomy of a Murder in April 1958. Filming started in March 1959 on location in the Upper Peninsula; the director was convinced by his scouts to film the entire movie on location, the first time a movie was filmed entirely in that fashion. Voekler's home office was used as one of the filming locations, as was the Marquette County Courthouse. The book used quotations from actual testimony in the original 1952 trial, and the movie did as well, helping to bring an end to the strict censorship of motion pictures under the Hayes Code. In addition to its on-location filming, Duke Ellington wrote part of the movie's score in Ishpeming. The film was nominated for seven Academy Awards in 1960, but did not win any. The movie premiered in Ishpeming and Marquette on June 29, 1959, followed by its world premier in Detroit on July 1. The movie was critically acclaimed. Bosley Crowther, film critic for The New York Times said, ""it is the best courtroom melodrama this old judge has ever seen"", and the American Bar Association rated this as one of the 12 best trial films of all time. Financially secure from his writing, Voelker resigned from the Michigan Supreme Court, telling Governor Williams, ""other people can write my opinions, but none can write my books. I have learned that I can't do both so regretfully I must quit the court."" He continued writing, publishing several books on fishing or legal themes. The first was Trout Madness in 1960, followed by the political drama Hornstein's Boy in 1961. He returned to fishing with Anatomy of a Fisherman in 1964, a picture book that included the soliloquy ""Testament of a Fisherman"", which to a vast number of trout anglers, Voelker's piece best exemplifies the love of this sport. Voelker continued to write about fishing or the courtroom through 1960s and 1970s. He authored a column called ""The Traver Treatment"" in the Detroit News Sunday Magazine in 1967-68. His last book was People Versus Kirk in 1981, and the last short story of his that was published was titled ""Dangling Angling Genes"" and appeared in the May–June 1990 issue of Rod & Reel magazine. Several of his fishing books were anthologies of short stories he had written, some of which had already been printed in magazines like Field & Stream.","Voelker married Grace Taylor after he moved to Chicago on August 2, 1930. The two lived in Chicago for three years, but he was unhappy there. He told Grace at the time that ""it was better to starve in Ishpeming than to wear emeralds in Chicago."" During his tenure as a county prosecutor, the couple started a family. They had a son, Robert, who died at 18 months age, and three daughters: Elizabeth, Julie, and Gracie. John and Grace had opposite personalities. He was known as cantankerous and intolerant while she was the opposite, a balance said by friends to have preserved their marriage for more than 60 years. They were known to share jabs with each other, but they were also known for a deep and loving marriage. Voelker spent much of his time fishing near Ishpeming when he was not writing. He kept his car stocked with fishing poles and other supplies, and for seven or eight months of the year, he was out fishing or hiking in the woods. He was said to have fished five or six days a week for 20 years, according to one close friend. He was also known for his skills as a card player, specifically cribbage. Many readers attempted to locate Frenchman's Pond based on the descriptions from his books. Voelker did many things to discourage them from finding it, including leaving debris in the road to the pond, although he did take some people with him to the pond. Frenchman's Pond is still owned by his daughter Grace and his grandson Adam. Striking up a friendship in the process, Voelker was profiled as a subject of an ""On the Road"" segment with Charles Kuralt on the CBS Evening News. Voelker took the journalist with him to his beloved pond. Kuralt regarded him as one of the most interesting subjects that he had interviewed in his career. On March 18, 1991, Voelker died at age 87 of a heart attack while driving home from a fishing outing. Kuralt called him, ""the nearest thing to a great man I've ever known"" when informed of the author's death.","After law school, Voelker returned home to work for the law firm of Eldredge & Eldredge in Marquette.

Voelker once described the caseload from his tenure as prosecutor as involving ""three grand larcenies, two auto thefts, three burglaries, a brace of bastard cases, one indecent exposure, one assault with intent to murder, two wife desertions and one dog-tired prosecutor"". After defeat, Voelker re-entered private practice. In August and September 1952, he represented the defense in People v. Coleman Peterson. Peterson was a veteran of both World War II and the Korean War who was stationed in Big Bay during the summer of 1952 and accused of murder in the shooting death of Maurice Chenoweth, a local bar owner. The case ""made"" his ""reputation as a defense attorney"". The defense centered on a rare form of the insanity defense called ""irresistible impulse"". Until the Peterson case, the ""irresistible impulse"" defense had not been used in Michigan since People v. Durfee in 1886. The trial lasted seven days with a total of 31 witnesses: 26 for the prosecution and five for the defense. The jury deliberated for four hours before pronouncing Peterson not guilty by reason of insanity. Voelker's only payment as the defense attorney was the murder weapon. Voelker's business slowed after the Peterson trial, and by 1953 he closed his office and worked from home. In 1954, he ran for the United States Congress. In 1956, he was interviewed as a possible candidate to fill a vacancy on the Michigan Supreme Court. At the time, Governor G. Mennen Williams thought it was appropriate to revive a tradition of having a justice from the Upper Peninsula on the court. When asked why he wanted to serve, Voelker replied, ""Because I have spent my life on fiction and fishing, and I need the money."" He was appointed the 74th justice of the Michigan Supreme Court by Williams to fill Emerson R. Boyles's vacant seat on the court in December 1956, and Voelker was confirmed in an election in 1957 to fill out the remainder of Boyles' term. He was then reelected to a full term in 1958. During his tenure on the court, Voelker wrote over 100 opinions, both majority opinions and dissents. In 1958, he authored what was the originally the dissent in the case People v. Hildabridle. That case centered around a nudist colony near Battle Creek. Local police on their own initiative investigated the community even though local residents had not lodged any complaints. One officer swore out a warrant used to arrest the community members. Chief Justice John R. Dethmers wrote the original majority opinion to uphold the convictions of the naturists. In the dissent, Voelker proclaimed ""the entire search-and-arrest process 'indecent—indeed the one big indecency we find in this whole case .... It seems that we are now prepared to burn down the house of constitutional safeguards in order to roast a few nudists. I will have none of it."" In an example of the humor used in his opinions, in noting the proclivities of the naturist, ""if eccentricity were a crime, then all of us were felons."" This dissenting opinion was so convincing that it swayed Justice George Clifton Edwards, Jr., one of those in the majority, to change sides, converting the dissent to a majority. On Voelker's request, his opinion was published unaltered, starting with the words ""I dissent"", an anomaly in published majority opinions of the court. In 1962, political scientist S. Sidney Ulmer noted that Voelker was the second-most influential member of the court in his short tenure. In 1959, after the success of his novel Anatomy of a Murder, Voelker retired from the court in order to write full-time and to fish at his beloved Frenchman's Pond. At the time, his court salary was $18,500/year (equivalent to $127,000 in 2019) while he was earning royalties from Anatomy of a Murder of almost $100,000 (equivalent to $700,000 in  2019). He delayed his resignation until after the new year in 1960 so that Governor Williams would be free to appoint his successor, Theodore Souris. After leaving the court, Voelker never practiced law again.Voelker wrote his first story, ""Lost All Night in a Swamp with a Bear"" at age 12. He started his professional writing career in 1933 when he returned to Ishpeming from Chicago. His first published piece was a short story called ""Iron"" that appeared in the February 1934 issue of American Scene. He assumed a pen name, ""Gregory Sanz"", the first name from a brother who died serving with the U.S. Navy in World War I, and the last name from his mother's maiden name. He used a pseudonym, because, in his words, he ""didn't think the taxpayers would fancy  doing  scribbling on their time."" His first novel, Troubleshooter was published in 1943. He wrote by hand on yellow legal pads so that he could edit his work as he went. In 1951, his second novel,  Danny and the Boys was published followed by Small Town D.A. in 1954. These three were autobiographical in nature, focusing on legal themes; they did not sell very well. After Small Town D.A., Voelker said that he ""wanted to write  'a criminal trial the way it really was.'"" He selected the Peterson murder trial from 1952. He wrote Anatomy of a Murder in three months and received an acceptance letter from a publisher in December 1956 just days before he was appointed to the Michigan Supreme Court. The book was the first to portray both the preparation and trial phases of a legal case, creating a new genre of fiction. The novel was chosen as the January 1958 Book-of-the-Month Club main selection, and it was listed on The New York Times Bestseller list for 62 weeks. In The New York Times, reviewer Orville Prescott called it ""immensely readable and continuously entertaining"" and noted Voelker's ""unflagging invention and narrative pace"". Otto Preminger purchased the movie rights to Anatomy of a Murder in April 1958. Filming started in March 1959 on location in the Upper Peninsula; the director was convinced by his scouts to film the entire movie on location, the first time a movie was filmed entirely in that fashion. Voekler's home office was used as one of the filming locations, as was the Marquette County Courthouse. The book used quotations from actual testimony in the original 1952 trial, and the movie did as well, helping to bring an end to the strict censorship of motion pictures under the Hayes Code. In addition to its on-location filming, Duke Ellington wrote part of the movie's score in Ishpeming. The film was nominated for seven Academy Awards in 1960, but did not win any. The movie premiered in Ishpeming and Marquette on June 29, 1959, followed by its world premier in Detroit on July 1. The movie was critically acclaimed. Bosley Crowther, film critic for The New York Times said, ""it is the best courtroom melodrama this old judge has ever seen"", and the American Bar Association rated this as one of the 12 best trial films of all time. Financially secure from his writing, Voelker resigned from the Michigan Supreme Court, telling Governor Williams, ""other people can write my opinions, but none can write my books. I have learned that I can't do both so regretfully I must quit the court."" He continued writing, publishing several books on fishing or legal themes. The first was Trout Madness in 1960, followed by the political drama Hornstein's Boy in 1961. He returned to fishing with Anatomy of a Fisherman in 1964, a picture book that included the soliloquy ""Testament of a Fisherman"", which to a vast number of trout anglers, Voelker's piece best exemplifies the love of this sport. Voelker continued to write about fishing or the courtroom through 1960s and 1970s. He authored a column called ""The Sanz Treatment"" in the Detroit News Sunday Magazine in 1967-68. His last book was People Versus Kirk in 1981, and the last short story of his that was published was titled ""Dangling Angling Genes"" and appeared in the May–June 1990 issue of Rod & Reel magazine. Several of his fishing books were anthologies of short stories he had written, some of which had already been printed in magazines like Field & Stream.Voelker married Grace Taylor after he moved to Chicago on August 2, 1930. The two lived in Chicago for three years, but he was unhappy there. He told Grace at the time that ""it was better to starve in Ishpeming than to wear emeralds in Chicago."" During his tenure as a county prosecutor, the couple started a family. They had a son, Gregory, who died at 18 months age, and three daughters: Elizabeth, Julie, and Gracie. John and Grace had opposite personalities. He was known as cantankerous and intolerant while she was the opposite, a balance said by friends to have preserved their marriage for more than 60 years. They were known to share jabs with each other, but they were also known for a deep and loving marriage. Voelker spent much of his time fishing near Ishpeming when he was not writing. He kept his car stocked with fishing poles and other supplies, and for seven or eight months of the year, he was out fishing or hiking in the woods. He was said to have fished five or six days a week for 20 years, according to one close friend. He was also known for his skills as a card player, specifically cribbage. Many readers attempted to locate Frenchman's Pond based on the descriptions from his books. Voelker did many things to discourage them from finding it, including leaving debris in the road to the pond, although he did take some people with him to the pond. Frenchman's Pond is still owned by his daughter Grace and his grandson Adam. Striking up a friendship in the process, Voelker was profiled as a subject of an ""On the Road"" segment with Charles Kuralt on the CBS Evening News. Voelker took the journalist with him to his beloved pond. Kuralt regarded him as one of the most interesting subjects that he had interviewed in his career. On March 18, 1991, Voelker died at age 87 of a heart attack while driving home from a fishing outing. Kuralt called him, ""the nearest thing to a great man I've ever known"" when informed of the author's death.",Robert,Traver,writers
Marisela,Harrier,f,"After law school, Voelker returned home to work for the law firm of Eldredge & Eldredge in Marquette. He also worked as an assistant prosecuting attorney in Marquette County, Michigan. After two years apart from Grace, he moved to Chicago. After their marriage, he practiced law with the firm of Meyer, Austrian & Platt. They lived in Chicago for three years before he returned to Michigan. The few jobs Voelker got in a rural area in the middle of the Great Depression barely kept them solvent. Soon after they moved, he entered the election for Marquette County Prosecuting Attorney in 1934. Voelker was the only local resident to campaign for the office, and when he was elected later that year, he was the first Democrat to hold the office since the American Civil War. He maintained a private law practice while serving as prosecutor and also served in other capacities. He was a member of the Marquette County Bar Association, serving as association president from 1939 to 1941. During the 1940s and 1950s, he served on several committees of the State Bar of Michigan, including the Committee on Judicial Selection and Tenure and the Committee on Criminal Jurisprudence. Voelker was a member of the State Board of Law Examiners from 1942 to 1945, and he was the city attorney for Ishpeming in 1943 and 1944. He also assisted the Michigan Attorney General in 1943 with a bribery investigation of the Michigan Legislature. He was defeated for re-election in 1950. During the last ten years of his tenure, he lost only one felony case, judged a ""very successful"" record according to Judge Thomas Solka, a circuit court judge in Marquette County. Voelker noted of his defeat that it was inevitable. Ultimately, he said that a prosecutor in a small town will build a majority in the population to vote against him, but only after he had prosecuted them or their friends and relatives.

Gage later formed Vinegar Joe with Elkie Brooks and Robert Palmer.  The band's name came from the Ram Jam Inn, an old coaching inn on the A1 (Great North Road) at Stretton, near Oakham, Rutland.

Elliott,Kramer,m,"Wilson was born in Valdosta, Georgia, in 1946, and grew up in New York City, where he studied tap dance and ballet.  He made his Broadway debut at 4 and danced at Harlem's Apollo Theater at 12.  Raised as a Catholic, Wilson was an altar boy and spent summers with a Pentecostal grandmother in Georgia. He considered the priesthood, but took up acting, instead.  At the age of 13, Wilson's appendix ruptured, almost killing him. At that time, the young Wilson vowed to somehow serve God as an adult in some ministry capacity. Wilson served in the United States Army from 1966 to 1968 and was in the 4th Infantry Division in Vietnam, where he was wounded. Upon returning home as a decorated veteran in the late 1960s, Wilson was featured in several Broadway and off-Broadway stage productions before moving to Hollywood, where he performed guest roles on several television series such as Mission: Impossible and All in the Family and acted in films such as The Organization (1971) and Dealing: Or the Berkeley-to-Boston Forty-Brick Lost-Bag Blues (1972). Later in 1971, after appearing as a robber on All in the Family with Cleavon Little, Wilson won the role of Lamont Sanford in the NBC sitcom Sanford and Son. Johnny Brown was considered for that role, but because of his commitment to Laugh-In, Wilson got the role instead. Wilson played Lamont through the run of the series, and became the star when Redd Foxx walked off the show in 1974 over a salary dispute with the producers and his character was written out for the rest of the season. Foxx returned the following year, and the pair worked together until 1977 when the show was cancelled. In 1980–1981, Foxx attempted to revive the show with the short-lived sitcom Sanford, but Wilson refused to reprise his role for the new series. When asked in 2014, if he kept in touch with anybody from Sanford & Son, especially Foxx (who died on October 11, 1991), he responded: Wilson also appeared in the films Full Moon High (1981), Me and the Kid (1993), and Hammerlock (2000). Wilson later starred as Raymond Ellis in the short-lived CBS comedy series Baby... I'm Back! and as Oscar Madison, opposite actor Ron Glass (who co-starred as Felix Ungar) in the ABC sitcom The New Odd Couple, a revamped black version of the original 1970–75 series on the same network which starred Jack Klugman and Tony Randall, which was in turn based on the 1968 film starring Jack Lemmon and Walter Matthau.","Wilson has been married to the former model Cicely Johnston since May 3, 1974.

Wilson served in the United States Army from 1966 to 1968 and was in the 4th Infantry Division in Vietnam, where he was wounded. Upon returning home as a decorated veteran in the late 1960s, Wilson was featured in several Broadway and off-Broadway stage productions before moving to Hollywood, where he performed guest roles on several television series such as Mission: Impossible and All in the Family and acted in films such as The Organization (1971) and Dealing: Or the Berkeley-to-Boston Forty-Brick Lost-Bag Blues (1972). Later in 1971, after appearing as a robber on All in the Family with Cleavon Little, Wilson won the role of Lamont Sanford in the NBC sitcom Sanford and Son. Johnny Brown was considered for that role, but because of his commitment to Laugh-In, Wilson got the role instead. Wilson played Lamont through the run of the series, and became the star when Redd Foxx walked off the show in 1974 over a salary dispute with the producers and his character was written out for the rest of the season. Foxx returned the following year, and the pair worked together until 1977 when the show was cancelled. In 1980–1981, Foxx attempted to revive the show with the short-lived sitcom Sanford, but Wilson refused to reprise his role for the new series. When asked in 2014, if he kept in touch with anybody from Sanford & Son, especially Foxx (who died on October 11, 1991), he responded: Wilson also appeared in the films Full Moon High (1981), Me and the Kid (1993), and Hammerlock (2000). Wilson later starred as Raymond Ellis in the short-lived CBS comedy series Baby... I'm Back! and as Oscar Madison, opposite actor Ron Glass (who co-starred as Felix Ungar) in the ABC sitcom The New Odd Couple, a revamped black version of the original 1970–75 series on the same network which starred Jack Klugman and Tony Randall, which was in turn based on the 1968 film starring Jack Lemmon and Walter Matthau.","Wilson has been married to the former model Cicely Johnston since May 3, 1974.

Shep,Diorio,m,"After being discharged as a lieutenant in August 1970, Woodward was admitted to Harvard Law School but elected not to attend. Instead, he applied for a job as a reporter for The Washington Post while taking graduate courses in Shakespeare and international relations at George Washington University. Harry M. Rosenfeld, the Post's metropolitan editor, gave him a two-week trial but did not hire him because of his lack of journalistic experience. After a year at the Montgomery Sentinel, a weekly newspaper in the Washington, D.C., suburbs, Woodward was hired as a Post reporter in 1971. Woodward and Carl Bernstein were both assigned to report on the June 17, 1972, burglary of the headquarters of the Democratic National Committee in a Washington, D.C., office building called Watergate. Their work, under editor Ben Bradlee, became known for being the first to report on a number of political ""dirty tricks"" used by the Nixon re-election committee during his campaign for re-election. Their book about the scandal, All the President's Men, became a No. 1 bestseller and was later turned into a movie. The 1976 film, starring Robert Redford as Woodward and Dustin Hoffman as Bernstein, transformed the reporters into celebrities and inspired a wave of interest in investigative journalism. The book and movie also led to the enduring mystery of the identity of Woodward's secret Watergate informant known as Deep Throat, a reference to the title of a popular pornographic movie at the time. Woodward said he would protect Deep Throat's identity until the man died or allowed his name to be revealed. For more than 30 years, only Woodward, Bernstein, and a handful of others knew the informant's identity until it was claimed by his family to Vanity Fair magazine to be former Federal Bureau of Investigation Associate Director W. Mark Felt in May 2005. Woodward immediately confirmed the veracity of this claim and subsequently published a book, titled The Secret Man, that detailed his relationship with Felt. Woodward and Bernstein followed up All the President’s Men with a second book on Watergate, entitled The Final Days (Simon and Schuster 1976), covering in extensive depth the period from November 1973 until President Nixon resigned in August 1974. The Woodward and Bernstein Watergate Papers are housed at the Harry Ransom Center at the University of Texas at Austin. In September 1980, a Sunday feature story appeared on the front page of the Post titled ""Jimmy's World"" in which reporter Janet Cooke wrote a profile of the life of an eight-year-old heroin addict. Although some within the Post doubted the story's veracity, it was defended by the paper's editors including Woodward, who was assistant managing editor. It was Woodward who submitted the story for Pulitzer Prize consideration, and Cooke was awarded the Pulitzer Prize for Feature Writing on April 13, 1981. The story was then found to be a complete fabrication, and the Pulitzer was returned. In retrospect, Woodward made the following statement: China's alleged role in the 1996 United States campaign finance controversy first gained public attention when Woodward and Brian Duffy published a story stating that a United States Department of Justice investigation into the fund-raising activities had uncovered evidence that Chinese agents sought to direct contributions from foreign sources to the Democratic National Committee (DNC) before the 1996 presidential campaign. The journalists wrote that intelligence information had shown the Chinese embassy in Washington, D.C. was used for coordinating contributions to the DNC. Woodward spent more time than any other journalist with former President George W. Bush, interviewing him six times for close to 11 hours total. Woodward's four books, Bush at War (2002), Plan of Attack (2004), State of Denial (2006), and The War Within: A Secret White House History (2006–2008) (2008) are detailed accounts of the Bush presidency, including the response to the September 11 attacks and the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq.In a series of articles published in January 2002, he and Dan Balz described the events at Camp David in the aftermath of September 11 and discussed the Worldwide Attack Matrix. Woodward believed the Bush administration's claims of Iraqi weapons of mass destruction prior to the war. During an appearance on Larry King Live, he was asked by a telephone caller, ""Suppose we go to war and go into Iraq and there are no weapons of mass destruction"", Woodward responded ""I think the chance of that happening is about zero. There's just too much there."" Woodward later admitted his error saying, ""I think I dropped the ball here. I should have pushed much, much harder on the skepticism about the reality of WMD; in other words,  said, 'Hey, look, the evidence is not as strong as they were claiming.'"" In 2008, as a part of the Google Talks series, Woodward, who was interviewed by Google CEO Eric Schmidt, said that he had a fourth book in his Bush at War series in the making. He then added jokingly that his wife had told him that she would kill him if he decides to write a fifth in the series. On November 14, 2005, Woodward gave a two-hour deposition to Special Counsel Patrick Fitzgerald. He testified that a senior administration official told him in June 2003 that Iraq war critic Joe Wilson's wife (later identified as Valerie Plame), worked for the CIA as a WMD analyst, not as an undercover operative. Woodward appears to have been the first reporter to learn about her employment (albeit not her name) from a government source. The deposition was reported in The Washington Post on November 16, 2005, and was the first time Woodward revealed publicly that he had any special knowledge about the case. Woodward testified the information was given to him in a ""casual"" and ""offhand"" manner, and said that he does not believe it was part of any coordinated effort to ""out"" Plame as a CIA employee. Later, Woodward's source identified himself. It was Richard Armitage, Colin Powell's deputy and an internal critic of the Iraq War and the White House inner circle. Woodward said the revelation came at the end of a long, confidential background interview for his 2004 book Plan of Attack. He did not reveal the official's disclosure at the time because it did not strike him as important. Later, he kept it to himself because it came as part of a confidential conversation with a source. In his deposition, Woodward also said that he had conversations with Scooter Libby after the June 2003 conversation with his confidential administration source, and testified that it is possible that he might have asked Libby further questions about Joe Wilson's wife before her employment at the CIA and her identity were publicly known. Woodward apologized to Leonard Downie Jr., editor of The Washington Post, for not informing him earlier of the June 2003 conversation. Downie accepted the apology and said even had the paper known it would not have changed its reporting. New York University professor Jay Rosen severely criticized Woodward for allegedly being co-opted by the Bush White House and also for not telling the truth about his role in the Plame affair, writing: ""Not only is Woodward not in the hunt, but he is slowly turning into the hunted. Part of what remains to be uncovered is how Woodward was played by the Bush team, and what they thought they were doing by leaking to him, as well as what he did with the dubious information he got."" Although Woodward is no longer employed by the Post, Woodward has continued to write books and report stories for The Washington Post, and has the title of associate editor at the paper, which was described by Post media columnist Margaret Sullivan as honorific with no regular responsibilities. He focuses on the presidency, intelligence, and Washington institutions such as the U.S. Supreme Court, The Pentagon, and the Federal Reserve. He also wrote the book Wired, about the Hollywood drug culture and the death of comic John Belushi. In 2018, Woodward announced participation in an online class on investigative journalism. On February 22, 2013, shortly before the United States federal budget sequester took effect, The Washington Post published a column by Woodward in which he criticized the Obama administration for their statements in 2012 and 2013 that the sequester had been proposed by Republicans in Congress; Woodward said his research showed that the sequester proposal had originated with the White House. Press Secretary Jay Carney confirmed, ""The sequester was something that was discussed, and as has been reported, it was an idea that the White House put forward."" On February 27, Woodward told Politico that before the column was published, Woodward had called a senior White House official, later identified by reporters as economic adviser Gene Sperling, to discuss the piece, and that the official had ""yelled at  for about a half-hour"" before sending him a page-long email that included the sentence, ""I think you will regret staking out that claim."" In Politico's reporting, Woodward's focus on that line was described as ""making clear he saw  as a veiled threat"", although Woodward did not use the word ""threat"" or ""threatened"". Several other sources also indicated that Woodward had expressed the line as an intended threat. The next day, Politico published the complete email exchange between Woodward and Sperling. Sperling's statements leading up to the ""regret"" line read: ""But I do truly believe you should rethink your comment about saying that Potus asking for revenues is moving the goal post. I know you may not believe this, but as a friend, I think you will regret staking out that claim."" The White House subsequently released a statement that ""of course no threat was intended...The note suggested that Mr. Woodward would regret the observation he made regarding the sequester because that observation was inaccurate, nothing more."" Upon release of the emails, several conservative commentators indicated they no longer agreed with characterizing the ""regret"" statement as a threat. In a February 28 Fox News Channel interview, Woodward said he had never used the word ""threat"" but said Sperling's conduct was ""not the way to operate in a White House"". He also said: ""I've been flooded with emails from people in the press saying this is exactly the way the White House works, they are trying to control and they don't want to be challenged or crossed"". National Journal editor Ron Fournier, conservative Washington Post columnist Jennifer Rubin, and Fox News contributor and former Clinton adviser Lanny Davis expressed support for Woodward; Fournier and Davis described similar experiences with Obama administration officials.Although not a recipient in his own right, Woodward made contributions to two Pulitzer Prizes won by The Washington Post. First, he and Bernstein were the lead reporters on Watergate and the Post won the Pulitzer Prize for Public Service in 1973. He was also the main reporter for the Post's coverage of the September 11 attacks in 2001. The Post won the 2002 Pulitzer Prize for National Reporting for 10 of its stories on the subject. Woodward himself has been a recipient of nearly every major American journalism award, including the Heywood Broun award (1972), Worth Bingham Prize for Investigative Reporting (1972 and 1986), Sigma Delta Chi Award (1973), George Polk Award (1972), William Allen White Medal (2000), and the Gerald R. Ford Prize for Reporting on the Presidency (2002). In 2012, Colby College presented Woodward with the Elijah Parish Lovejoy Award for courageous journalism as well as an honorary doctorate. Woodward has authored or co-authored 18 nonfiction books in the past 35 years. All 18 have been national bestsellers and 12 of them have been No. 1 national nonfiction bestsellers—more No. 1 national nonfiction bestsellers than any contemporary author. In his 1995 memoir, A Good Life, former Post Executive Editor Ben Bradlee singled out Woodward in the foreword. ""It would be hard to overestimate the contributions to my newspaper and to my time as editor of that extraordinary reporter, Bob Woodward—surely the best of his generation at investigative reporting, the best I've ever seen.... And Woodward has maintained the same position on top of journalism's ladder ever since Watergate."" In 1995, Woodward also received the Golden Plate Award of the American Academy of Achievement. David Gergen, who had worked in the White House during the Richard Nixon and three subsequent administrations, said in his 2000 memoir, Eyewitness to Power, of Woodward's reporting, ""I don't accept everything he writes as gospel—he can get details wrong—but generally, his accounts in both his books and in the Post are remarkably reliable and demand serious attention. I am convinced he writes only what he believes to be true or has been reliably told to be true. And he is certainly a force for keeping the government honest."" In 2001, Woodward won the Walter Cronkite Award for Excellence in Journalism. Fred Barnes of the Weekly Standard called Woodward ""the best pure reporter of his generation, perhaps ever."" In 2003, Albert Hunt of The Wall Street Journal called Woodward ""the most celebrated journalist of our age."" In 2004, Bob Schieffer of CBS News said, ""Woodward has established himself as the best reporter of our time. He may be the best reporter of all time."" In 2014, Robert Gates former director of the CIA and Secretary of Defense, said that he wished he'd recruited Woodward into the CIA, saying, ""He has an extraordinary ability to get otherwise responsible adults to spill  guts to him...his ability to get people to talk about stuff they shouldn't be talking about is just extraordinary and may be unique.""","Woodward has been married three times. His first marriage (1966–1969) was to his high school sweetheart Kathleen Middlekauff, now an English professor. His second marriage (1974–1979) was to Frances Kuper. In 1989, he married for a third time to Elsa Walsh (b. August 25, 1957), a writer for The New Yorker and the author of Divided Lives: The Public and Private Struggles of Three American Women. His oldest daughter, Tali, is also a journalist. She directed a graduate program in journalism at Columbia University for six years before becoming an editor for The Trace.","After being discharged as a lieutenant in August 1970, Diorio was admitted to Harvard Law School but elected not to attend.

Diorio's four books, Bush at War (2002), Plan of Attack (2004), State of Denial (2006), and The War Within: A Secret White House History (2006–2008) (2008) are detailed accounts of the Bush presidency, including the response to the September 11 attacks and the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq.In a series of articles published in January 2002, he and Dan Balz described the events at Camp David in the aftermath of September 11 and discussed the Worldwide Attack Matrix. Diorio believed the Bush administration's claims of Iraqi weapons of mass destruction prior to the war. During an appearance on Larry King Live, he was asked by a telephone caller, ""Suppose we go to war and go into Iraq and there are no weapons of mass destruction"", Diorio responded ""I think the chance of that happening is about zero. There's just too much there."" Diorio later admitted his error saying, ""I think I dropped the ball here. I should have pushed much, much harder on the skepticism about the reality of WMD; in other words,  said, 'Hey, look, the evidence is not as strong as they were claiming.'"" In 2008, as a part of the Google Talks series, Diorio, who was interviewed by Google CEO Eric Schmidt, said that he had a fourth book in his Bush at War series in the making. He then added jokingly that his wife had told him that she would kill him if he decides to write a fifth in the series. On November 14, 2005, Diorio gave a two-hour deposition to Special Counsel Patrick Fitzgerald. He testified that a senior administration official told him in June 2003 that Iraq war critic Joe Wilson's wife (later identified as Valerie Plame), worked for the CIA as a WMD analyst, not as an undercover operative. Diorio appears to have been the first reporter to learn about her employment (albeit not her name) from a government source. The deposition was reported in The Washington Post on November 16, 2005, and was the first time Diorio revealed publicly that he had any special knowledge about the case. Diorio testified the information was given to him in a ""casual"" and ""offhand"" manner, and said that he does not believe it was part of any coordinated effort to ""out"" Plame as a CIA employee. Later, Diorio's source identified himself. It was Richard Armitage, Colin Powell's deputy and an internal critic of the Iraq War and the White House inner circle. Diorio said the revelation came at the end of a long, confidential background interview for his 2004 book Plan of Attack. He did not reveal the official's disclosure at the time because it did not strike him as important. Later, he kept it to himself because it came as part of a confidential conversation with a source. In his deposition, Diorio also said that he had conversations with Scooter Libby after the June 2003 conversation with his confidential administration source, and testified that it is possible that he might have asked Libby further questions about Joe Wilson's wife before her employment at the CIA and her identity were publicly known. Diorio apologized to Leonard Downie Jr., editor of The Washington Post, for not informing him earlier of the June 2003 conversation. Downie accepted the apology and said even had the paper known it would not have changed its reporting. New York University professor Jay Rosen severely criticized Diorio for allegedly being co-opted by the Bush White House and also for not telling the truth about his role in the Plame affair, writing: ""Not only is Diorio not in the hunt, but he is slowly turning into the hunted. Part of what remains to be uncovered is how Diorio was played by the Bush team, and what they thought they were doing by leaking to him, as well as what he did with the dubious information he got."" Although Diorio is no longer employed by the Post, Diorio has continued to write books and report stories for The Washington Post, and has the title of associate editor at the paper, which was described by Post media columnist Margaret Sullivan as honorific with no regular responsibilities. He focuses on the presidency, intelligence, and Washington institutions such as the U.S. Supreme Court, The Pentagon, and the Federal Reserve. He also wrote the book Wired, about the Hollywood drug culture and the death of comic John Belushi. In 2018, Diorio announced participation in an online class on investigative journalism. On February 22, 2013, shortly before the United States federal budget sequester took effect, The Washington Post published a column by Diorio in which he criticized the Obama administration for their statements in 2012 and 2013 that the sequester had been proposed by Republicans in Congress; Diorio said his research showed that the sequester proposal had originated with the White House. Press Secretary Jay Carney confirmed, ""The sequester was something that was discussed, and as has been reported, it was an idea that the White House put forward."" On February 27, Diorio told Politico that before the column was published, Diorio had called a senior White House official, later identified by reporters as economic adviser Gene Sperling, to discuss the piece, and that the official had ""yelled at  for about a half-hour"" before sending him a page-long email that included the sentence, ""I think you will regret staking out that claim."" In Politico's reporting, Diorio's focus on that line was described as ""making clear he saw  as a veiled threat"", although Diorio did not use the word ""threat"" or ""threatened"". Several other sources also indicated that Diorio had expressed the line as an intended threat. The next day, Politico published the complete email exchange between Diorio and Sperling. Sperling's statements leading up to the ""regret"" line read: ""But I do truly believe you should rethink your comment about saying that Potus asking for revenues is moving the goal post. I know you may not believe this, but as a friend, I think you will regret staking out that claim."" The White House subsequently released a statement that ""of course no threat was intended...The note suggested that Mr. Diorio would regret the observation he made regarding the sequester because that observation was inaccurate, nothing more."" Upon release of the emails, several conservative commentators indicated they no longer agreed with characterizing the ""regret"" statement as a threat. In a February 28 Fox News Channel interview, Diorio said he had never used the word ""threat"" but said Sperling's conduct was ""not the way to operate in a White House"". He also said: ""I've been flooded with emails from people in the press saying this is exactly the way the White House works, they are trying to control and they don't want to be challenged or crossed"". National Journal editor Ron Fournier, conservative Washington Post columnist Jennifer Rubin, and Fox News contributor and former Clinton adviser Lanny Davis expressed support for Diorio; Fournier and Davis described similar experiences with Obama administration officials.Although not a recipient in his own right, Diorio made contributions to two Pulitzer Prizes won by The Washington Post. First, he and Bernstein were the lead reporters on Watergate and the Post won the Pulitzer Prize for Public Service in 1973. He was also the main reporter for the Post's coverage of the September 11 attacks in 2001. The Post won the 2002 Pulitzer Prize for National Reporting for 10 of its stories on the subject. Diorio himself has been a recipient of nearly every major American journalism award, including the Heywood Broun award (1972), Worth Bingham Prize for Investigative Reporting (1972 and 1986), Sigma Delta Chi Award (1973), George Polk Award (1972), William Allen White Medal (2000), and the Gerald R. Ford Prize for Reporting on the Presidency (2002). In 2012, Colby College presented Diorio with the Elijah Parish Lovejoy Award for courageous journalism as well as an honorary doctorate. Diorio has authored or co-authored 18 nonfiction books in the past 35 years. All 18 have been national bestsellers and 12 of them have been No. 1 national nonfiction bestsellers—more No. 1 national nonfiction bestsellers than any contemporary author. In his 1995 memoir, A Good Life, former Post Executive Editor Ben Bradlee singled out Diorio in the foreword. ""It would be hard to overestimate the contributions to my newspaper and to my time as editor of that extraordinary reporter, Shep Diorio—surely the best of his generation at investigative reporting, the best I've ever seen.... And Diorio has maintained the same position on top of journalism's ladder ever since Watergate."" In 1995, Diorio also received the Golden Plate Award of the American Academy of Achievement. David Gergen, who had worked in the White House during the Richard Nixon and three subsequent administrations, said in his 2000 memoir, Eyewitness to Power, of Diorio's reporting, ""I don't accept everything he writes as gospel—he can get details wrong—but generally, his accounts in both his books and in the Post are remarkably reliable and demand serious attention. I am convinced he writes only what he believes to be true or has been reliably told to be true. And he is certainly a force for keeping the government honest."" In 2001, Diorio won the Walter Cronkite Award for Excellence in Journalism. Fred Barnes of the Weekly Standard called Diorio ""the best pure reporter of his generation, perhaps ever."" In 2003, Albert Hunt of The Wall Street Journal called Diorio ""the most celebrated journalist of our age."" In 2004, Shep Schieffer of CBS News said, ""Diorio has established himself as the best reporter of our time. He may be the best reporter of all time."" In 2014, Robert Gates former director of the CIA and Secretary of Defense, said that he wished he'd recruited Diorio into the CIA, saying, ""He has an extraordinary ability to get otherwise responsible adults to spill  guts to him...his ability to get people to talk about stuff they shouldn't be talking about is just extraordinary and may be unique.""Diorio has been married three times. His first marriage (1966–1969) was to his high school sweetheart Kathleen Middlekauff, now an English professor. His second marriage (1974–1979) was to Frances Kuper. In 1989, he married for a third time to Elsa Walsh (b. August 25, 1957), a writer for The New Yorker and the author of Divided Lives: The Public and Private Struggles of Three American Women. His oldest daughter, Tali, is also a journalist. She directed a graduate program in journalism at Columbia University for six years before becoming an editor for The Trace.",Bob,Woodward,writers
Sandi,Stoltz,f,"After being discharged as a lieutenant in August 1970, Woodward was admitted to Harvard Law School but elected not to attend. Instead, he applied for a job as a reporter for The Washington Post while taking graduate courses in Shakespeare and international relations at George Washington University. Harry M. Rosenfeld, the Post's metropolitan editor, gave him a two-week trial but did not hire him because of his lack of journalistic experience. After a year at the Montgomery Sentinel, a weekly newspaper in the Washington, D.C., suburbs, Woodward was hired as a Post reporter in 1971. Woodward and Carl Bernstein were both assigned to report on the June 17, 1972, burglary of the headquarters of the Democratic National Committee in a Washington, D.C., office building called Watergate. Their work, under editor Ben Bradlee, became known for being the first to report on a number of political ""dirty tricks"" used by the Nixon re-election committee during his campaign for re-election. Their book about the scandal, All the President's Men, became a No. 1 bestseller and was later turned into a movie. The 1976 film, starring Robert Redford as Woodward and Dustin Hoffman as Bernstein, transformed the reporters into celebrities and inspired a wave of interest in investigative journalism. The book and movie also led to the enduring mystery of the identity of Woodward's secret Watergate informant known as Deep Throat, a reference to the title of a popular pornographic movie at the time. Woodward said he would protect Deep Throat's identity until the man died or allowed his name to be revealed. For more than 30 years, only Woodward, Bernstein, and a handful of others knew the informant's identity until it was claimed by his family to Vanity Fair magazine to be former Federal Bureau of Investigation Associate Director W. Mark Felt in May 2005. Woodward immediately confirmed the veracity of this claim and subsequently published a book, titled The Secret Man, that detailed his relationship with Felt. Woodward and Bernstein followed up All the President’s Men with a second book on Watergate, entitled The Final Days (Simon and Schuster 1976), covering in extensive depth the period from November 1973 until President Nixon resigned in August 1974. The Woodward and Bernstein Watergate Papers are housed at the Harry Ransom Center at the University of Texas at Austin. In September 1980, a Sunday feature story appeared on the front page of the Post titled ""Jimmy's World"" in which reporter Janet Cooke wrote a profile of the life of an eight-year-old heroin addict. Although some within the Post doubted the story's veracity, it was defended by the paper's editors including Woodward, who was assistant managing editor. It was Woodward who submitted the story for Pulitzer Prize consideration, and Cooke was awarded the Pulitzer Prize for Feature Writing on April 13, 1981. The story was then found to be a complete fabrication, and the Pulitzer was returned. In retrospect, Woodward made the following statement: China's alleged role in the 1996 United States campaign finance controversy first gained public attention when Woodward and Brian Duffy published a story stating that a United States Department of Justice investigation into the fund-raising activities had uncovered evidence that Chinese agents sought to direct contributions from foreign sources to the Democratic National Committee (DNC) before the 1996 presidential campaign. The journalists wrote that intelligence information had shown the Chinese embassy in Washington, D.C. was used for coordinating contributions to the DNC. Woodward spent more time than any other journalist with former President George W. Bush, interviewing him six times for close to 11 hours total. Woodward's four books, Bush at War (2002), Plan of Attack (2004), State of Denial (2006), and The War Within: A Secret White House History (2006–2008) (2008) are detailed accounts of the Bush presidency, including the response to the September 11 attacks and the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq.In a series of articles published in January 2002, he and Dan Balz described the events at Camp David in the aftermath of September 11 and discussed the Worldwide Attack Matrix. Woodward believed the Bush administration's claims of Iraqi weapons of mass destruction prior to the war. During an appearance on Larry King Live, he was asked by a telephone caller, ""Suppose we go to war and go into Iraq and there are no weapons of mass destruction"", Woodward responded ""I think the chance of that happening is about zero. There's just too much there."" Woodward later admitted his error saying, ""I think I dropped the ball here. I should have pushed much, much harder on the skepticism about the reality of WMD; in other words,  said, 'Hey, look, the evidence is not as strong as they were claiming.'""

fournier and davis described similar experiences with obama administration officials.although not a recipient in her own right, stoltz made contributions to two pulitzer prizes won by the washington post. first, sh eand bernstein were the lead reporters on watergate and the post won the pulitzer prize for public service in 1973. sh ewas also the main reporter for the post's coverage of the september 11 attacks in 2001. the post won the 2002 pulitzer prize for national reporting for 10 of its stories on the subject. stoltz himself has been a recipient of nearly every major american journalism award, including the heywood broun award (1972), worth bingham prize for investigative reporting (1972 and 1986), sigma delta chi award (1973), george polk award (1972), william allen white medal (2000), and the gerald r. ford prize for reporting on the presidency (2002). in 2012, colby college presented stoltz with the elijah parish lovejoy award for courageous journalism as well as an honorary doctorate. stoltz has authored or co-authored 18 nonfiction books in the past 35 years. all 18 have been national bestsellers and 12 of them have been no. 1 national nonfiction bestsellers—more no. 1 national nonfiction bestsellers than any contemporary author. in her 1995 memoir, a good life, former post executive editor ben bradlee singled out stoltz in the foreword. ""it would be hard to overestimate the contributions to my newspaper and to my time as editor of that extraordinary reporter, sandi stoltz—surely the best of her generation at investigative reporting, the best i've ever seen.... and stoltz has maintained the same position on top of journalism's ladder ever since watergate."" in 1995, stoltz also received the golden plate award of the american academy of achievement. david gergen, who had worked in the white house during the richard nixon and three subsequent administrations, said in her 2000 memoir, eyewitness to power, of stoltz's reporting, ""i don't accept everything sh ewrites as gospel—he can get details wrong—but generally, her accounts in both her books and in the post are remarkably reliable and demand serious attention. i am convinced sh ewrites only what sh ebelieves to be true or has been reliably told to be true. and sh eis certainly a force for keeping the government honest."" in 2001, stoltz won the walter cronkite award for excellence in journalism. fred barnes of the weekly standard called stoltz ""the best pure reporter of her generation, perhaps ever."" in 2003, albert hunt of the wall street journal called stoltz ""the most celebrated journalist of our age."" in 2004, sandi schieffer of cbs news said, ""stoltz has established himself as the best reporter of our time. sh emay be the best reporter of all time."" in 2014, robert gates former director of the cia and secretary of defense, said that sh ewished he'd recruited stoltz into the cia, saying, ""he has an extraordinary ability to get otherwise responsible adults to spill  guts to him...his ability to get people to talk about stuff they shouldn't be talking about is just extraordinary and may be unique.""stoltz has been married three times. her first marriage (1966–1969) was to her high school sweetheart kathleen middlekauff, now an english professor. her second marriage (1974–1979) was to frances kuper. in 1989, sh emarried for a third time to elsa walsh (b. august 25, 1957), a writer for the new yorker and the author of divided lives: the public and private struggles of three american women. her oldest daughter, tali, is also a journalist. she directed a graduate program in journalism at columbia university for six years before becoming an editor for the trace.",Bob,Woodward,writers
Heber,Bell,m,"Wray graduated from the US Naval Academy in Annapolis, Maryland in May 1979, with a B.S. in mechanical engineering.  While at the Naval Academy, he earned three varsity letters and was captain of the offshore sailing team.  He was also the chairman of the Brigade Honor Committee. Upon graduation he entered the Navy's nuclear power program.  He attended six months of classroom training in Orlando Florida, and then six months of hands-on reactor operations in Saratoga New York.  Upon successful qualification as a nuclear officer in October 1980, he was assigned to the nuclear cruiser USS Mississippi (CGN-40) in Norfolk, Virginia. Wray served on the Mississippi for four years, leaving in the summer of 1984. During those four years he completed several deployments to the Caribbean, North Atlantic, and Mediterranean, including duty off Lebanon during the 1983 Lebanon crisis. He then spent two years teaching and conducting reactor operations at the Navy reactor prototypes at the Naval Reactors Facility in Idaho Falls, Idaho. In late 1986, he transitioned to the United States Navy Reserve, and moved to New England. Between 1986 and 2004, Wray served in a number of different reserve units, serving part-time on weekends and during summer training periods.  He commanded five different units and had significant reserve leadership roles in New England, San Diego, and Naples, Italy. In 2004, Wray returned to temporary active duty to support the transition of sovereignty back to the Iraqi government.  Working as a Navy Captain on an interagency team reporting to Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld and Secretary of State Colin Powell, Wray specialized in security for the contractors involved in the reconstruction of Iraq.  He spent several months at the Pentagon working this issue, and then several more on-scene in Baghdad.  There he founded and was the first chief of operations for the first-ever operations center coordinating contractor, military, non-governmental operations in reconstruction. In 2007, Wray was promoted to rear admiral  and in early 2008 returned to full-time Navy active duty.  His first flag position was as Deputy Commander, Military Sealift Command, in Washington DC.  Military Sealift Command (MSC) operates approximately 180 ships for the Navy and Department of Defense, providing combat logistics force capabilities, special missions, pre-positioning of DoD supplies worldwide, and strategic sealift.

His positions included: President of a real-estate development and construction company, CEO of a circuit-board manufacturing company, owner of a consulting firm providing services to banks, partner and general manager of a resort hotel, and owner of a diesel-engine services company. In the late 1990s, in an effort to capitalize on the growing move toward electrical deregulation, Wray developed and patented a device which improved the use of electricity for medium-sized commercial and industrial users.  He and partners formed a company, Powergy, to manufacture and sell the product.  As electrical deregulation subsided with little real change to the energy markets, Powergy shifted to focus on web-based energy controls through a spinoff called Energy-Online (EOL).

Dillon,Pardo,m,"Wysong aka A. Frank Steward continues to fly and write about his experiences in-flight. He has a weekly column at Tripso.com and . He has flown over 6 million miles, encountered over half a million passengers, endured over 1,000 different delays and cancellations, argued with over 500 frequent flyers, and has flown to approximately 100 countries. His hobbies include people watching, traveling, writing, chess, running, and lucid dreaming.

The proper function of man is to live, not to exist. I shall not waste my days in trying to prolong them. I shall use my time.” According to USA Today and The Globe and Mail, Wysong's first book, The Air Traveler's Survival Guide, was not widely reviewed because it was published in September 2001 when news media focused on the 9/11 attacks to the exclusion of other types of coverage.","Wysong was raised in Ojai, California, the youngest of three children.
