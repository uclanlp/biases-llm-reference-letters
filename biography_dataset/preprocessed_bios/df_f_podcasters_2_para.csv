Taryn,Bancroft,f,"At the age of 17, Lewis worked at a Tampa department store. To make money, she began breeding show cats; she also began rescuing bobcats, and used llamas for a lawn trimming business. In January 1991, she married her second husband and joined his real estate business. As Carole Lewis, she and her husband Don founded Wildlife on Easy Street, an animal sanctuary near Tampa for big cats, in 1992. She is the current chief executive officer of the sanctuary, which she renamed to Big Cat Rescue sometime after Lewis's disappearance in 1997. She has used social media such as Facebook and YouTube and her ""The Cat Chat"" podcast to promote activism against private zoos. The New York Times and The Hollywood Reporter have described her as an animal rights activist. In 2020, Baskin was cast in season 29 of Dancing with the Stars.  On the series' September 14 season premiere she danced a paso with partner Pasha Pashkov to Survivor's Eye of the Tiger and they received a 11 out of a possible 30, the lowest cumulative score of the evening.  Meanwhile, during the broadcast in select Florida television markets, including Tampa, Lewis' family and their attorney ran and appeared in a commercial spot asking for anyone with information on his disappearance to come forward and offered a hundred-thousand dollar reward.","She moved in with Michael Murdock, her boss at the department store where she worked, when she was 17. The couple married on April 7, 1979. Baskin has said that she never loved him and married him only because her parents were disappointed that they had been living together outside of marriage. She became pregnant soon after, and daughter Jamie Veronica Murdock was born on July 16, 1980. According to Baskin, in 1981, when she was 19, she threw a potato at Murdock as he attempted to attack her. She ran out of their home barefoot and met her next husband, Don Lewis, on Nebraska Avenue in Tampa. She and Lewis engaged in an affair while both were still married. She became one of Lewis's many girlfriends and substantially grew his wealth by helping him buy and sell real estate in 1984. The pair divorced their respective spouses and subsequently married in 1991. According to Baskin, Lewis was obsessed with sex and would frequently fly to Costa Rica, where he had substantial real estate holdings, to have affairs – timing the trips for whenever she was menstruating. In July 1997, Lewis filed a restraining order against her, claiming that she had threatened to kill him; the restraining order was rejected. Baskin claims that he filed the restraining order because she would haul off some of his ""junk"" property whenever he visited Costa Rica. Lewis continued to live with Baskin afterwards. Lewis told her multiple times that he wanted a divorce, but she did not think he was ever serious about it. She claimed he was diagnosed with bipolar disorder months before he vanished. Lewis disappeared in August 1997 and was declared legally dead in 2002. A dispute ensued between Baskin and Lewis's children over the estate, with Baskin prevailing as the primary inheritor. The case of his disappearance is still open as of 2020. She met Howard Baskin in November 2002 at a kick-off party for the newly formed No More Homeless Pets organization.

Previously, Gay was the Director of Technology and Citizen Science for the Astronomical Society of the Pacific, and prior to that, an assistant research professor in the STEM center at Southern Illinois University Edwardsville. Gay was on the Council (Board of Directors) for the American Association of Variable Star Observers, as well as its Educational Committee Chair. Gay was co-chair of the United States new media efforts with regard to the International Year of Astronomy, 2009. Gay's research interests focus primarily on motivating science engagement with media and citizen scientists, as well as data analysis and visualization to engage the public as partners in the analysis of large data sets. Other research interests include RR Lyrae stars with which she collaborates with both professional and amateur astronomers across the world in order to gather needed data. While Gay is known for her citizen science and educational outreach work, much of her research has been in galactic astronomy. Gay's work with David Lambert provided confirmation that magnesium (Mg) isotopes are primarily a product of nucleosynthesis in massive stars, and demonstrated that some stars with known ""anomalous or peculiar composition are also marked by distinctive isotopic Mg abundances."" Gay and Lambert's results have been further cited in research of properties of the fine-structure constant using absorption systems in the spectra of distant quasars. Gay's work on communication of astronomy has investigated educational trends involving the use of podcasting, using the Slacker Astronomy podcast as a case study. Researchers at the University of Sydney, Australia cited the study, examining podcasting as a means of supporting instruction, leveraging its advantages against student time constraints and potential bandwidth limitations. Gay's work on Exploring the Motivations of Citizen Science  Volunteers examined the Zooniverse project, which developed from the Galaxy Zoo initiative, which started in 2007. Researchers citing this study concluded that ""ublic response was extremely positive,"" garnering over 60 million classifications.

Crater counting is described as ""a valuable exercise, but it's hard to automate."" Surface features, such as the size and degradation of craters, are identified by individual users and submitted back to the project, where they are collected alongside the contributions of other citizen scientists. CosmoQuest projects have included Planet Mappers, Moon Mappers, Asteroid Mappers, and a future project, Planet Investigators.

Her illustrations and writings have been published in print and online periodicals including The New York Times, McSweeney's, Vanity Fair, and Lucky Peach magazine. From 2011 through 2013, she was a regular contributor to The Hairpin and produced a series of illustrated film reviews. Her first comic series, I Want You, was published in 2009 by Buenaventura Press. In 2010, Hanawalt was the first woman to win an Ignatz Award for Outstanding Comic, for ""I Want You #1."" In 2012, she illustrated her first children's book, Benny's Brigade, published by McSweeney's and authored by Arthur Bradford. The book stars a tiny talking walrus, rescued by two sisters with a range of magical animals at the end of the quest. The book was named a ""Wildest Book of the Year"" by children's lit blog 100 Scope Notes and called ""exuberant and imaginative"" by Foreword Reviews. The book's jacket reverse folds out into an oversized poster featuring Hanawalt's creatures from the book.  In 2013, Drawn and Quarterly published My Dirty Dumb Eyes, Hanawalt's ""one-woman anthology"" of comics and illustrations, including previously-commissioned works. The collected stories and shorts range from autobiographical narratives to cultural observations, frequently featuring anthropomorphic animal-people and scenes of nature rendered in bright, detailed watercolors, and likened by one reviewer to ""a grown-up Richard Scarry turned absurdist social commentator."" In 2016, Drawn and Quarterly published Hot Dog Taste Test. This book is a collection of comics and illustrations often featuring animal-people in vibrant watercolors. Publishers Weekly said about her book, ""Hanawalt takes a kebab skewer to the pomposity that's grown up around food and dining. The cartoons evoke an idiosyncratic absurdity akin to Roz Chast's work."" On August 21, 2018, Hanawalt released a graphic novel with Drawn and Quarterly entitled Coyote Doggirl. Unlike her previous two, Coyote Doggirl features a singular narrative and  follows its titular character and her trusty steed, Red, on their escape from a vengeful bulldog and his cronies. In 2019, Drawn and Quarterly announced that they would be releasing a collection of Hanawalt's early comics, I Want You, with a contemporary introduction. The Netflix animated television series BoJack Horseman, which debuted in 2014, is designed by Hanawalt. She has been friends with show creator Raphael Bob-Waksberg since high school and previously worked with him on the webcomic Tip Me Over, Pour Me Out. In 2019, Netflix released Tuca & Bertie, an adult animated comedy created by Hanawalt, starring Tiffany Haddish and Ali Wong. Critics called Tuca & Bertie one of the best new shows of 2019, and the show holds a rating of 100% on the review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes. Netflix cancelled the series after its first season, however the show was revived by Adult Swim in 2020.","Her longtime partner is comedian Adam Conover.

Carlo,Zomorodi,m,"Hanawalt was born in Palo Alto, California, to Stanford biologists Philip Hanawalt and Graciela Spivak. Her mother was born and raised in Argentina by a family of Jewish refugees originally from Odessa. She is a former member of Pizza Island, a cartoonist's studio in Greenpoint, Brooklyn, which included cartoonists Kate Beaton, Domitille Collardey, Sarah Glidden, Meredith Gran, and Julia Wertz.

Carroll,Parenti,f,"In her teens Henderson released a single called Give it up Baby Heather using her Dance Party moniker. Billboard magazine reviewed the single and said that it is ""Empowered with a sturdy voice and promising blend of style and attitude"". And, ""... her voice is put to good use... with a Paula Abdul like chorus."" Henderson, as a fan of Penn Jillette, invited him to listen to some of her music and watch some of her videos, and soon after, they became friends. Jillette asked her to join his No God Band to perform at the yearly James Randi skeptic convention, The Amaz!ng Meeting. She has recorded background vocals for the songs, ""Clay Aiken by Penn Jillette"", ""I Quit My Job - Love Theme from Director's Cut"" and ""Penn's Sunday School Theme"". The No God Band performed at The Amaz!ng Meeting in 2011-2014. At Jillette's Bacon and Donut party, he described the event: '""There will be obscenity, there will be scantily clad people, there will be bacon, there will be donuts, you will learn nothing.""' Henderson has said she is not interested in a career as a singer, but will perform when asked. She does backup for Penn Jillette and for other projects by friends. She sings in an atheist choir in Los Angeles called the Voices of Reason Choir.Henderson worked from 1993 to 2010 in the erotica industry, stripping, burlesque, foot fetish parties, as a dominatrix and lap dancing. She wanted to be all things to people, ""I'm hustling to be the everything girl."" She wanted to be on stage and she was comfortable with her sexuality. She felt that this might be a great way to express herself while making money. Known as Baby Heather, Henderson sported a mohawk or sometimes a shaven head. Henderson got involved with burlesque after a friend who was doing a ""variety"" show asked her to sing background.  ""I became hooked! It was the kind of place where I could perform the silly to the sexy, and I made a whole new group of friends."" In 2007, Henderson performed with the Peek-A-Boo Revue burlesque troupe and appeared at the monthly event Pousse Cafe' in Philadelphia, when she explained her philosophy of burlesque. She stated that in this environment shy women (in time) are, ""dancing around naked and doing cartwheels..."" The other workers help each other out by boosting confidence and paying attention to egos. ""Shy performers end up being molded into brazen unafraid actors and dancers."" Henderson states that burlesque is about making fun of sex, ""It's not so serious."" She eventually grew tired of the disrespect from club owners and customers and decided to get out of the trade in 2010. ""Men come in there and they act like they don't know why we're there. Stop staring, give us a tip. We're working,"" she says. Henderson felt that men were there for ""faceless treats"" and didn't understand that the industry is all about ""fantasy with mutual respect."" She states that she misses the experience, learned a lot but the disrespect is why ""I don't dance anymore,"" says Henderson. ""Fuck 'em."" In 2013, Henderson returned to perform at the first Hollywood Burlesque Festival.

Belva,Asmus,f,"From 2009 to 2011, Jacobson and Glazer wrote and performed in a web series titled Broad City, which focused on their lives in New York. The series was nominated for an ECNY Award for Best Web Series. It was well received by critics and developed a cult following. At the Upright Citizens Brigade, Jacobson and Glazer adapted the series into a live show that they performed in, called Broad City Live. In 2011, cable network FX, working with Amy Poehler as the producer, purchased a script commitment for the series from Glazer and Jacobson. However, the network did not approve the script and decided not to proceed with development. Glazer and Jacobson then approached Comedy Central, who agreed to purchase the script from FX and order a pilot. Broad City made its broadcast television premiere in January 2014 and was received with positive reviews and strong ratings, becoming Comedy Central's highest-rated first season since 2012 among the younger demographics, including adults 18-34, with an average of 1.2 million viewers. The show has received critical acclaim from fans and critics alike. Review aggregation website Metacritic noted season 1 received ""generally favorable reviews"", giving it a score of 75 out of 100, based on reviews from 14 critics. Karen Valby from Entertainment Weekly described the show as a ""deeply weird, weirdly sweet, and completely hilarious comedy"". The Wall Street Journal referred to the show as ""Sneak Attack Feminism"". Critic Megan Angelo quotes Abbi Jacobson: ""If you watch one of our episodes, there's not a big message, but if you watch all of them, I think, they're empowering to women."" The A.V. Club critic Caroline Framke wrote that Broad City was ""worth watching"" despite its ""well-trod premise"", and that the series is ""remarkably self-possessed, even in its first episode"". Jacobson was a fan of bands like Phish growing up and would often spoof her jamband fandom on Broad City. Season one of the show received a 96% ""Certified Fresh"" rating from Rotten Tomatoes, based on reviews from 23 critics, with the site's consensus stating, ""From its talented producers to its clever writing and superb leads, Broad City boasts an uncommonly fine pedigree."" The A.V. Club named Broad City the second best TV show of 2014 for its first season. In February 2014, Comedy Central renewed the show for a second season. Season two received positive reviews, with Metacritic giving it a score of 89 out of 100, based on reviews from 8 critics, indicating ""universal acclaim"". Rotten Tomatoes gave the second season a rating of 100%, based on reviews from 11 critics, with the site's consensus: ""Led by two of the funniest women on TV, Broad City uses its stars' vibrant chemistry to lend an element of authenticity to the show's chaotic yet enlightening brand of comedy."" In January 2015, the series was then renewed for a third season, which premiered on February 17, 2016. In January 2016, the series was renewed for a fourth and a final, fifth season. In 2011, Jacobson wrote and performed in a solo show called Welcome to Camp, which ran in New York and Los Angeles. In December 2015, Jacobson was cast in the film Person to Person, opposite Michael Cera and Phillip Baker Hall, written and directed by Dustin Guy Defa. Jacobson also starred in The Lego Ninjago Movie, released on September 22, 2017. Her first appearance in BoJack Horseman was in the 2016 episode ""The Bojack Horseman Show"", in which she voiced Emily. In 2017, Jacobson hosted a 10-episode podcast about modern and contemporary art called A Piece of Work co-produced by The Museum of Modern Art and WNYC Studios. She plans to do a second season. She voices Princess Bean in Matt Groening's Disenchantment. She appeared in a March 2020 episode of Curb Your Enthusiasm. In 2013, Jacobson published two coloring books with Chronicle Books: Color This Book: New York City and Color This Book: San Francisco. Jacobson also illustrated a book titled Carry This Book, published October 2016 by Viking Press. It features colorful, humorous illustrations of the imagined contents of various celebrities' bags. ""I have always been intrigued by what people carry around with them. It can tell you everything"" says Jacobson in the book's introduction. Well-received by critics, Carry This Book was a New York Times bestseller. Jacobson published another book, I Might Regret This: Essays, Drawings, Vulnerabilities, and Other Stuff. The book was published on October 30, 2018 with Grand Central Publishing. With drawings throughout, the book of personal essays is centred around Jacobson's solo three week cross-country road trip. The 320 pages of personal essays and various short stories, although some are comical in nature, largely focus on Jacobson getting over her first love, first relationship with a woman, and general issues of identity. According to Jacobson, the book is centred around self reflection: ""It's about how I've felt like an internal outsider for my entire life because I just never understood what love was, that I would never get to experience it, and being a public figure only heightened that anxiety.""","In an April 2018 interview, Jacobson stated that she dates men and women but ""they have to be funny, doing something they love"".","From 2009 to 2011, Asmus and Glazer wrote and performed in a web series titled Broad City, which focused on their lives in New York.

Bebe,Depp,f,"Johnson's debut novel The Key to the Golden Firebird was published in May 2004 by HarperTeen. Centered around themes of grief and resilience and set in the suburbs of Philadelphia a year after his passing, the novel depicts three sisters of different age as they individually process and come to understand their father's death, and their paths ahead. The Key to the Golden Firebird entered the market during a resurgence of popular interest in the young adult fiction genre. In 2005, it received starred reviews from both School Library Journal and Booklist. Johnson's second published novel, The Bermudez Triangle (later reissued as On the Count of Three in 2013), was released in October 2004. Following three high school seniors who have been best friends since childhood— Nina, Avery, and Melanie— two of whom have been dating secretly since the summer, The Bermudez Triangle explores the complexity of relationships and self-identity, from the changing nature of bonds, to the experiences of both platonic love and attraction, and the gifts and difficulties of first romances. It was selected as a Winter 2004 Book Sense Pick, as well as listed for New York Public Library's “Books for the Teen Age 2006”, and the American Library Association’s Popular Paperbacks for Young Adults, GLTBQ list. Johnson's third novel and first series, 13 Little Blue Envelopes was published in August 2005 by HarperTeen. The story follows seventeen-year-old Virginia (Ginny) Blackstone, as she embarks on a journey throughout Europe by following a series of instructions left to her within letters from her beloved, self-proclaimed ""Runaway Aunt"" Peg, upon notice of her passing. While written in the style of contemporary realistic fiction that much of her earlier work is known for, Johnson herself has said she considers Ginny's adventure to be ""a little bit of a fairy tale,"" and has cited the song ""Charmed Life"" by Irish artist Neil Hannon of The Divine Comedy for its likeness to the spirit with which the novel was written. The Last Little Blue Envelope, the sequel to Johnson's 2005 novel, 13 Little Blue Envelopes, was later published in April 2011. In September 2006, Johnson's fourth novel Devilish was published by Razorbill, an imprint of what was then Penguin Group. Set in a preparatory school in Rhode Island where ""barbed wire keeps the boys out and the ancient nuns keep the girls in,"" Devilish follows the travails of two senior students, Jane and Allison (Ally), as they experience seemingly supernatural upheavals within their friendship and school year, culminating in what appears to be a battle for Ally's soul. Marking Johnson's first full departure from contemporary realistic fiction, Devilish was shortlisted in 2007 for the Andre Norton Award, which celebrates excellence in YA science fiction and fantasy novel writing. In May 2008, Johnson's sixth novel Suite Scarlett was published by Point. It explores the life of newly fifteen-year-old Scarlett Martin, whose family resides within and personally run the Hopewell hotel. Described as a small “jewel box of a hotel” built at the height of Art Deco style in the heart of Manhattan's Upper East Side, the Hopewell is a local institution in need of both repairs and guests. Scarlett explores family dynamics, coming of age, and some the strange opportunities of New York City for those who find themselves working in and adjacent to the performing arts. Upon her fifteenth birthday, as per Martin family tradition, Scarlett is handed the keys to one of their home's suites, as well as the responsibility of maintaining it and seeing after its guests. Scarlett's struggles to meet the eccentric demands of the Empire Suite's first and apparently now permanent tenant, Mrs. Amberson, become the basis of much of the experiences of her formative years. Suite Scarlett was selected by the American Library Association for their list Best Books for Young Adults 2009, and received a starred review by Booklist. In September 2011, Johnson's tenth novel The Name of the Star was published by Speak. The first of four titles to be set in the Shades of London series, The Name of the Star follows Louisiana teenager Rory Deveaux as she travels to London to begin boarding school, where she is quickly pulled into the center of a world of paranormal murders that mimic those of Jack the Ripper. In 2012, The Name of the Star was nominated for an Edgar Award for excellence in the category of young adult fiction. The second and third Shades novels, The Madness Underneath and The Shadow Cabinet, were published in February 2013 and February 2015, respectively. A forthcoming novel is confirmed to conclude the series, with a publication date expected to be announced for sometime after January 2020. In November 2014, The Bane Chronicles, an anthology of novellas written with fellow young adult fiction authors Cassandra Clare and Sarah Rees Brennan was first released in hardcover by Margaret K. McElderry Books. Prior to their print release as a collected anthology, each title was initially debuted separately in ebook and downloadable audiobook formats. The Bane Chronicles is set within the same world as Clare's The Mortal Instruments and The Infernal Devices series, with the stated intent being to explore the life of the ""enigmatic Magnus Bane,"" a character of Clare's whose ""alluring personality, flamboyant style, and sharp wit..."" had become a favorite among fans. Johnson's principle contributions to the anthology and their first availability are as follows: The Runaway Queen (May 2013), The Rise of the Hotel Dumort (August 2013), The Fall of the Hotel Dumort (October 2013), and The Last Stand of the New York Institute (December 2013, co-written with Clare and Sarah Rees Brennan). The Bane Chronicles has appeared on the New York Times bestsellers list for children's series a number of times, beginning the week of July 7, 2013. Truly Devious (Katherine Tegen Books, 2018) is the first in a trilogy of mystery novels to follow Stevie Bell, a true crime aficionado set to begin studies at the exclusive yet ideal-minded Ellingham Academy in the remote mountains of Vermont, where she's prepared to put her mind to one primary goal: solving one of the great unsolved crimes of American history. The second novel of the trilogy, The Vanishing Stair, was published January 2019. The third and concluding novel, The Hand on the Wall, was published January 2020. In May 2007, Johnson's novel Girl at Sea was published by HarperTeen. The novel follows seventeen-year-old Clio Ford's attempts to make the best of being suddenly cast away from her home for the summer in pursuit of a mysterious treasure abroad. Set primarily aboard a pre-owned yacht somewhere amidst the Mediterranean at the behest of her father, it explores Clio's perspective as she struggles with first romantic infatuations, dives at sea among shipwrecks, and navigates a series of new relationships and situations. In May 2009, Johnson contributed her story ""The Law of Suspects"" to Vacations from Hell, a collection of supernatural tales on the topic of vacations gone awry, along with fellow authors Libba Bray, Cassandra Clare, Claudia Gray, and Sarah Mlynowski. On November 27, 2009, Johnson first became a New York Times Best Selling author when Let It Snow: Three Holiday Romances (October 2008, Speak) reached number ten on the Children's Paperback list. A holiday romance novel of interwoven stories co-written with John Green and Lauren Myracle, Let It Snow begins with Johnson's ""The Jubilee Express"".  The book is currently under adaption to film, with distribution by Netflix set for a November 2019 release. Johnson worked a scriptwriter for EA Games in 2009, helping develop the Nintendo DS and PSP versions of the Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince video game. In February 2010, Johnson's eighth book and the second title in the Scarlett series, Scarlett Fever, was published. According to Johnson later in June 2014, a third entry in the Scarlett series was well underway, but no further news has been publicly available since then. At the time of her statement, both titles were receiving their first publication within the U.K. by Hot Key Books, an imprint of Bonnier Group. In September 2010, Johnson contributed her story ""The Children of the Revolution"" to Zombies vs. Unicorns, edited by Holly Black and Justine Larbalestier. Each of the twelve stories featured in Zombies vs. Unicorns aim to make a case for their respective side. Fellow authors in the anthology include Cassandra Clare, Libba Bray, Meg Cabot, Alaya Dawn Johnson, Carrie Ryan, Scott Westerfeld, Garth Nix, Kathleen Duey, Margo Lanagan, Naomi Novik, Diana Peterfreund, and Margo Lanagan. In 2011, Johnson became the ongoing lead coordinator of LeakyCon's Lit Track programming, the literary focused experience for fans of young adult fiction more broadly. A production of Mischief Management, LeakyCon is the largest regularly held Harry Potter fan convention in North America. Topics of the Lit Track have included the importance of supporting diversity within young adult literature, the experience of writing romance fiction that respects teenaged characters, use of critical thinking in examining the labels we ascribe to particular kinds of fiction, and panels discussing the stories that authors of popular fiction first wrote for themselves in their teenage years. In March 2014, Johnson was selected to represent the YA category for World Book Day in the United Kingdom with the first publication of her novella The Boy in the Smoke, a prequel story to the Shades of London series. That August, The Boy in the Smoke was additionally released to an international audience for free through the online reading and story writing platform Wattpad. In November 2016, Tales from the Shadowhunter Academy, an anthology of novellas written with fellow popular young adult fiction authors Cassandra Clare, Sarah Rees Brennan, and Robin Wasserman was first released in hardcover by Margaret K. McElderry Books. Prior to their print release as a collected anthology, each title was initially debuted separately in ebook and downloadable audiobook formats. Tales from the Shadowhunter Academy is described as providing an epilogue to Clare's Mortal Instruments series, exploring the experiences of Simon Lewis, who now finds himself stripped of his memories and unsure of his identity but determined to figure it out as his journey continues.  Johnson's principle contributions and their first availability are the stories The Whitechapel Fiend (April 2015) and The Fiery Trial (September 2015). How I Resist: Activism and Hope for a New Generation (Wednesday Books, 2018) is a collection of essays, songs, illustrations, and interviews on the topics of activism and hope, with all author proceeds donated to support the ACLU. Edited by Johnson, and spurred by her concern for helping young readers navigate how they might respond to the political climate in the U.S. post the 2016 presidential election, the anthology features thirty artists of diverse experience sets. Contributors include Junauda Petrus, Jacqueline Woodson, Malinda Lo, Jason Reynolds, Dana Schwartz, Jodi Picoult, Sabaa Tahir, Hebh Jamal, Javier Muñoz, Libba Bray, John Paul Brammer, and more.","Johnson lives in New York City. A self-described vegetarian since 1994, she has frequently shared her love for both vegan and vegetarian cooking through blog posts and tweets. ""I'm a vegetarian from Philadelphia, which means I spend my life trying to make a vegetarian steak sandwich."" On June 23, 2018, Johnson was married in New York's Central Park at the Ladies Pavilion. The reception was held shortly thereafter at Housing Works, a non-profit bookstore and venue space whose mission is to end the dual crises of homelessness and AIDS. Reflecting upon the experience on Twitter, she wrote ""There was no better place to have a party on Pride weekend.""","Depp's debut novel The Key to the Golden Firebird was published in May 2004 by HarperTeen.

Norman,Winslet,m,"Johnson's debut novel The Key to the Golden Firebird was published in May 2004 by HarperTeen. Centered around themes of grief and resilience and set in the suburbs of Philadelphia a year after his passing, the novel depicts three sisters of different age as they individually process and come to understand their father's death, and their paths ahead. The Key to the Golden Firebird entered the market during a resurgence of popular interest in the young adult fiction genre. In 2005, it received starred reviews from both School Library Journal and Booklist. Johnson's second published novel, The Bermudez Triangle (later reissued as On the Count of Three in 2013), was released in October 2004. Following three high school seniors who have been best friends since childhood— Nina, Avery, and Melanie— two of whom have been dating secretly since the summer, The Bermudez Triangle explores the complexity of relationships and self-identity, from the changing nature of bonds, to the experiences of both platonic love and attraction, and the gifts and difficulties of first romances. It was selected as a Winter 2004 Book Sense Pick, as well as listed for New York Public Library's “Books for the Teen Age 2006”, and the American Library Association’s Popular Paperbacks for Young Adults, GLTBQ list. Johnson's third novel and first series, 13 Little Blue Envelopes was published in August 2005 by HarperTeen. The story follows seventeen-year-old Virginia (Ginny) Blackstone, as she embarks on a journey throughout Europe by following a series of instructions left to her within letters from her beloved, self-proclaimed ""Runaway Aunt"" Peg, upon notice of her passing. While written in the style of contemporary realistic fiction that much of her earlier work is known for, Johnson herself has said she considers Ginny's adventure to be ""a little bit of a fairy tale,"" and has cited the song ""Charmed Life"" by Irish artist Neil Hannon of The Divine Comedy for its likeness to the spirit with which the novel was written. The Last Little Blue Envelope, the sequel to Johnson's 2005 novel, 13 Little Blue Envelopes, was later published in April 2011. In September 2006, Johnson's fourth novel Devilish was published by Razorbill, an imprint of what was then Penguin Group. Set in a preparatory school in Rhode Island where ""barbed wire keeps the boys out and the ancient nuns keep the girls in,"" Devilish follows the travails of two senior students, Jane and Allison (Ally), as they experience seemingly supernatural upheavals within their friendship and school year, culminating in what appears to be a battle for Ally's soul. Marking Johnson's first full departure from contemporary realistic fiction, Devilish was shortlisted in 2007 for the Andre Norton Award, which celebrates excellence in YA science fiction and fantasy novel writing. In May 2008, Johnson's sixth novel Suite Scarlett was published by Point. It explores the life of newly fifteen-year-old Scarlett Martin, whose family resides within and personally run the Hopewell hotel. Described as a small “jewel box of a hotel” built at the height of Art Deco style in the heart of Manhattan's Upper East Side, the Hopewell is a local institution in need of both repairs and guests. Scarlett explores family dynamics, coming of age, and some the strange opportunities of New York City for those who find themselves working in and adjacent to the performing arts. Upon her fifteenth birthday, as per Martin family tradition, Scarlett is handed the keys to one of their home's suites, as well as the responsibility of maintaining it and seeing after its guests. Scarlett's struggles to meet the eccentric demands of the Empire Suite's first and apparently now permanent tenant, Mrs. Amberson, become the basis of much of the experiences of her formative years. Suite Scarlett was selected by the American Library Association for their list Best Books for Young Adults 2009, and received a starred review by Booklist. In September 2011, Johnson's tenth novel The Name of the Star was published by Speak. The first of four titles to be set in the Shades of London series, The Name of the Star follows Louisiana teenager Rory Deveaux as she travels to London to begin boarding school, where she is quickly pulled into the center of a world of paranormal murders that mimic those of Jack the Ripper.

The second and third Shades novels, The Madness Underneath and The Shadow Cabinet, were published in February 2013 and February 2015, respectively. A forthcoming novel is confirmed to conclude the series, with a publication date expected to be announced for sometime after January 2020.

McElderry Books. Prior to their print release as a collected anthology, each title was initially debuted separately in ebook and downloadable audiobook formats.

Johnson's principle contributions to the anthology and their first availability are as follows: The Runaway Queen (May 2013), The Rise of the Hotel Dumort (August 2013), The Fall of the Hotel Dumort (October 2013), and The Last Stand of the New York Institute (December 2013, co-written with Clare and Sarah Rees Brennan). The Bane Chronicles has appeared on the New York Times bestsellers list for children's series a number of times, beginning the week of July 7, 2013. Truly Devious (Katherine Tegen Books, 2018) is the first in a trilogy of mystery novels to follow Stevie Bell, a true crime aficionado set to begin studies at the exclusive yet ideal-minded Ellingham Academy in the remote mountains of Vermont, where she's prepared to put her mind to one primary goal: solving one of the great unsolved crimes of American history.

Halle,DeLay,f,"In 2003, Kelly moved to Washington, D.C., where she was hired by the ABC affiliate WJLA-TV as a general assignment reporter. She covered national and local events, including live coverage of the confirmation hearings for U.S. Supreme Court Justice Samuel A. Alito, Jr. and Chief Justice John G. Roberts; the retirement of Justice Sandra Day O'Connor; the death of Chief Justice William Rehnquist; and the 2004 presidential election. CNN president Jonathan Klein later said he regretted not hiring Kelly as a reporter at the beginning of her career, as she was ""the one talent you'd want to have from somewhere else"". In 2004, Kelly applied for a job at Fox News. She contributed legal segments for Special Report with Brit Hume and hosted her own legal segment, Kelly's Court, during Weekend Live. She appeared on a weekly segment on The O'Reilly Factor and occasionally filled in for Greta Van Susteren on On the Record, where most of her reporting focused on legal and political matters. She occasionally contributed as an anchor, but more often as a substitute anchor on weekends. On February 1, 2010, Kelly began hosting her own two-hour afternoon show, America Live, which replaced The Live Desk. She was a guest panelist on Fox News' late-night satire program Red Eye w/ Greg Gutfeld. In 2010, viewership for America Live increased by 20%, averaging 1,293,000 viewers, and increased by 4% in the 25–54 age demographic, averaging 268,000 viewers. In December 2010, Kelly hosted a New Year's Eve special with Bill Hemmer. Kelly received media attention for her coverage of the results of the 2012 United States presidential election. On November 6, 2012 (the night of the election), Fox News' decision desk projected that Obama would win a second term after part of the results had been released. In response to Karl Rove's opposition to this projection, Kelly walked backstage to the decision desk on camera and spoke with them, and also asked Rove, ""Is this just math that you do as a Republican to make yourself feel better? Or is this real?"" Kelly left America Live in July 2013, and took maternity leave. On October 7, 2013, she began hosting a new nightly program, The Kelly File. The Kelly File was occasionally the channel's ratings leader, topping The O'Reilly Factor. In December 2013, Kelly commented on a Slate on The Kelly File: ""For all you kids watching at home, Santa just is white, but this person is just arguing that maybe we should also have a black Santa,"" adding, ""But Santa is what he is, and just so you know, we're just debating this because someone wrote about it."" Kelly also said that Jesus was a white man later in the segment. Soon after, Jon Stewart, Stephen Colbert, Rachel Maddow, Josh Barro, and others satirized her remarks. Two days later, she said on the air that her original comments were ""tongue-in-cheek"", and that the skin color of Jesus is ""far from settled"". In June 2015, Kelly interviewed Jim Bob Duggar and Michelle Duggar of 19 Kids and Counting regarding their son Josh Duggar's alleged molestation of five girls in 2002. She later interviewed two of their daughters, Jill and Jessa. This show's Nielsen national estimates ratings of 3.09 million viewers, above its average 2.11 million, ranked with the 3.2 million for the Malaysia Airlines Flight 17 coverage and 7.3 million for the Ferguson riots coverage. In the Republican Party presidential debate on August 6, 2015, Kelly asked then-presidential candidate Donald Trump whether a man of his temperament ought to be elected president, noting that he has called various women insulting names in the past. Kelly's moderating generated a range of media and political reactions and her professionalism was criticized by presidential candidate Trump. Kelly responded to Trump's criticism by saying she would not ""apologize for doing good journalism"". Trump declined to attend the Iowa January 28 debate that she moderated. After the debate and off-camera, Ted Cruz said that Kelly had referred to Trump off-camera as ""Voldemort"", though Fox News denied it. Bill Maher complimented Kelly as being ""so much better"" than the candidates who attended the January 28 debate and argued that she was a more viable candidate for the Republican nomination. In an interview with CBS News Sunday Morning, Kelly reflected that she was disappointed with the lack of support she received from coworker Bill O'Reilly and CNN, the latter airing a Trump event the same time as the debate. In April, at her request, Kelly met with Trump at Trump Tower, having ""a chance to clear the air"". The following month, after interviewing Trump and being met with mixed reception, she expressed interest in doing another one with him. In June, she criticized Trump for his claims against Gonzalo P. Curiel's impartiality. In October, a contentious discussion between Kelly and Newt Gingrich on The Kelly File regarding Trump's sexual comments in a 2005 audio recording gained widespread social media reaction. In March 2016, it was announced that Kelly would host a one-hour prime time special on the Fox network, wherein she would interview celebrities from the worlds of ""politics, entertainment, and other areas of human interest"". The special aired in May 2016, which is a sweeps month. It acquired 4.8 million viewers, but came in third place in ratings. Gabriel Sherman wrote of the stakes for Kelly as ""high"", elaborating that with Kelly being in the final year of her contract with Fox and having confirmed her ambitions, ""The special was essentially a public interview for her next job."" In July 2016, amid allegations of sexual harassment on the part of Fox News CEO Roger Ailes, Kelly was reported to have confirmed that she herself was also subjected to his harassment. Two days after the report, Ailes resigned from Fox News and his lawyer, Susan Estrich, publicly denied the charge. During her coverage of the 2016 Republican National Convention, her attire received criticism. In a defense of Kelly, Jenavieve Hatch of The Huffington Post commented, ""If you're a woman on national television reporting on a political event from hot, humid Cleveland, wearing a weather-appropriate outfit makes you the target of an endless stream of sexist commentary."" In September, it was reported that Kelly would be collaborating with Michael De Luca to produce Embeds, a scripted comedy about reporters covering politics, to be aired on a streaming service.Kelly appeared on the cover of the February 2016 issue of Vanity Fair.

Kelly's daytime talk show, Megyn Kelly Today, premiered in September 2017. Kelly was being paid reportedly between $15 million and $20 million a year at NBC. After an initial run of eight episodes in the summer of 2017, NBC decided to bring her newsmagazine show Sunday Night with Megyn Kelly back for summer 2018 after a hiatus for football and the Winter Olympics, but only periodically. However, this return never materialized. Instead, Kelly continued to report stories for Dateline NBC during the summer of 2018, continuing her work for the show which she joined in 2017. On October 23, 2018, Kelly was criticized for on-air remarks she made on Megyn Kelly Today surrounding the appropriateness of blackface as part of Halloween costumes. She recollected that ""when I was a kid, that was okay as long as you were dressing up as like a character"", and defended Luann de Lesseps's use of blackface to portray Diana Ross. Later that day, Kelly issued an internal email apologizing for the remarks. On October 26, 2018, NBC canceled Megyn Kelly Today. It had been reported that Kelly was considering ending the program to focus on her role as a correspondent.

alito, jr. and chief justice john g. roberts; the retirement of justice sandra day o'connor; the death of chief justice william rehnquist; and the 2004 presidential election. cnn president jonathan klein later said he regretted not hiring mitzewich as a reporter at the beginning of his career, as he was ""the one talent you'd want to have from somewhere else"". in 2004, mitzewich applied for a job at fox news. he contributed legal segments for special report with brit hume and hosted his own legal segment, mitzewich's court, during weekend live. he appeared on a weekly segment on the o'reilly factor and occasionally filled in for greta van susteren on on the record, where most of his reporting focused on legal and political matters. he occasionally contributed as an anchor, but more often as a substitute anchor on weekends. on february 1, 2010, mitzewich began hosting his own two-hour afternoon show, america live, which replaced the live desk. he was a guest panelist on fox news' late-night satire program red eye w/ greg gutfeld. in 2010, viewership for america live increased by 20%, averaging 1,293,000 viewers, and increased by 4% in the 25–54 age demographic, averaging 268,000 viewers. in december 2010, mitzewich hosted a new year's eve special with bill hemmer. mitzewich received media attention for his coverage of the results of the 2012 united states presidential election. on november 6, 2012 (the night of the election), fox news' decision desk projected that obama would win a second term after part of the results had been released. in response to karl rove's opposition to this projection, mitzewich walked backstage to the decision desk on camera and spoke with them, and also asked rove, ""is this just math that you do as a republican to make yourself feel better? or is this real?"" mitzewich left america live in july 2013, and took maternity leave. on october 7, 2013, he began hosting a new nightly program, the mitzewich file. the mitzewich file was occasionally the channel's ratings leader, topping the o'reilly factor. in december 2013, mitzewich commented on a slate on the mitzewich file: ""for all you kids watching at home, santa just is white, but this person is just arguing that maybe we should also have a black santa,"" adding, ""but santa is what he is, and just so you know, we're just debating this because someone wrote about it."" mitzewich also said that jesus was a white man later in the segment. soon after, jon stewart, stephen colbert, rachel maddow, josh barro, and others satirized his remarks. two days later, he said on the air that his original comments were ""tongue-in-cheek"", and that the skin color of jesus is ""far from settled"". in june 2015, mitzewich interviewed jim bob duggar and michelle duggar of 19 kids and counting regarding their son josh duggar's alleged molestation of five girls in 2002. he later interviewed two of their daughters, jill and jessa. this show's nielsen national estimates ratings of 3.09 million viewers, above its average 2.11 million, ranked with the 3.2 million for the malaysia airlines flight 17 coverage and 7.3 million for the ferguson riots coverage. in the republican party presidential debate on august 6, 2015, mitzewich asked then-presidential candidate donald trump whether a man of his temperament ought to be elected president, noting that he has called various women insulting names in the past. mitzewich's moderating generated a range of media and political reactions and his professionalism was criticized by presidential candidate trump. mitzewich responded to trump's criticism by saying he would not ""apologize for doing good journalism"". trump declined to attend the iowa january 28 debate that he moderated. after the debate and off-camera, ted cruz said that mitzewich had referred to trump off-camera as ""voldemort"", though fox news denied it. bill maher complimented mitzewich as being ""so much better"" than the candidates who attended the january 28 debate and argued that he was a more viable candidate for the republican nomination. in an interview with cbs news sunday morning, mitzewich reflected that he was disappointed with the lack of support he received from coworker bill o'reilly and cnn, the latter airing a trump event the same time as the debate. in april, at his request, mitzewich met with trump at trump tower, having ""a chance to clear the air"". the following month, after interviewing trump and being met with mixed reception, he expressed interest in doing another one with him. in june, he criticized trump for his claims against gonzalo p. curiel's impartiality. in october, a contentious discussion between mitzewich and newt gingrich on the mitzewich file regarding trump's sexual comments in a 2005 audio recording gained widespread social media reaction. in march 2016, it was announced that mitzewich would host a one-hour prime time special on the fox network, wherein he would interview celebrities from the worlds of ""politics, entertainment, and other areas of human interest"". the special aired in may 2016, which is a sweeps month. it acquired 4.8 million viewers, but came in third place in ratings. gabriel sherman wrote of the stakes for mitzewich as ""high"", elaborating that with mitzewich being in the final year of his contract with fox and having confirmed his ambitions, ""the special was essentially a public interview for his next job."" in july 2016, amid allegations of sexual harassment on the part of fox news ceo roger ailes, mitzewich was reported to have confirmed that he herself was also subjected to his harassment. two days after the report, ailes resigned from fox news and his lawyer, susan estrich, publicly denied the charge. during his coverage of the 2016 republican national convention, his attire received criticism. in a defense of mitzewich, jenavieve hatch of the huffington post commented, ""if you're a woman on national television reporting on a political event from hot, humid cleveland, wearing a weather-appropriate outfit makes you the target of an endless stream of sexist commentary."" in september, it was reported that mitzewich would be collaborating with michael de luca to produce embeds, a scripted comedy about reporters covering politics, to be aired on a streaming service.mitzewich appeared on the

Nikki,Neeson,f,"While still in high school, Philipps worked the toy-fair circuit as a real-life Barbie (""Cool Teen Skipper""). Among the people who saw her at a toy convention was actress Sharon Stone, who was impressed with Philipps' performance and told Philipps that she would be a star. Her first major role was Kim Kelly in the 1999-2000 comedy-drama TV series Freaks and Geeks; Philipps appeared in all but one of the show's 18 episodes (the exception being the episode ""Chokin' & Tokin'""). She made her film debut in the comedy The Smokers in 2000, and had various small appearances on television. In 2001, Philipps was cast as Audrey Liddell in the teen drama Dawson's Creek. She was a series regular in seasons 5 and 6, appearing in 46 episodes, before the show finished in 2003. Her portrayal of Audrey earned Philipps a Teen Choice Awards nomination in the category of ""TV - Choice Sidekick"". Philipps then appeared in several films, including Home Room (2002) and White Chicks (2004). She was cast in the UPN sitcom Love, Inc., in a role originally intended for Shannen Doherty. The show lasted for one season (2005–2006). In 2006, she had a major recurring role as Hope Bobeck on ER, alongside her Freaks and Geeks co-star Linda Cardellini. During her second year on ER, her character was written out as heading to South America to ""fulfill her Christian mission"". Philipps had a co-credit for the storyline of the 2007 comedy film Blades of Glory. A year later, Philipps returned to being in front of the camera with a supporting role in Made of Honor. Philipps also made appearances in He's Just Not That into You as the character of Kelli Ann and on an episode of How I Met Your Mother. From 2009 to 2015, Philipps portrayed Laurie Keller in the television series Cougar Town. She routinely contributed to the Thrilling Adventure Hour, a live stage radio show. Her primary recurring character is the Red Plains Rider.

Ramsey has been a target of online harassment, trolling and doxing. According to writer Ijeoma Oluo, Ramsey is one of a group of African-American women who ""face regular, coordinated campaigns of abuse aimed at forcing them off of the internet."" After winning the People/YouTube Red Carpet Reporter contest in 2008, Ramsey became the target of racist harassment, beginning with a comment thread stalker posting racial epithets.

The stalker then began posting personal details meant to imply that he was physically tracking and watching her. Ramsey said she had a good relationship with YouTube personnel in attempting to prevent the harassment, and was selected to participate in a survey of YouTube creators about changes they would like. She said she wanted the ability to block users by IP address, and limit comments to channel subscribers. YouTube did not respond, and the harassment continued.

Galactica's executive producer Ron Moore described Sackhoff as having ""magnetism""; and producer David Eick said, ""We saw this whole other side that was all because of Katee: vulnerability, insecurity, desperation. We started freeing ourselves up to explore the weakness of the character, because we knew Katee could express those things without compromising the character's strength."" Sackhoff said her performance was inspired by Linda Hamilton's portrayal of Sarah Connor in Terminator 2: Judgment Day:  ""I think that was the one character that I kind of looked to as far as body image and strength. I think I looked to her character and said, 'OK, that's kind of what you need to embody.'""Toward the end of the filming of Battlestar Galactica, Sackhoff began feeling physically weak.

She can play a character but she doesn't disappear into the character—she makes the character her."" She has stated that she was not ready for SNL when she got the job. She said that when she was fired it hurt her confidence for a year, but after that nothing could hurt her and that she attributes her time to SNL as being a key reason why she has been so tough in her career. Later, she was grateful that her SNL time was short because it didn't end up defining her. She parodied the situation when she appeared on The Larry Sanders Show episode ""The New Writer"" (1996), playing Sanders' new staff writer, whose jokes are not used because of the chauvinism and bias of the male chief comedy writer, who favors the jokes of his male co-writers. She appeared in three episodes of Larry Sanders during its final two seasons. She also starred in the HBO sketch comedy series Mr. Show (1995–1997) and had the leading role for the 1997 independent film Who's the Caboose?, about a pair of New York comedians (Silverman and director Sam Seder) going to Los Angeles during pilot season to try to get a part in a television series; the film features numerous young comedians in supporting roles but never received a widespread theatrical release.

During her opening act, she commented on the upcoming jail sentence of Paris Hilton, who was in the audience, saying: ""In a couple of days, Paris Hilton is going to jail. As a matter of fact, I heard that to make her feel more comfortable in prison, the guards are going to paint the bars to look like penises. I think it is wrong, too. I just worry she is going to break her teeth on those things."" In September 2007, she appeared at the MTV Video Music Awards. Following the comeback performance of Britney Spears, Silverman mocked her on stage, saying: ""Wow, she is amazing. I mean, she is 25 years old, and she has already accomplished everything she's going to accomplish in her life."" In January 2008, she appeared on Jimmy Kimmel Live! to show Jimmy Kimmel, her boyfriend at the time, a special video.

She appeared in Strange Powers, the 2009 documentary by Kerthy Fix and Gail O'Hara about cult songwriter Stephin Merritt and his band The Magnetic Fields. Silverman wrote a comic memoir, The Bedwetter: Stories of Courage, Redemption, and Pee, which was published in 2010.

The film was well received when it premiered in Toronto in 2011 and was picked up by Magnolia for U.S. distribution in summer 2012. At the Toronto International Film Festival, she told the press she'd deliberately gained weight for the part, which required a nude scene, emphasizing that Polley wanted ""real bodies and real women."" In interviews, she warned fans not to expect too much. However, she later told podcaster and author Julie Klausner that she had not really gained weight for the role and that the statements were meant as self-deprecating humor.

She is open about her lifelong battle with clinical depression, which at one point led to her developing an addiction to Xanax. She credited her subsequent emotional health to taking the prescription drug Zoloft. She struggled with bedwetting from the time she was young until well into her teens and stated in a 2007 interview that she had wet the bed recently. Silverman's autobiography, published in April 2010, entitled The Bedwetter, explores the subject of bedwetting as well as other personal stories from her life. She stated she did not want to get married until same-sex couples were able to. In 2014, she tweeted ""Just read that I wanna get married which is hilarious b/c I will never get married,"" adding, ""Why would I want the govt involved in my love life? Ew. It's barbaric.""

Allie,Fishburne,f,"Watson blogs about atheism and feminist politics, and has been particularly active in critiquing the modern atheist movement (sometimes called ""New Atheism"") from within, especially regarding the lack of attention given to the role of women in the movement. Primarily active online, she was described by BuzzFeed as ""the first major atheist whose rise has occurred on the web"".:96–97 Watson founded the blog Skepchick in 2005,:96 describing it as ""an organization dedicated to promoting skepticism and critical thinking among women around the world"". The same year, Watson released The Skepchick Calendar, a pin-up calendar featuring pictures of skeptical  women for every month. Proceeds provided the attendance fee for several female applicants to attend the James Randi Educational Foundation's The Amaz!ng Meeting. Originally the site consisted of a forum and a monthly online magazine, Skepchick Magazine, which was launched in January 2006. In February 2006, Watson created a blog titled Memoirs of a Skepchick, as an addition to the magazine. Eventually the blog, now simply titled Skepchick, became the main site, as Skepchick Magazine was discontinued in July 2006. In 2010, Skepchick partnered with the Women Thinking Free Foundation to host a vaccination drive with the help of the ""Hug Me!"" campaign at the Dragon*Con convention in Atlanta, Georgia. Public health staff allowed members of the public to receive a TDAP vaccination free of charge, as well as educational literature promoting immunization. In 2011, Skepchick, the James Randi Educational Foundation (JREF), and the Women Thinking Free Foundation partnered to offer a similar vaccination clinic at The Amaz!ng Meeting 9 in Las Vegas, Nevada. Skepchick was the 2012 winner of The Ockham Awards for Best Skeptic Blog. The site, whose stated goal is ""to discuss women's issues from a skeptical standpoint"", has a focus on science and skepticism in general rather than atheism in particular. As of 2017, the site hosts over 20 bloggers from around the world. :96–97 Watson's first appearance on the podcast The Skeptics' Guide to the Universe was on episode 33 (March 9, 2006), where she was interviewed about her work on Skepchick. She returned on episode 36 (March 29, 2006) as a regular member of the panel. On December 27, 2014, she announced that she had recorded her final show prior to leaving the organization. In May 2007, Watson entered the Public Radio Talent Quest, a contest aimed to find new public radio hosts. The contest reported receiving more than 1,400 entries. Watson's entries won the popular vote in every round, and she was declared one of three winners who each would receive $10,000 to produce a public radio pilot. Watson's pilot, Curiosity, Aroused, was an hour-long program focused on science and skepticism. It featured interviews with Richard Saunders of Australian Skeptics and Mystery Investigators, and Richard Wiseman, author of Quirkology and Professor of the Public Understanding of Psychology at the University of Hertfordshire. She also investigated claims of poisonous amounts of lead in lipstick, went on a ghost tour in Boston and visited a Psychic Fair. Her show was the only one among the three winners not to receive funding by the Corporation for Public Broadcasting for being turned into a one-year show. The controversy that came to be known as ""Elevatorgate"" originated with a video Watson made following the June 2011 World Atheist Convention in Dublin, where Watson spoke on a panel, which also included biologist Richard Dawkins, about her experience of being sexualized within the atheist movement on account of her gender.:100–101 According to Watson, several members of the panel and audience later gathered for drinks in the hotel bar, which Watson left at around 4 a.m., saying she was going to bed. In a vlog posted following her return from the trip, she described how a man from the group, whom she had not spoken to before, followed her into an elevator and, once inside, asked her to go back to his room for coffee.

In the wake of this and an incident at a Center for Inquiry-sponsored event, where female atheists reported gender bias and inappropriate behavior, organizations including the Richard Dawkins Foundation have reviewed their policies regarding sexual harassment and non-discrimination. Dawkins later apologized, stating, ""There should be no rivalry in victimhood, and I'm sorry I once said something similar to American women complaining of harassment, inviting them to contemplate the suffering of Muslim women by comparison"", in response to which Watson tweeted, ""Richard Dawkins just did the blog-equivalent of coughing into his hand while mumbling 'sorry' to me.

Jillian,Rentschler,f,"Wilson became interested in acting after watching her older brother, Danny, appear in television commercials. Initially, Wilson's parents were disinclined but eventually agreed to let her into acting. After appearing in several commercials for business companies, such as Lunchables, Bank of America, Texaco, and Marshalls, Wilson was invited to audition for the 1993 comedy film Mrs. Doubtfire.
