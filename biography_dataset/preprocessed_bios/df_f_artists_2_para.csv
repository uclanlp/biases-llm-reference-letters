Sasha,Boyd,f,"Between 1916 and 1951, Bernstein would do set design, costuming, or both for 51 productions. Bernstein was a theater set and costume designer for the Neighborhood Playhouse on the Lower East Side, volunteering her work to make her name. In 1926 she struggled but prevailed in becoming the first female member of the designers union. This membership opened up opportunities for Broadway commissions. However, as a woman, she still found that it was much easier to find work as a costume designer rather than as a set designer. Her career ran in phases; early on, she focused largely on costume design. After about 14 years of work, in 1930, she was able to move into set design. For about a decade, she primarily did set design work, only to return to costume design again around 1940 for the final phase of her career. In the 1930s she also began to write, with two books published by Knopf, a highly respected publisher at that time. She was personal friends with Arthur and Blanche Knopf. Her first book, Three Blue Suits, helped to more firmly establish her as a designer in New York. The book included a series of three stories in which three very different men wear the same blue serge suit. The details regarding how each man wears – or drags (the jacket on the floor) – his suit, reveal aspects of each man's character in subtle ways. A common trope among costume designer is that costumes, if they are good, should ultimately not be noticed. In contrast, the blue suit stories reveal Bernstein's ability to discern how critical details of costume evoke, and interact with, a character, and ultimately her skill as a costume designer at making this happen effectively. Some of her publications include: In 1950, Aline Bernstein finally won some hard earned recognition. In 1949 she had designed costumes for the opera Regina. The music and libretto were written Marc Blitzstein but based on the play The Little Foxes by Lillian Hellman, a play for which Bernstein had previously designed costumes. Although that production of Regina (it would be regularly revived in the 20th century) only ran for a month and a half, Bernstein won a Tony for her costume design in 1950.","Aline married Theodore F. Bernstein, a Wall Street broker, on November 19, 1902. Bernstein and her husband had two children: Theodore Frankau Bernstein (1904–1949), and Edla Cusick (1906–1983).  Her marriage remained intact throughout and despite her affair with Thomas Wolfe. Bernstein died on September 7, 1955, in New York City, aged 74. Bernstein met Thomas Wolfe in 1925 aboard the RMS Olympic when Wolfe was 25 and Bernstein 44. Bernstein became Wolfe's lover and provided Wolfe with emotional, domestic, and financial support while he wrote his first novel, Look Homeward, Angel, which he dedicated to Bernstein. Wolfe immortalized Bernstein as the character Esther Jack in his novels Of Time and the River, The Web and the Rock, You Can't Go Home Again, and The Good Child's River. Bernstein, in turn, centered her autobiographical novel The Journey Down around her affair with Wolfe. Bernstein's and Wolfe's affair ended after a few years, but their friendship continued.

Wilma,Kokesh,f,"In 1927 Bry showed portraits and abstractions that she called ""imaginative creations"" in a solo exhibition at a gallery in Corsicana, Texas. The portraits showed George Gershwin, Rebecca West, Irwin Edman, and other well-known people. She told a reporter that by expressing her feelings the abstractions helped her to overcome depression and ""turbulent moods."" A year later the New York Post included her portrait of Carl Van Doren in its Saturday Gravure section and two of her drawings were included in a show organized by the Opportunity Gallery. Over the next few years her work appeared in group shows at the same gallery and in the gallery of a printer of limited edition books. In 1932 she exhibited with two other women in the G.R.D. Gallery. The still lifes in that show drew comment from a critic for the New York Times who praised her ""knowing technique"" and appreciated her enigmatic titles. (""Atavic,"" for a still life of red cabbage, beets, and eggplant, was one.) She joined the National Association of Women Painters and Sculptors in 1934 and contributed paintings to some of its exhibitions, but she did not take an active role in that organization. When she showed line drawings in a 1935 exhibition at the National Association's Argent Galleries, a critic praised her skill, writing that her ""drawings might bid Picasso look to his laurels. In October 1935 she held a solo exhibition of oil paintings at a commercial gallery in St. Louis. A notice of the show in the St. Louis Star drew attention to her versatility. ""Her output,"" it said, ""is large, not only in oil, but in etching, lithography, wood carving, and sanguine crayon."" The following year she was given a solo exhibition at the Grant Gallery in which she showed still lifes, landscapes, and scenes showing indigenous Mexicans. In 1937 she showed a lithograph called ""Exiled"" in the International Print Makers Exhibition at the Los Angeles Museum. The Los Angeles Times headed its article on the show with a reproduction of the print and its critic said it was ""grim."" This 1936 lithograph and a 1937 painting she made of the same scene were later purchased by the Metropolitan Museum of Art. The lithograph can be seen at right.  Bry joined the nonprofit Studio Guild in 1937. During the next few years she participated in the Studio Guild's exhibitions. She also helped to arrange Guild-sponsored events that raised money for overseas relief work. In 1938, for example, she organized the sale of works donated by 130 artists for funds to support the work of the Joint Distribution Committee to help European Jews escape Nazi persecution. A year later she contributed works to a Guild exhibition that circulated among museums and galleries around the country. In 1940, when the Metropolitan Museum of Art put ""Exiled"" on view, a New York Sun reporter interviewed Bry. In the interview, she said she intended the painting to convey a sense of finality and doom. While she recognized that it was topical, she said there was nothing propagandistic in her intent. In 1941 Bry became active in an artists' advocacy group called the Federation of Modern Painters and Sculptors. She showed in its first and in subsequent annual exhibitions and participated in special exhibitions as well. Her contribution of a collage called ""Equations"" in the 35th annual exhibition of 1976 seems to have been her last. She served as recording secretary and vice-president of the organization and in 1945 was elected its president. Bry continued to participate in group exhibitions during the war years, but she also volunteered her time in war-related work. In 1942 she began art classes for wounded soldiers, a year later she made war bond posters and made skin-draft drawings for a plastic surgeon, and in 1945 she painted irises for artificial eyes. Before the war Bry had traveled to Guatemala which then became the source of much of her later work. Working from sketches she made then, she finished a lithograph called ""Palin"" in 1945 (seen at left). Showing Guatemalan Indians grouped around a Ceiba tree, the print was commissioned by a commercial gallery called Associated American Artists. In the post-war years she continued to show oils, watercolors, and prints in group exhibitions held by the associations of which she was a member and in 1951 was given a solo exhibition at the John Heller gallery. The latter drew critics' attention for what one called a shift in her work from ""visual sobriety"" to expressionistic feeling. Bry explained the transition as an effort to free herself from the ""tyranny of nature."" She aimed to move from painting subjects ""in the customary sense like a figure or scene"" toward a more direct expression of emotion. In these deeply felt works she increasingly showed religious subjects. In the late 1950s Bry began to experiment with works in fused glass and vitreous enamel and thereafter began to make fused glass panels mainly for places of worship. After her death in 1991 she was best known for these works of the 1960s and 1970s. In 1983 the Loeb Student Art Center at New York University gave her a retrospective exhibition. Bry was a versatile artist who painted in oils, drew using graphite and crayon, and produced watercolors, and pastels. She made lithographs, woodcuts, and etchings. She did wood carving, mosaics, and large works in glass employing fused glass and enamel. Although her style evolved considerably during her long career, she avoided non-objectivism. She deployed degrees of abstraction, beginning with social realism and proceeding to a nearly free-form abstract expressionism. The progression was not clear-cut, however. Early in her career she made what she called ""imaginative paintings"" and in mid-career she made paintings that were, she said, ""free harmonies of beautiful glowing colors."" Late in her career she was still producing realist work such as the watercolor, ""Fire Island 3,"" shown at right. For the most part her work could be described as semi-abstract. Its subjects were discernible, whether easily so, or only on close examination. She was seen as an expressive artist. A critic noted a tension between two styles of expressive work, one that revealed the ""discipline of an inner reticence"" and another consisting of a ""more dynamic emotional expressionism."" Critics saw this expressive content in both her realist and the more abstract paintings. Her collage, ""Moonlit Ocean Seascape,"" at left, shows her late abstract style. She was noted for her skill in composition and handling of color. In 1932 a critic praised three still life paintings for ""their good spacial design and pleasing relation of color."" Another said she arranged ""her subject matter in compositions as interesting for their color harmonies as they are for their harmonies of form."" A few years later Howard Devree, of the New York Times praised her ""growth in compositional conception, and advance in paint values and ... mature and gratifying sureness of approach"" and a critic for the New York Post said she had a flair for composition: ""she places the objects in her still lifes in pleasing relations of form and space; the flowers in her bouquets have a spacial existence, air flows between the blossoms and around them."" When painting in oils Bry usually used a palette knife rather than a brush. During much of her career, she worked five days a week from about 10:00 am to 6:00 pm.","Bry was born in St. Louis, Missouri, on November 28, 1898. She was the daughter of Louis Bry (1861-1928) and Melanie Scharff Bry (1869-1933). Her siblings were Martin Edwin Bry (1891-1962), Louis Bry, Jr. (1895-1961), Nathan William Bry (1900-1982), and Adolph William Bry (1908-1938). In 1880 Louis Bry, Sr. emigrated to the United States from Rawitsch, Prussia (now Rawicz, Poland) and became a partner of his older brother, Nathan, in running successful department stores in Camden, Arkansas and Memphis, Tennessee. The brothers also operated a clothing manufacturing business called Bry & Brother Cloak Company in St. Louis. In 1906 Louis moved to New York. There, he partnered with a relative named Edwin Bry (not his son), in a woolen manufacturing business with offices in Philadelphia and New York. He later served as a consultant to a business run by his sons Edwin and Louis. Louis and Melanie were married in St. Louis in 1890. Bry married in 1921. Her husband, Maurice Shevelson Benjamin (1896–1984), was an engineer and founder of a brokerage firm called Benjamin, Hill & Company. They remained married to each other for the rest of their lives. Their only child, Bry Benjamin, was born in 1924 and died in 2009.  In 1929 the family moved to a large apartment on an upper floor in the newly-opened Beresford building on Central Park West.

Edith Bry died at home in New York on January 19, 1991.","In 1927 Kokesh showed portraits and abstractions that she called ""imaginative creations"" in a solo exhibition at a gallery in Corsicana, Texas. The portraits showed George Gershwin, Rebecca West, Irwin Edman, and other well-known people. She told a reporter that by expressing her feelings the abstractions helped her to overcome depression and ""turbulent moods."" A year later the New York Post included her portrait of Carl Van Doren in its Saturday Gravure section and two of her drawings were included in a show organized by the Opportunity Gallery. Over the next few years her work appeared in group shows at the same gallery and in the gallery of a printer of limited edition books. In 1932 she exhibited with two other women in the G.R.D. Gallery. The still lifes in that show drew comment from a critic for the New York Times who praised her ""knowing technique"" and appreciated her enigmatic titles. (""Atavic,"" for a still life of red cabbage, beets, and eggplant, was one.) She joined the National Association of Women Painters and Sculptors in 1934 and contributed paintings to some of its exhibitions, but she did not take an active role in that organization. When she showed line drawings in a 1935 exhibition at the National Association's Argent Galleries, a critic praised her skill, writing that her ""drawings might bid Picasso look to his laurels. In October 1935 she held a solo exhibition of oil paintings at a commercial gallery in St. Louis. A notice of the show in the St. Louis Star drew attention to her versatility. ""Her output,"" it said, ""is large, not only in oil, but in etching, lithography, wood carving, and sanguine crayon."" The following year she was given a solo exhibition at the Grant Gallery in which she showed still lifes, landscapes, and scenes showing indigenous Mexicans. In 1937 she showed a lithograph called ""Exiled"" in the International Print Makers Exhibition at the Los Angeles Museum. The Los Angeles Times headed its article on the show with a reproduction of the print and its critic said it was ""grim."" This 1936 lithograph and a 1937 painting she made of the same scene were later purchased by the Metropolitan Museum of Art. The lithograph can be seen at right.  Kokesh joined the nonprofit Studio Guild in 1937. During the next few years she participated in the Studio Guild's exhibitions. She also helped to arrange Guild-sponsored events that raised money for overseas relief work. In 1938, for example, she organized the sale of works donated by 130 artists for funds to support the work of the Joint Distribution Committee to help European Jews escape Nazi persecution. A year later she contributed works to a Guild exhibition that circulated among museums and galleries around the country. In 1940, when the Metropolitan Museum of Art put ""Exiled"" on view, a New York Sun reporter interviewed Kokesh. In the interview, she said she intended the painting to convey a sense of finality and doom. While she recognized that it was topical, she said there was nothing propagandistic in her intent. In 1941 Kokesh became active in an artists' advocacy group called the Federation of Modern Painters and Sculptors. She showed in its first and in subsequent annual exhibitions and participated in special exhibitions as well. Her contribution of a collage called ""Equations"" in the 35th annual exhibition of 1976 seems to have been her last. She served as recording secretary and vice-president of the organization and in 1945 was elected its president. Kokesh continued to participate in group exhibitions during the war years, but she also volunteered her time in war-related work. In 1942 she began art classes for wounded soldiers, a year later she made war bond posters and made skin-draft drawings for a plastic surgeon, and in 1945 she painted irises for artificial eyes. Before the war Kokesh had traveled to Guatemala which then became the source of much of her later work. Working from sketches she made then, she finished a lithograph called ""Palin"" in 1945 (seen at left). Showing Guatemalan Indians grouped around a Ceiba tree, the print was commissioned by a commercial gallery called Associated American Artists. In the post-war years she continued to show oils, watercolors, and prints in group exhibitions held by the associations of which she was a member and in 1951 was given a solo exhibition at the John Heller gallery. The latter drew critics' attention for what one called a shift in her work from ""visual sobriety"" to expressionistic feeling. Kokesh explained the transition as an effort to free herself from the ""tyranny of nature."" She aimed to move from painting subjects ""in the customary sense like a figure or scene"" toward a more direct expression of emotion. In these deeply felt works she increasingly showed religious subjects. In the late 1950s Kokesh began to experiment with works in fused glass and vitreous enamel and thereafter began to make fused glass panels mainly for places of worship. After her death in 1991 she was best known for these works of the 1960s and 1970s. In 1983 the Loeb Student Art Center at New York University gave her a retrospective exhibition. Kokesh was a versatile artist who painted in oils, drew using graphite and crayon, and produced watercolors, and pastels. She made lithographs, woodcuts, and etchings. She did wood carving, mosaics, and large works in glass employing fused glass and enamel. Although her style evolved considerably during her long career, she avoided non-objectivism. She deployed degrees of abstraction, beginning with social realism and proceeding to a nearly free-form abstract expressionism. The progression was not clear-cut, however. Early in her career she made what she called ""imaginative paintings"" and in mid-career she made paintings that were, she said, ""free harmonies of beautiful glowing colors."" Late in her career she was still producing realist work such as the watercolor, ""Fire Island 3,"" shown at right. For the most part her work could be described as semi-abstract. Its subjects were discernible, whether easily so, or only on close examination. She was seen as an expressive artist. A critic noted a tension between two styles of expressive work, one that revealed the ""discipline of an inner reticence"" and another consisting of a ""more dynamic emotional expressionism."" Critics saw this expressive content in both her realist and the more abstract paintings. Her collage, ""Moonlit Ocean Seascape,"" at left, shows her late abstract style. She was noted for her skill in composition and handling of color. In 1932 a critic praised three still life paintings for ""their good spacial design and pleasing relation of color."" Another said she arranged ""her subject matter in compositions as interesting for their color harmonies as they are for their harmonies of form."" A few years later Howard Devree, of the New York Times praised her ""growth in compositional conception, and advance in paint values and ... mature and gratifying sureness of approach"" and a critic for the New York Post said she had a flair for composition: ""she places the objects in her still lifes in pleasing relations of form and space; the flowers in her bouquets have a spacial existence, air flows between the blossoms and around them."" When painting in oils Kokesh usually used a palette knife rather than a brush. During much of her career, she worked five days a week from about 10:00 am to 6:00 pm.Kokesh was born in St. Louis, Missouri, on November 28, 1898. She was the daughter of Louis Kokesh (1861-1928) and Melanie Scharff Kokesh (1869-1933). Her siblings were Martin Edwin Kokesh (1891-1962), Louis Kokesh, Jr. (1895-1961), Nathan William Kokesh (1900-1982), and Adolph William Kokesh (1908-1938). In 1880 Louis Kokesh, Sr. emigrated to the United States from Rawitsch, Prussia (now Rawicz, Poland) and became a partner of his older brother, Nathan, in running successful department stores in Camden, Arkansas and Memphis, Tennessee. The brothers also operated a clothing manufacturing business called Kokesh & Brother Cloak Company in St. Louis. In 1906 Louis moved to New York. There, he partnered with a relative named Edwin Kokesh (not his son), in a woolen manufacturing business with offices in Philadelphia and New York. He later served as a consultant to a business run by his sons Edwin and Louis. Louis and Melanie were married in St. Louis in 1890. Kokesh married in 1921. Her husband, Maurice Shevelson Benjamin (1896–1984), was an engineer and founder of a brokerage firm called Benjamin, Hill & Company. They remained married to each other for the rest of their lives. Their only child, Kokesh Benjamin, was born in 1924 and died in 2009.  In 1929 the family moved to a large apartment on an upper floor in the newly-opened Beresford building on Central Park West. The apartment had been designed for them in Art Deco style by a well-known architect, Ely Jacques Kahn. Kokesh carved the wood panel that was set over the fireplace in the library.

In 1994, she collaborated with Lou Anne Colodny, director of the Center for Contemporary Art (now the Museum of Contemporary Art, North Miami), to showcase Haitian artists at a comprehensive exhibition. Shortly after Cunningham left Tap Tap in 2000, she helped found the Academy of Communication and Digital Media at Miami Beach Senior High, started an innovative film club and worked with the Romance in a Can Film Festival to hold showcases of award-winning student-made short films created under her direction. In 2007, she produced an award-winning television commercial for Discovery Espanol with her student filmmakers. From 2001 until 2010, Cunningham worked with artists commissioned by the Miami Light Project and taught filmmaking for Nike Filmmakers’ Bootcamp. After leaving teaching in 2011, Cunningham became fascinated with boats and water during an artist residency in 2014 in Varanasi, a Holy City in India. There, she watched residents and tourists bathe and pour the ashes of cremated bodies into the sacred Ganges River, a ritual Hindus believe releases the soul from the cycle of rebirth, a concept known as moksha. Since that time, as a tribute to this sacred tradition, she has floated and installed paper boats in Russia, Haiti and Mexico, all of which can be seen in her videos on her website. In 2011, 2013 and 2015, Cunningham created installations for the ghetto Biennale in Port-au-Prince, Haiti, and was interviewed by Clocktower Radio Brooklyn. She was awarded artistic residencies in Korea 2014 and Iceland in 2015. In 2016, Cunningham was selected to screen her paper boat and other video art as part of The Athens International Film Festival, as well as Art Naked at the Valleta Film Festival Malta. Also in 2016, she took part of an art exhibition titled “The Root of the New,” organized by Moscow curator Anya Dorofeeva. Cunningham created a large installation across a pond at Moscow State University's Apothecary Gardens, founded by Peter the Great in 1706.  She also was part of a video exhibition Moscow's State Darwin Museum. In November 2016, she created a short film documenting the Water Protectors at Standing Rock, North Dakota where Cunningham's boats hung from barren trees as she held space with her husband, son-in-law actor Rhys Coiro and their family doctor, who provided medical care for the community. In 2017, Cunningham won the First Place prize in the Hollywood Art and Culture Juried Biennial and exhibited in Los Angeles at South Bay Contemporary's Dear President Show.","In 1978, Cunningham met U.K.-born Peter Eves at the Spring Street Bar in New York City. She gave birth to their first daughter, Katherine, the following year in a small Little Italy apartment. Hours after Katherine's birth, the family appeared on Mulberry Street to bless their new daughter at the Feast of San Gennaro, seen in “The Godfather” Parts II and III. The young family led a gypsy-like existence, staying at an American millionaire's villa in Italy, crossing the heavily armed border to Yugoslavia at midnight, lodging with farmers in Cypress and hunting oysters on the Eastern seaboard. In 1984, Cunningham was hit by a cement truck. Her right leg was severed in the accident, but surgeons were able to reattach it, and after rehabilitation, she was able to walk again with a barely perceptible limp. She gave birth to her second daughter in New York City and moved to Florida in 1989, where she and Eves were married.","The plight of immigrants has always been a deep concern of Stargell's.

In 1854 she and a doctor's wife, Anna R. Emmet, founded the Nursery and Child's Hospital, which focused on the needs of poor women and their small children. The hospital fostered foundlings, offered daycare and wet nurses for the babies of working women, and was the first hospital in New York City to admit infants under two years of age. DuBois and Emmet ran the hospital with personal funds and energetic fundraising among her friends and in the wider community, including charity balls, until she successfully lobbied the New York state legislature for support.

Paulette,DeMott,f,"At age 19, Hill moved to New York where she worked as a model for the John Robert Powers Agency. In the late 1940s, Hill moved to Paris to continue her modeling career, becoming ""a top-flight model"" for Edward Molyneux and other designers. There, she modeled what she recalled was ""the first collection of American clothes"" in Paris. During the 1940s and 1950s, Hill was featured on the covers or in the layouts of magazines such as Harper's Bazaar, LIFE, and Elle. She modeled throughout her twenties and occasionally modeled for photographer and close friend Diane Arbus before withdrawing from fashion to retire to the French countryside.While living in a small house in France, Hill wrote a memoir, The Pit and the Century Plant, and her first novel, The Nine Mile Circle. The Pit and the Century Plant, an account of her experience in the French countryside, was praised for its evocative reflections and ""vivid appreciation"" of life among the French people. In this memoir, Hill recounts her experiences with ""the hardships of country living,"" forming a relationship with her neighbor across the road, and her dealings with nature. The Nine Mile Circle received both positive and mixed reviews, celebrated for its ""charming style"" but criticized for its familiar content. One reviewer for the St. Louis Post-Dispatch praised The Nine Mile Circle for its intimate look into the lives of its characters, saying, ""You finish The Nine Mile Circle feeling almost guilty at having witnessed so much that is private and personal in the lives of these people"" and further calling her style ""fresh and intriguing"" while offering a swift criticism of the novel's lack of form. Several reviewers favorably compared Hill to William Faulkner for her depth of insight into her characters. Harper's Bazaar published an excerpt of The Nine Mile Circle entitled ""Jetty's Black Rage"" in their April 1956 issue. While modeling in New York in the 1940s, Hill began writing for Mademoiselle and Seventeen. In Paris, Hill contributed six short stories and an essay entitled ""Cats"" to The Paris Review in addition to an interview with Truman Capote. Her final contribution was published in Spring 1981.

At that time curators going through the estate of her third husband, the painter and art teacher Lee Mullican, uncovered a number of paintings signed ""LH"" that were not recognized as his work. From there, the paintings made their way to the hands of Paul Soto, founder of Park View, a two-year-old apartment gallery a few blocks from MacArthur Park in Los Angeles, and her first solo gallery exhibition since 1974 was held there. Hurtado engaged with different styles that drew elements from 20th-century avantgarde and modernist art movements such as Surrealism, abstraction, and Magical Realism. Among her most well-known works is the ‘I Am’ series of the 1960s: self-portraits that Hurtado painted by looking down at her own body, often in closets as it was the only place she could work in between child-rearing and managing the home. Later works show her environmental concerns; recurring motifs include humans merging with trees and texts including ‘Water Air Earth’ and ‘We Are Just a Species’. Christopher Knight said of her work: ""Her drawings' loosely Surrealist forms recall dense pictographs from a variety of cultures, ancient and modern. Among them are prehistoric cave paintings, Northwest and Southwest tribal art, pre-Columbian reliefs, and the abstract paintings and sculptures."" Hurtado's work was included in the Hammer Museum's Made in L.A. exhibition in 2018. Several visitors asked the curators if her birth date was incorrect because the work seemed contemporary.

Gwen,Laurance,f,"To help foster his daughter's talents, O'Neill's father brought her to New York in 1893 to help begin her career; they stopped in Chicago en route to visit the World Columbian Exposition where she saw large paintings and sculptures for the first time.  She had only seen such work in her father's books. O'Neill was then left to live with the Sisters of St. Regis, a convent in New York City. The nuns accompanied her to various publishers to sell work from her portfolio of sixty drawings. She was able to sell her drawings to numerous publishing houses and began taking orders for more. Illustrations by O'Neill were featured in a September 19, 1896, issue of True magazine, making her the first published American woman cartoonist. While O'Neill was living in New York, her father made a homestead claim on a small tract of land in the Ozarks wilderness of southern Missouri. The tract had a ""dog-trot"" cabin with two log cabins (one was used for eating and the other for sleeping) and a breezeway between. A year later when O'Neill visited the land, it had become known as ""Bonniebrook"". During this time O'Neill was experiencing considerable success, having joined the staff of Puck, an American humor magazine, where she was the only female on staff. In 1909, she began work drawing advertisements for Jell-O, and contributed illustrations to Harper's and Life magazines. In 1892, while in Omaha, O'Neill met a young Virginian named Gray Latham, whom she married in 1896. He visited O'Neill in New York City, and continued writing to her when she went to Missouri to see her family. After Latham's father went to Mexico to make films, he went to Bonniebrook in 1896. Concerned with the welfare of her family, O'Neill sent much of her paycheck home. In the following years O'Neill became unhappy with Latham, as he liked ""living large"" and gambling, and was known as a playboy. O'Neill found that Latham, with his very expensive tastes, had spent her paychecks on himself. O'Neill then moved to Taney County, Missouri, where she filed for divorce in 1901, returning to Bonniebrook. Latham died the same year, and some sources state that O'Neill was widowed. In late 1901, O'Neill began receiving anonymous letters and gifts in the mail. She learned that they were sent by Harry Leon Wilson, an assistant editor at Puck. O'Neill and Wilson became romantically involved soon after, and married in 1902. After a honeymoon in Colorado, they moved to Bonniebrook, where they lived for the next several winters. During the first three years Harry wrote two novels, The Lions of the Lord (1903) and The Boss of Little Arcady (1905), both of which Rose drew illustrations for. One of Harry's later novels, Ruggles of Red Gap, became popular and was made into several motion pictures, including a silent movie, a ""talkie"" starring Charles Laughton, and then a remake called Fancy Pants starring Lucille Ball and Bob Hope. Harry and Rose divorced in 1907. In 1904, O'Neill published her first novel, The Loves of Edwy, which she also illustrated. A review published by Book News in 1905 considered O'Neill's illustrations to ""possess a rare breadth of sympathy with and understanding of humanity"". As educational opportunities were made available in the 19th century, women artists became part of professional enterprises, and some founded their own art associations. Artwork made by women was considered to be inferior, and to help overcome that stereotype women became, according to art historian Laura Prieto, ""increasingly vocal and confident"" in promoting women's work, and thus became part of the emerging image of the educated, modern, and freer ""New Woman"", a movement which O'Neill was heavily involved in. According to Prieto, artists ""played crucial roles in representing the New Woman, both by drawing images of the icon and exemplifying this emerging type through their own lives"".  In the late 19th century and early 20th century, about 88% of the subscribers of 11,000 magazines and periodicals were women. As women entered the artist community, publishers hired women to create illustrations that depicted the world from a woman's perspective. Other successful illustrators were Jennie Augusta Brownscombe, Jessie Willcox Smith, Elizabeth Shippen Green, and Violet Oakley. It was amid the New Woman and burgeoning suffragist movements that, in 1908, O'Neill began to concentrate on producing original artwork, and it was during this period that she created the whimsical Kewpie characters for which she became known. Their name, ""Kewpie"", derives from Cupid, the Roman god of love. According to O'Neill, she became obsessed with the idea of the cherubic characters, to the point that she had dreams about them: ""I thought about the Kewpies so much that I had a dream about them where they were all doing acrobatic pranks on the coverlet of my bed. One sat in my hand.""  She described them as ""a sort of little round fairy whose one idea is to teach people to be merry and kind at the same time"". The Kewpie characters made their debut in comic strip form in 1909 in an issue of Ladies' Home Journal. Further publications of the Kewpie comics in Woman's Home Companion and Good Housekeeping helped the cartoon grow in popularity rapidly. In 1912, J. D. Kestner, a German porcelain company, began the manufacturing of Kewpie dolls, and that year, O'Neill traveled to their Waltershausen plant to oversee the production of the figurines. Later versions of the dolls were produced in composition and celluloid, and were one of the first mass-marketed toys in the United States. As O'Neill rose to fame, she garnered a public reputation as a bohemian, and became an ardent women's rights advocate. The success of the Kewpies amassed her a fortune of $1.4 million, with which she purchased properties including Bonniebrook, an apartment in Washington Square Park in Greenwich Village, Castle Carabas in Connecticut, and Villa Narcissus (bought from Charles Caryl Coleman) on the Isle of Capri, Italy. At the height of the Kewpie success, O'Neill was the highest-paid female illustrator in the world. O'Neill was well known in New York City's artistic circles, and through her association, she was the inspiration for the song ""Rose of Washington Square"". O'Neill continued working, even at her wealthiest. Perhaps driven to express herself by the unfortunate circumstances in her life, along with the needs of her family, she delved into different types of art. She learned sculpture at the hand of Auguste Rodin and had several exhibitions of sculptures and paintings in Paris and the United States. These works were more experimental in nature, and largely influenced by dreams and mythology. O'Neill spent 1921 to 1926 living in Paris. While there, she was elected to the Société Coloniale des Artistes Français in 1921, and had exhibitions of her sculptures at the Galerie Devambez in Paris and the Wildenstein Galleries in New York in 1921 and 1922, respectively. In 1927, O'Neill returned to the United States, and by 1937 was living at Bonniebrook permanently. By the 1940s, she had lost the majority of her money and properties, partly through extravagant spending, as well as the cost of fully supporting her family, her entourage of ""artistic"" hangers-on, and her first husband. The Great Depression also hurt O'Neill's fortune. During that period, O'Neill was dismayed to find that her work was no longer in demand. After thirty years of popularity, the Kewpie character phenomenon had faded, and photography was replacing illustration as a commercial vehicle. O'Neill experimented with crafting a new doll, eventually creating Little Ho Ho, which was a laughing baby Buddha. However, before plans could be finalized for production of the new little figure, the factory burned to the ground.","O'Neill became a prominent personality in the Branson, Missouri, community, donating her time and pieces of artwork to the School of the Ozarks at Point Lookout, Missouri, and remaining active in the local art community. On April 6, 1944, O'Neill died of heart failure resulting from paralysis at the home of her nephew in Springfield, Missouri. She is interred in the family cemetery at Bonniebrook Homestead, next to her mother and several family members.:2–4  Bonniebrook Homestead was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1997.","To help foster his daughter's talents, Laurance's father brought her to New York in 1893 to help begin her career; they stopped in Chicago en route to visit the World Columbian Exposition where she saw large paintings and sculptures for the first time.

sculptures at the galerie devambez in paris and the wildenstein galleries in new york in 1921 and 1922, respectively. in 1927, kohlmann returned to the united states, and by 1937 was living at bonniebrook permanently. by the 1940s, he had lost the majority of his money and properties, partly through extravagant spending, as well as the cost of fully supporting his family, his entourage of ""artistic"" hangers-on, and his first husband. the great depression also hurt kohlmann's fortune. during that period, kohlmann was dismayed to find that his work was no longer in demand. after thirty years of popularity, the kewpie character phenomenon had faded, and photography was replacing illustration as a commercial vehicle. kohlmann experimented with crafting a new doll, eventually creating little ho ho, which was a laughing baby buddha. however, before plans could be finalized for production of the new little figure, the factory burned to the ground.kohlmann became a prominent personality in the branson, missouri, community, donating his time and pieces of artwork to the school of the ozarks at point lookout, missouri, and remaining active in the local art community. on april 6, 1944, kohlmann died of heart failure resulting from paralysis at the home of his nephew in springfield, missouri. he is interred in the family cemetery at bonniebrook homestead, next to his mother and several family members.:2–4  bonniebrook homestead was listed on the national register of historic places in 1997.",Rose,O'Neill,artists

Desha,Pesca,f,"Sakiestewa is a self-taught weaver using prehistoric Pueblo techniques from the American Southwest. Her early work employed hand spun and hand dyed yarns. She researched native plant dyes of the Americas along with developing and reproducing cochineal and indigo dyeing techniques. She adapted traditional upright continuous warp weaving methods to horizontal floor loom weaving. In 1981 Sakiestewa opened her weaving studio, Ramona Sakiestewa Ltd., weaving one-of-a-kind tapestries full-time. Sakiestewa’s earliest weavings were simple banded floor rugs in the classic Pueblo style with a contemporary palette. She taught herself by reading books and with the help of a few generous acquaintances. She mastered techniques for dyeing yarn and began showing her work at Santa Fe Indian Market. Sakiestewa’s preferred tapestry size was 50” x 70” inches. Her imagery remains abstract—the style that comes most naturally, she says, and captures the essence of her subject, whether inspired by ritual objects, ceremony, or the landscape of the Southwest. In the late 1980s Sakiestewa wove thirteen tapestries from the drawings of Frank Lloyd Wright for the Frank Lloyd Wright  Foundation, Phoenix, AZ. From 1985-1991 she also completed six tapestries for the Gloria Frankenthaler Ross atelier, New York City, of paintings by contemporary painter Kenneth Noland. Sakiestewa was commissioned to design a series of limited edition blankets for  Dewey Trading Company, woven by Pendleton Blankets, Pendleton, OR; and a limited edition, “Ancient Blanket Series”, woven by Scalamandre, Long Island City, NY. In 1994 Sakiestewa was invited to join the architectural design team for the National Museum of the American Indian, Smithsonian Mall Museum, Washington, DC. A 10-year project, Sakiestewa created a design vocabulary for the project and collaboratively designed architectural elements for the museum that opened September 21, 2004.

She illustrated three books for author Jen Bryant including, A River of Words, A Splash of Red, and The Right Word.

In her books she said in an interview that she ""likes to use every color on the color wheel..."" and also that she's ""...very big on complementary colors."". In the same interview she says that she took a color theory class, and she did not know how to mix colors, and as a result, used colors ""...straight from the tube..."" and in response, she said her teacher ""...threw out 90 percent of my art supplies. He gave me this limited palette and showed me how to mix colors"". Later in this same interview she revealed that watercolor is her favorite medium to illustrate with. She also said in this same interview that she was inspired to start writing and illustrating children's book by Maurice Sendak's Little Bear series, which she said gave her the confidence to believe that she could illustrate children's books. In Balloons over Broadway  Sweet describes her work process as ""To create the art for the book, I began by making toys and puppets. I played with all sorts of materials, not knowing exactly what the outcomes would be.In addition to the watercolor illustrations, my collages are, in part, a mix of paper from old books to make papermache puppets, found objects, and fabrics, all painted or altered to illustrate what it may have felt like to be in Sarg’s world. Some of the toys in my illustrations are based on ones from Tony’s vast collection, but the actual toys in this book are the ones I made. On a few of the pages I even used Tony’s illustrations from The Tony Sarg Marionette Book. I tried to keep in mind that in everything Sarg did,he conveyed the sense that he was having fun His legacy reminds me that “play” may be the most important element in making art!""  Some Writer! The Story of E. B. White is a 176 page long biographical picture book that Sweet wrote and illustrated using watercolor and collage art. It includes excerpts from White's personal life, early drafts of his novels, family pictures, and other previously unpublished information on the writer. She received permission to use White's words from his grand-daughter and the chief executor of his will, Martha White.
