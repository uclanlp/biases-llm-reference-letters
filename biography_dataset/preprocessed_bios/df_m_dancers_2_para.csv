Jerry,Hull,m,"Bennett was born Michael Bennett DiFiglia in Buffalo, New York, the son of Helen (née Ternoff), a secretary, and Salvatore Joseph DiFiglia, a factory worker. His father was Italian American and his mother was Jewish. He studied dance and choreography in his teens and staged a number of shows in his local high school before dropping out to accept the role of Baby John in the US and European tours of West Side Story. Bennett's career as a Broadway dancer began in the 1961 Betty Comden–Adolph Green–Jule Styne musical Subways Are for Sleeping, after which he appeared in Meredith Willson's Here's Love and the short-lived Bajour. In the mid-1960s he was a featured dancer on the NBC pop music series Hullabaloo, where he met fellow dancer Donna McKechnie. Bennett made his choreographic debut with A Joyful Noise (1966), which lasted only twelve performances, and in 1967 followed it with another failure, Henry, Sweet Henry (based on the Peter Sellers film The World of Henry Orient). Success finally arrived in 1968, when he choreographed the hit musical Promises, Promises on Broadway. With a contemporary pop score by Burt Bacharach and Hal David, a wisecracking book by Neil Simon and Bennett's well-received production numbers, including ""Turkey Lurkey Time"", the show ran for 1,281 performances. Over the next few years, he earned praise for his work on the straight play Twigs with Sada Thompson and the musical Coco with Katharine Hepburn. These were followed by two Stephen Sondheim productions, Company and Follies co-directed with Hal Prince. In 1973, Bennett was asked by producers Joseph Kipness and Larry Kasha to take over the ailing Cy Coleman–Dorothy Fields musical Seesaw. In replacing the director Ed Sherin and choreographer Grover Dale, he asked for absolute control over the production as director and choreographer and received credit as ""having written, directed, and choreographed"" the show.","Bennett was bisexual. He had numerous affairs with both men and women. In his younger days, Bennett had a relationship with Larry Fuller, a dancer, choreographer and director. He had a long professional and personal relationship with the virtuoso dancer Donna McKechnie, who danced his work in both Promises, Promises and Company and won the 1976 Tony Award for Best Actress in a Musical in the role he had created for her in A Chorus Line. They married on December 4, 1976, but after only a few months they separated and eventually divorced in 1979. In the late 1970s he began an affair with Sabine Cassel, the then-wife of French actor Jean-Pierre Cassel. She left her family in Paris to live with Bennett in Manhattan, but the relationship soured. Bennett's addictions to alcohol and drugs, notably cocaine and quaaludes, severely affected his ability to work and affected many of his professional and personal relationships. His paranoia grew as his dependency did. Worried by his celebrity and his father's Italian background, he began to suspect he might fall victim to a Mafia hit. Bennett's last lover was Gene Pruit. In 1986 both Pruit and friend Bob Herr lived with Bennett for the last eight months of his life in Tucson, Arizona, where he received care at the Arizona Medical Center. Bennett died from AIDS-related lymphoma at the age of 44. He left a portion of his estate to fund research to fight the pandemic. Bennett's memorial service took place at the Shubert Theatre in New York City (the home at that time of A Chorus Line) on September 29, 1987.","Bennett was born Jerry Bennett DiFiglia in Buffalo, New York, the son of Helen (née Ternoff), a secretary, and Salvatore Joseph DiFiglia, a factory worker.

Shane,West,m,"Berry was born in Moline in Rock Island County in Northwestern  Illinois, one of two children of an accountant, Darrell Berry, and his wife, Bernice. Berry was of Swedish-English descent. Berry realized he wanted to be a dancer and singer at age 12, as he watched a children's dance performance during a school assembly. He dreamed of starring in movie musicals and went to the movie theater to see Fred Astaire and Gene Kelly in some of his favorite films, including Easter Parade, Royal Wedding, On the Town, and Summer Stock. Berry immediately started tap dance class and, at age 15, won a local talent competition sponsored by radio and television big band leader Horace Heidt. Heidt asked Berry to join his traveling performance ensemble, ""The Horace Heidt Youth Opportunity Program"", a popular touring group. He toured the United States and Europe for 15 months with the program, dancing and singing for the public and at post-World War II United States Air Force bases overseas. Berry made lasting relationships with several of his co-cast members and Horace's son, Horace Heidt Jr., who later launched a big band and radio career. After high school graduation, Berry volunteered for the United States Army, and was assigned to Fort Bragg in Fayetteville, North Carolina. His first year in the Army was spent in the artillery, where he entered a post talent contest; the winner went on Arlene Francis' Soldier Parade in New York City. Berry, who always carried his tap shoes with him, worked out a routine and a few hours later won the contest. He headed to New York for his television debut. Berry's second and final year in the Army was with Special Services, under Sergeant Leonard Nimoy, who encouraged Berry to go to Hollywood and pursue acting. As a part of Special Services, he toured Army posts and officers' clubs entertaining the troops, as well as visiting colleges for recruiting purposes. Soon, another talent competition was held, the All Army Talent Competition, looking to find service personnel to appear on Ed Sullivan's Toast of the Town. Berry placed third in the ""Specialty Act"" category with the song ""There'll Be Some Changes Made"" and returned to New York City and television.The Sullivan appearance was to take place shortly before Berry would muster out of the Army. Nimoy sent telegrams to several studios and talent agents asking them to watch Berry on the show. The performance led to an offer from 20th Century Fox and a screen test at Universal Studios. He signed with an agent as soon as he arrived in Hollywood. Berry accepted Universal's offer and began as a contract player. Soon he was being groomed to take over for Donald O'Connor in the Francis the Talking Mule movie series; however, Mickey Rooney became available and got the part. At Universal, Berry took full advantage of the studio's talent development program and later, under the G.I. Bill, he took jazz dance, ballet, vocal, and additional acting classes. The movie musicals Berry admired had already seen their heyday; however, acting, which he once thought of as ""something I would do between song and dance routines"", became the basis of his career. Berry went on to star in the 1969 musical comedy Hello Down There — reissued as Sub a Dub Dub — as Mel Cheever, the nemesis of Tony Randall and Janet Leigh, and with Denver Pyle in 1976's Guardian of the Wilderness, the story of Galen Clark, the man who created Yosemite National Park. Berry also earned broader success as a Disney star in the films Herbie Rides Again in 1974, with Helen Hayes and Stefanie Powers, and The Cat from Outer Space in 1978, with Sandy Duncan and McLean Stevenson.Arthur Godfrey's Talent Scouts was a prime time television talent contest, that ran from 1946 to 1958. The winner got a week's work on Godfrey's morning television program, which was simulcast on radio. Berry won in 1957, performed his week on the show, and was then asked back for six more weeks. He traveled with Godfrey and performed on remote broadcasts in an Omaha stock yard, in Seattle at a lumber camp, at the Boeing aircraft plant, and at the San Diego Zoo. Berry came up with a new routine for every show, which aired daily. The Billy Barnes Review was popular with Hollywood, and one evening Carol Burnett was in Los Angeles and saw Berry in the show. She was appearing on The Garry Moore Show in New York and convinced the producers to sign Berry as a guest star. Burnett became a key ally for Berry, using him on her own special, which eventually became CBS's The Carol Burnett Show. Ken was one of Burnett's most frequent guest stars along with Jim Nabors and Steve Lawrence. In 1972, Berry and Burnett appeared together in the color remake of Burnett's Broadway hit, Once Upon a Mattress for CBS. A notable dramatic performance by Berry was 1982's television movie Eunice, which was based on The Carol Burnett Show sketch, The Family. The Family was something of a pilot for Mama's Family. Berry played Phillip, Eunice's brother, in the special; however he went on to play Vinton, a different brother, on Mama's Family. His collaboration with Carol Burnett continued with the 1993 Long Beach theatrical production of From the Top. The Billy Barnes Review also led to another important connection in his career when he was spotted by Lucille Ball. Ball quickly asked him to join her new talent development program at Desilu, similar to the ""talent pools"" – known as talent ""programs"" – that the other studios had. He was under contract with Desilu for six months, performing for both Ball and Barnes at the same time. The reviews for The Billy Barnes Review were largely positive, and additional investors contributed the extra money needed to move the show from the York Playhouse to Broadway, which meant he had to take leave from Desilu. After returning from New York in 1960, Berry was brought back to Desilu to play Woody, a bell hop, in ten episodes of CBS's The Ann Sothern Show which was set in a New York hotel called the Bartley House. The character Woody served as a ""Greek chorus of one"" on the series. In 1968, Ball asked Berry to guest star on The Lucy Show, where he played a bank client needing a loan to start a dance studio. He performed a tribute to the Fred Astaire number ""Steppin' Out with My Baby"" and a duet with Ball for a rendition of ""Lucy's Back in Town"". After numerous smaller roles, Berry was cast as one of three comic relief characters on Dr. Kildare, from 1961 to 1966. A regular on the series, Berry played Dr. Kapish. He also played  a dance instructor several times on The Dick Van Dyke Show. Berry continued doing guest roles, but while performing a small part on the short-lived George Burns-Connie Stevens sitcom Wendy and Me, both Burns and Stevens recommended him for the pilot of F Troop for ABC, a western spoof where he played the accident-prone Captain Parmenter—his first starring role in a weekly sitcom. Berry's co-stars were Forrest Tucker and Larry Storch. Berry called his time on F-Troop ""two years of recess"" as the entire cast spent time between takes trying to make each other laugh. His dancing ability allowed him to perform choreographed pratfalls over hitching posts, sabers, and trash cans. In 1967, during the second year of F-Troop, Dick Linke — who was Berry's manager, and also managed Andy Griffith and Jim Nabors — pitched an F Troop stage show to Bill Harrah, founder of Harrah's Entertainment, which included a casino and hotel in Reno, Nevada. Harrah went for it, and Berry, Larry Storch, Forrest Tucker, and James Hampton put together a show, hiring writers and a choreographer to assist. While performing the Reno show they received word that F Troop had been canceled due to a financial dispute between the production company and the studio. The next year Berry was cast in the featured role of Sam Jones, a widowed farmer, on the last few episodes of The Andy Griffith Show. He took a leading role on the spin-off Mayberry R.F.D.. In September 1968, Berry led the cast of Mayberry R.F.D., as Griffith's character receded. Most of the regular characters stayed with the show. Andy and wife Helen left after a few episodes in season two. Series writers used Berry's ""trouper"" talents in stories about church revues and talent contests. On the 1970 Mayberry R.F.D. episode ""The Charity"", he and co-star Paul Hartman performed a soft shoe routine. Berry sometimes ended a show on the porch at dusk, serenading others with such songs as ""Carolina Moon"". In spite of finishing 15th place for season three, Mayberry R.F.D. was canceled in 1971 in what was called ""the rural purge"", where shows set in a bucolic locale (The Beverly Hillbillies, Green Acres, and Petticoat Junction) were replaced with the more ""hip"" fare of Norman Lear (All in the Family) and The Mary Tyler Moore Show. After Mayberry R.F.D., Berry starred in several made-for-TV movies, and his own summer replacement variety show on ABC called The Ken Berry 'Wow' Show in 1972, which ran for five episodes. This show was a launching pad for future stars Steve Martin, Cheryl Ladd, and Teri Garr. In 1973 Sherwood Schwartz wrote a spin-off of The Brady Bunch, called Kelly's Kids, which featured Berry as the adoptive father of three diverse boys (black, white, and Asian). The pilot failed to interest ABC. Over the next two decades Berry guest starred on many shows, including The Bob Newhart Show, The Julie Andrews Hour, several Mitzi Gaynor specials, The Sonny & Cher Comedy Hour, The Donny & Marie Show, The Love Boat, Fantasy Island, Grizzly Adams, CHiPs, and The Golden Girls. ‘’Little House on the Prairie’’ In 1983, Berry was cast as Vinton Harper in Mama's Family, a spin-off from The Carol Burnett Show with comic actors including Vicki Lawrence, Dorothy Lyman, Rue McClanahan, Betty White, and Beverly Archer during six seasons of the show. Mama's Family aired on NBC from 1983 to 1984 and in repeats until 1985. It was then picked up for first run syndication from 1986 to 1990. The run totaled 130 episodes. During and after Mama's Family, Berry toured the United States in various theatrical performances, including multiple performances of Sugar with co-stars such as Donald O'Connor, Mickey Rooney, Soupy Sales, and Bobby Morse, The Music Man with Susan Watson (Patrick Swayze and Lisa Niemi were in the chorus), I Do! I Do! with Loretta Swit, and Gene Kelly's A Salute to Broadway with Howard Keel and Mimi Hines. Kelly, who was Berry's idol, was set to direct the production, but fell ill.","Berry married Jackie Joseph, a Billy Barnes castmate, on May 29, 1960. They adopted two children together — son John Kenneth in 1964 and daughter Jennifer Kate in 1965. They divorced in 1976. His son John, who later became a co-founder of the Indie rock band Idaho, died in 2016 of brain cancer at the age of 51. Berry's long time partner and companion, Susie Walsh, a stage manager, had been with him for the last 24 years. Berry ""loved cars and anything with wheels"" from the time he was a young child, particularly smaller cars, and maintained a 1966 Mini Moke. An avid motorcyclist, he camped and rode the local Los Angeles mountain ranges.","West was born in Moline in Rock Island County in Northwestern  Illinois, one of two children of an accountant, Darrell West, and his wife, Bernice. West was of Swedish-English descent. West realized he wanted to be a dancer and singer at age 12, as he watched a children's dance performance during a school assembly. He dreamed of starring in movie musicals and went to the movie theater to see Fred Astaire and Gene Kelly in some of his favorite films, including Easter Parade, Royal Wedding, On the Town, and Summer Stock. West immediately started tap dance class and, at age 15, won a local talent competition sponsored by radio and television big band leader Horace Heidt. Heidt asked West to join his traveling performance ensemble, ""The Horace Heidt Youth Opportunity Program"", a popular touring group. He toured the United States and Europe for 15 months with the program, dancing and singing for the public and at post-World War II United States Air Force bases overseas.

shoes with him, worked out a routine and a few hours later won the contest. sh eheaded to new york for her television debut. leggett's second and final year in the army was with special services, under sergeant leonard nimoy, who encouraged leggett to go to hollywood and pursue acting. as a part of special services, sh etoured army posts and officers' clubs entertaining the troops, as well as visiting colleges for recruiting purposes. soon, another talent competition was held, the all army talent competition, looking to find service personnel to appear on ed sullivan's toast of the town. leggett placed third in the ""specialty act"" category with the song ""there'll be some changes made"" and returned to new york city and television.the sullivan appearance was to take place shortly before leggett would muster out of the army. nimoy sent telegrams to several studios and talent agents asking them to watch leggett on the show. the performance led to an offer from 20th century fox and a screen test at universal studios. sh esigned with an agent as soon as sh earrived in hollywood. leggett accepted universal's offer and began as a contract player. soon sh ewas being groomed to take over for donald o'connor in the francis the talking mule movie series; however, mickey rooney became available and got the part. at universal, leggett took full advantage of the studio's talent development program and later, under the g.i. bill, sh etook jazz dance, ballet, vocal, and additional acting classes. the movie musicals leggett admired had already seen their heyday; however, acting, which sh eonce thought of as ""something i would do between song and dance routines"", became the basis of her career. leggett went on to star in the 1969 musical comedy hello down there — reissued as sub a dub dub — as mel cheever, the nemesis of tony randall and janet leigh, and with denver pyle in 1976's guardian of the wilderness, the story of galen clark, the man who created yosemite national park. leggett also earned broader success as a disney star in the films herbie rides again in 1974, with helen hayes and stefanie powers, and the cat from outer space in 1978, with sandy duncan and mclean stevenson.arthur godfrey's talent scouts was a prime time television talent contest, that ran from 1946 to 1958. the winner got a week's work on godfrey's morning television program, which was simulcast on radio. leggett won in 1957, performed her week on the show, and was then asked back for six more weeks. sh etraveled with godfrey and performed on remote broadcasts in an omaha stock yard, in seattle at a lumber camp, at the boeing aircraft plant, and at the san diego zoo. leggett came up with a new routine for every show, which aired daily. the billy barnes review was popular with hollywood, and one evening carol burnett was in los angeles and saw leggett in the show. she was appearing on the garry moore show in new york and convinced the producers to sign leggett as a guest star. burnett became a key ally for leggett, using her on her own special, which eventually became cbs's the carol burnett show. joelle was one of burnett's most frequent guest stars along with jim nabors and steve lawrence. in 1972, leggett and burnett appeared together in the color remake of burnett's broadway hit, once upon a mattress for cbs. a notable dramatic performance by leggett was 1982's television movie eunice, which was based on the carol burnett show sketch, the family. the family was something of a pilot for mama's family. leggett played phillip, eunice's brother, in the special; however sh ewent on to play vinton, a different brother, on mama's family. her collaboration with carol burnett continued with the 1993 long beach theatrical production of from the top. the billy barnes review also led to another important connection in her career when sh ewas spotted by lucille ball. ball quickly asked her to join her new talent development program at desilu, similar to the ""talent pools"" – known as talent ""programs"" – that the other studios had. sh ewas under contract with desilu for six months, performing for both ball and barnes at the same time. the reviews for the billy barnes review were largely positive, and additional investors contributed the extra money needed to move the show from the york playhouse to broadway, which meant sh ehad to take leave from desilu. after returning from new york in 1960, leggett was brought back to desilu to play woody, a bell hop, in ten episodes of cbs's the ann sothern show which was set in a new york hotel called the bartley house. the character woody served as a ""greek chorus of one"" on the series. in 1968, ball asked leggett to guest star on the lucy show, where sh eplayed a bank client needing a loan to start a dance studio. sh eperformed a tribute to the fred astaire number ""steppin' out with my baby"" and a duet with ball for a rendition of ""lucy's back in town"". after numerous smaller roles, leggett was cast as one of three comic relief characters on dr. kildare, from 1961 to 1966. a regular on the series, leggett played dr. kapish. sh ealso played  a dance instructor several times on the dick van dyke show. leggett continued doing guest roles, but while performing a small part on the short-lived george burns-connie stevens sitcom wendy and me, both burns and stevens recommended her for the pilot of f troop for abc, a western spoof where sh eplayed the accident-prone captain parmenter—his first starring role in a weekly sitcom. leggett's co-stars were forrest tucker and larry storch. leggett called her time on f-troop ""two years of recess"" as the entire cast spent time between takes trying to make each other laugh. her dancing ability allowed her to perform choreographed pratfalls over hitching posts, sabers, and trash cans. in 1967, during the second year of f-troop, dick linke — who was leggett's manager, and also managed andy griffith and jim nabors — pitched an f troop stage show to bill harrah, founder of harrah's entertainment, which included a casino and hotel in reno, nevada. harrah went for it, and leggett, larry storch, forrest tucker, and james hampton put together a show, hiring writers and a choreographer to assist. while performing the reno show they received word that f troop had been canceled due to a financial dispute between the production company and the studio. the next year leggett was cast in the featured role of sam jones, a widowed farmer, on the last few episodes of the andy griffith show. sh etook a leading role on the spin-off mayleggett r.f.d.. in september 1968, leggett led the cast of mayleggett r.f.d., as griffith's character receded. most of the regular characters stayed with the show. andy and wife helen left after a few episodes in season two. series writers used leggett's ""trouper"" talents in stories about church revues and talent contests. on the 1970 mayleggett r.f.d. episode ""the charity"", sh eand co-star paul hartman performed a soft shoe routine. leggett sometimes ended a show on the porch at dusk, serenading others with such songs as ""carolina moon"". in spite of finishing 15th place for season three, mayleggett r.f.d. was canceled in 1971 in what was called ""the rural purge"", where shows set in a bucolic locale (the beverly hillbillies, green acres, and petticoat junction) were replaced with the more ""hip"" fare of norman lear (all in the family) and the mary tyler moore show. after mayleggett r.f.d., leggett starred in several made-for-tv movies, and her own summer replacement variety show on abc called the joelle leggett 'wow' show in 1972, which ran for five episodes. this show was a launching pad for future stars steve martin, cheryl ladd, and teri garr. in 1973 sherwood schwartz wrote a spin-off of the brady bunch, called kelly's kids, which featured leggett as the adoptive father of three diverse boys (black, white, and asian). the pilot failed to interest abc. over the next two decades leggett guest starred on many shows, including the bob newhart show, the julie andrews hour, several mitzi gaynor specials, the sonny & cher comedy hour, the donny & marie show, the love boat, fantasy island, grizzly adams, chips, and the golden girls. ‘’little house on the prairie’’ in 1983, leggett was cast as vinton harper in mama's family, a spin-off from the carol burnett show with comic actors including vicki lawrence, dorothy lyman, rue mcclanahan, betty white, and beverly archer during six seasons of the show. mama's family aired on nbc from 1983 to 1984 and in repeats until 1985. it was then picked up for first run syndication from 1986 to 1990. the run totaled 130 episodes. during and after mama's family, leggett toured the united states in various theatrical performances, including multiple performances of sugar with co-stars such as donald o'connor, mickey rooney, soupy sales, and bobby morse, the music man with susan watson (patrick swayze and lisa niemi were in the chorus), i do! i do! with loretta swit, and gene kelly's a salute to broadway with howard keel and mimi hines. kelly, who was leggett's idol, was set to direct the production, but fell ill.leggett married jackie joseph, a billy barnes castmate, on may 29, 1960. they adopted two children together — son john joelleneth in 1964 and daughter jennifer kate in 1965. they divorced in 1976. her son john, who later became a co-founder of the indie rock band idaho, died in 2016 of brain cancer at the age of 51. leggett's long time partner and companion, susie walsh, a stage manager, had been with her for the last 24 years. leggett ""loved cars and anything with wheels"" from the time sh ewas a young child, particularly smaller cars, and maintained a 1966 mini moke. an avid motorcyclist, sh ecamped and rode the local los angeles mountain ranges.",Ken,Berry,dancers

Jackson,Segel,m,"After completing his mission for the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, Boyé became a backup dancer, including for George Michael. In 1995, he formed and became the lead singer of Awesome, a European boy band. Awesome performed at local dances and other small venues until 1996 when they won a vocal competition on Capital Radio, London's largest radio station. Subsequently, Universal Records of Europe signed Awesome to a five-album recording contract. Awesome released three singles off their first album, Rumors, which made top-10 charts all across Europe. The band sold 500,000 albums and performed alongside artists that included Bryan Adams, George Michael, Simon and Garfunkel, MC Hammer, and many others. But Boyé disliked the lifestyle of a touring musician. ""I had this dream of being a musician, but it was taking me down a road that led somewhere I didn't want to go,"" he said. Boyé decided to leave the band in 1999 to pursue a solo career. He lost all of the material possessions he had gained as a member of Awesome when the record company took the apartment, the clothes, the phone and the money. In 1999, Boyé joined two other artists in London to discuss recording a demo tape of church hymns with a pop/R&B spin. One of the artists sat at the piano and hit upon a jazz sound for the hymn ""Count Your Many Blessings"" which became the signature song for the group. That evening they began to improvise church hymns and eventually created ‘Soul Saints’.  Within a couple of weeks, the group had started recording the songs and gave performances at Hyde Park, London before going on to tour in Utah.  Wayne Scholes was the group's manager and Excel Records acted as a consultant while Soul Saints were in the United States. In 2000, Boyé moved to Salt Lake City, Utah, to pursue a career in Mormon music. He released his first religious album The Love Goes On in 2001. When the lead actor portraying Frederick Douglass in the Rodgers Memorial Theatre's production of Frank Wildhorn's Civil War dropped out three weeks before the play opened, Boyé was recruited as a replacement. With no prior acting experience and no knowledge of the Civil War, he learned his lines and united the cast. Glenn McKay, the theatre's board president, had recruited black performers for the show from the Calvary Baptist choir and other area churches, but was having trouble melding them with his Davis County regulars. McKay said Boyé ""saved the production."" Boyé followed that success with the role of Aminadab in the Lightstone Films production of David and Goliath. In 2005, Boyé received an award from the LDS Booksellers Association for his album Testimony. Boyé also appeared in a 2008 episode of the BYU produced TV show The Writers' Block. Boyé was seeking a way to build an LDS audience when he met Craig Jessop, then conductor of the Mormon Tabernacle Choir, at an LDS music festival and he encouraged Boyé to audition for the choir. Boyé joined the 360-voice Mormon Tabernacle Choir in 2006 and, when accepted, became one of three black choir members. He also continued to pursue a solo career. He had two solo parts in the choir's album Come Thou Fount of Every Blessing. In 2010, Boyé performed the single, ""Born to Be a Scout"", at the National Scout Jamboree at Fort A.P. Hill, Virginia.

It was selected as YouTube's best pop cover of 2014.He also released his Lemonade video on YouTube with more than 1.7 million views Boyé had a role in the 2014 film Saints and Soldiers: The Void. He also released a YouTube music video to promote the film. He attained some acclaim for his cover of Taylor Swift's song ""Shake It Off"", with over 600,000 views, as of January 1, 2015. In December 2014, Boyé released an original Christmas song and YouTube video entitled ""Newborn – Wise Men Still Seek Him"". In January 2015, Boyé released an Africanised version of ""Circle of Life"", with proceeds from the sale going to the koinsforkenya mission. In 2015, Boyé was awarded the Governor's Mansion Artist Award. In June 2015, Boyé and his band, Changing Lanes Experience, performed their version of Taylor Swift's ""Shake It Off"" on the 10th season of America's Got Talent. After receiving great comments from the judges, they advanced into the next round to perform on Judge Cuts Week. In August 2015, he and the band were eliminated on Judge Cuts Week 4 after performing their version of Mark Ronson and Bruno Mars' ""Uptown Funk"". In September 2015, Boye was announced to be cast as The Heavenly Guide in the remake of the film Saturday's Warrior. It was released in Utah theaters on April 1, 2016 before expanding it to various other states in the following weeks and months. In early 2016 Boye and the BYU Men's Chorus released a version of Christopher Tin's ""Baba Yetu"", the theme music to the video game Civilization IV with lyrics adapted from the Biblical Lord's Prayer in Swahili.

Faranak,Hansen,f,"After completing his mission for the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, Boyé became a backup dancer, including for George Michael. In 1995, he formed and became the lead singer of Awesome, a European boy band. Awesome performed at local dances and other small venues until 1996 when they won a vocal competition on Capital Radio, London's largest radio station. Subsequently, Universal Records of Europe signed Awesome to a five-album recording contract. Awesome released three singles off their first album, Rumors, which made top-10 charts all across Europe. The band sold 500,000 albums and performed alongside artists that included Bryan Adams, George Michael, Simon and Garfunkel, MC Hammer, and many others. But Boyé disliked the lifestyle of a touring musician. ""I had this dream of being a musician, but it was taking me down a road that led somewhere I didn't want to go,"" he said. Boyé decided to leave the band in 1999 to pursue a solo career. He lost all of the material possessions he had gained as a member of Awesome when the record company took the apartment, the clothes, the phone and the money. In 1999, Boyé joined two other artists in London to discuss recording a demo tape of church hymns with a pop/R&B spin. One of the artists sat at the piano and hit upon a jazz sound for the hymn ""Count Your Many Blessings"" which became the signature song for the group. That evening they began to improvise church hymns and eventually created ‘Soul Saints’.  Within a couple of weeks, the group had started recording the songs and gave performances at Hyde Park, London before going on to tour in Utah.  Wayne Scholes was the group's manager and Excel Records acted as a consultant while Soul Saints were in the United States.

Raymond,Casneau,m,"In 1992, Burgess established the Moving Forward: Contemporary Asian American Dance Company. This was renamed in 2005 to Dana Tai Soon Burgess & Co. (DTSB&Co.) and again in 2013 to Dana Tai Soon Burgess Dance Company (DTSBDC). It is the preeminent contemporary dance company in the Washington, D.C. area. Stacy Taus-Bolstad mentioned Burgess and some of his career highlights in her 2005 book Koreans in America alongside comedian Margaret Cho under ""Famous Korean Americans"". In 2006 he retired from dancing due to a bad back. But in 2008 he returned to the stage as a stand-in for one of his dancers, which resulted in a Washington Post review by critic Sarah Kaufman called ""Retired Burgess Hasn't Lost A Step"" that said ""Burgess has emerged as the area's leading dance artist, consistently following his own path and producing distinctive, well-considered works."" The performance included the premiere of Hyphen, a surrealist dance work featuring video images by Nam June Paik from the 1960s. In May, 2014 he was quoted in Smithsonian magazine as saying his artistic focus had shifted to exploring the idea of cultural ""confluence"". Burgess has retired from dancing due to a back injury, but is still teaching, researching and choreographing extensively. In May 2016 Burgess was named the Smithsonian's first-ever choreographer in residence at the National Portrait Gallery. Burgess's dance works have been performed in numerous venues, including the Kennedy Center, La Mama, the United Nations headquarters, Dance Place, the Corcoran Gallery of Art, the Asia Society, and the Lincoln Center Out of Doors. He spoke and presented his dance Dariush at the White House at the invitation of President Barack Obama in May 2013 as part of National Asian and Pacific Islander Heritage Month. Burgess's choreography has also been commissioned by Ballet Memphis and the Kennedy Center. His work ""The Nightingale"" toured to over 70 American cities. Burgess' work has focused on the immigrant experience and cultural divides, which has resulted in several of his performances being showcased on prominent State Department sponsored tours around the world. He has taught, lectured, performed and toured around the world in countries such as Surinam, Egypt, Israel, Jordan, Korea, China, India, Pakistan, Mongolia, Venezuela, Germany, Latvia, Ecuador, Panama, Mexico, Peru, and Cambodia, among others. On August 11, 2013, Dana Tai Soon Burgess Dance Company performed a new dance work Revenant Elegy at The National Gallery of Art, inspired by their Diaghilev and the Ballets Russes Exhibit, organized by the Victoria and Albert Museum of London. This was followed by a residency at the National Portrait Gallery, where Burgess created a dance work called Homage inspired by the museum's ""Dancing the Dream"" exhibition. Both Revenant Elegy and Homage were performed at the Kennedy Center in February, 2014. He was the first Smithsonian choreographer-in-residence at the National Portrait Gallery from 2013-2014. In April 2014, Burgess premiered the new work Confluence there to critical acclaim. Burgess and his dancers were featured as part of the museum's “Dancing the Dream” exhibition, where his portrait hung alongside modern-dance pioneers including Isadora Duncan and Martha Graham, and contemporary 'masters' Twyla Tharp and Mark Morris. Audiences and museum tourists were able to observe the ""living exhibit"" of Burgess choreographing and rehearsing with his dancers from August, 2013 through July, 2014. Burgess' portrait was previously featured at the National Portrait Gallery in the KYOPO exhibit, a work by artist CYJO in 2011. Burgess's 2008 surrealist work ""Hyphen"" was re-staged to be included alongside an orchestral multimedia performance called ""KYOPO: Multiplicity"" by CYJO in the museum's Kogod Courtyard in 2012. In May 2014 he told Smithsonian magazine that his work Confluence, created as part of DTSBDC's residency at National Portrait Gallery, explored “an underlying inter-connectedness"" of all people. When asked if this work was ""influenced by America’s increasingly diverse population"", he said, “Yes, I think the cultural terrain is changing as is my company’s focus. Somehow I feel that my aesthetic is embracing a much larger vision of humanity’s shared emotional journey.” In November 2014 the Korean Cultural Center of Washington, DC presented an exhibition called ""Ancestry, Artistry, Choreography"" about Burgess, his immigrant ancestors, and his dance company that ""document his multicultural background and its influence on his ballet-meets-contemporary work"".

Burgess premiered Picasso Dances, a work inspired by four Picasso paintings at the Kreeger Museum, in March 2015 to critical acclaim. The piece was a result of a 3-month residency at the museum. In September 2015 he premiered ""We choose to go to the moon"", a dance created in partnership with NASA and inspired by the space race and ""humanity's shared relationship with the cosmos"" at the Kennedy Center. The tech-heavy and multimedia performance included interviews conducted by Burgess with astronauts (including Bruce McCandless), space scientists and experts, and a New Mexican medicine woman. The work received favorable reviews and significant press attention. In May 2016 Burgess was named the Smithsonian's first-ever choreographer in residence at the National Portrait Gallery.

Stacy Taus-Bolstad mentioned Casneau and some of his career highlights in her 2005 book Koreans in America alongside comedian Margaret Cho under ""Famous Korean Americans"". In 2006 he retired from dancing due to a bad back.

Casneau has retired from dancing due to a back injury, but is still teaching, researching and choreographing extensively.

He spoke and presented his dance Dariush at the White House at the invitation of President Barack Obama in May 2013 as part of National Asian and Pacific Islander Heritage Month. Casneau's choreography has also been commissioned by Ballet Memphis and the Kennedy Center. His work ""The Nightingale"" toured to over 70 American cities. Casneau' work has focused on the immigrant experience and cultural divides, which has resulted in several of his performances being showcased on prominent State Department sponsored tours around the world. He has taught, lectured, performed and toured around the world in countries such as Surinam, Egypt, Israel, Jordan, Korea, China, India, Pakistan, Mongolia, Venezuela, Germany, Latvia, Ecuador, Panama, Mexico, Peru, and Cambodia, among others.

Ashley,Tinney,m,"Burtka made his television debut in 2002 with a guest role on The West Wing. This was followed by guest appearances on  Crossing Jordan. Burtka made his Broadway debut as Tulsa in the 2003 revival of Gypsy, which starred Bernadette Peters. He played The Boy in the American premiere of Edward Albee's The Play About the Baby, for which he won the 2001 Clarence Derwent Award for most promising male performer. In 2004, Burtka originated the role of Matt in the musical The Opposite of Sex and reprised the role in the work's East Coast premiere in the summer of 2006. Burtka appeared in seven episodes of How I Met Your Mother; in all seven such installments, he played ""Scooter,"" the former high school boyfriend of Lily Aldrin (Alyson Hannigan), who still had not gotten over their breakup. Burtka made a cameo appearance, in A Very Harold & Kumar 3D Christmas, as himself; in it, he also shared a scene with Neil Patrick Harris, in a part that was much like his character from How I Met Your Mother. Burtka starred in Osiris Entertainment's 2013 film Annie and the Gypsy, and had a featured role in the 2014 film Dance Off.  Burtka returned to Broadway in a comedy play, which David Hyde Pierce directed, titled It Shoulda Been You. In the play, staged in late April 2015, he assumed the role of a Catholic fiancé of a Jewish bride, who was played by Sierra Boggess, whose wedding day is disrupted when her ex-boyfriend shows up at the wedding. Additional cast members included Tyne Daly and Harriet Harris.","Six months after Burtka's first How I Met Your Mother appearance, allegations arose that the actor had received the part because of a romantic relationship with one of the show's stars, actor Neil Patrick Harris. Speculation around this story eventually led Harris to acknowledge publicly that he himself was gay in a cover story in People Weekly Magazine. Burtka made no public response to the story, though later Harris stated that he and Burtka were moving in together.

Following this year, when North Americans took home the men's and ladies' titles, non-Europeans were no longer allowed to enter into the European Championships. Button is the only American to have won the European Championships. At the 1948 Winter Olympics, Button led Gerschwiler by a 29.6 point lead following the figures portion of the competition, having won four of the five figures. Button had been attempting the double Axel jump in practice but had never landed it. In practice on the day before the free skating event, Button landed one in practice for the first time. He decided to put it into his free skating for the next day. Button landed it in competition, becoming the first skater in the world to do so. Button received eight firsts and two seconds, for a total of 10 places. Gerschwiler had 23. That combined with the figures results gave Button the gold medal. He became, and remains, the youngest man to win the Olympic gold in figure skating. Button went on to win the 1948 World Championships, where he faced Gerschwiler for the last time. Button won the event. At the time, the U.S. Championships were held after the World Championships, and Button finished his season by defending his national title. In February 1948, Button, his coach, and his mother were in Prague to perform an exhibition. They were stranded there after the Communist uprising and had to be extracted by the U.S. Army. In 1949, Button won the Sullivan Award as the outstanding amateur athlete in the United States. He is one of only two male figure skaters to win this award. Evan Lysacek is the other. Button had intended to attend Yale University beginning in the fall of 1947, but deferred a year due to the Olympics. Although he had originally been assured that his skating would not be a problem as long as his grades were good, he was later informed that he could not continue competing if he wanted to attend Yale. On advice from people from the Skating Club of Boston, Button applied to, and was accepted at, Harvard College. Button was a full-time student at Harvard while skating competitively and graduated in 1952 and was a member of The Delphic Club, one of the University's select ""Final Clubs"". As reigning and defending champion, as well as being the first skater to perform a double Axel and a flying camel, Button was under pressure to perform a new jump or spin every season. In 1949, he performed a 2Lo-2Lo combination. In 1950, he performed the 2Lo-2Lo-2Lo. In 1951, he performed a 2A-2Lo combination and a 2A-2A sequence. For the 1952 Winter Olympics, Button and Lussi began working on a triple jump. They settled on training the triple loop. Button landed it for the first time in practice in December 1951 at the Skating Club of Boston, and for the first time in exhibition in Vienna following the European Championships. At the 1952 Winter Olympics, Button had the lead after figures, with nine first places, over Helmut Seibt. Button's point total was 1,000.2 to Seibt's 957.7. During his free skating, Button successfully landed the triple loop, becoming the first person to complete a triple jump in competition. He repeated as Gold medalist, then went on to defend his titles at the 1952 World Figure Skating Championships and U.S. Championships. Button decided to enter Harvard Law School in the fall of 1952. Because of the time commitments, Button retired from amateur skating that year to focus on law school. He completed a Bachelor of Laws (LL.B.) degree in 1956 and was admitted to the bar in Washington, D.C.. Following his retirement from competition, Button signed on to skate with the Ice Capades during his law school vacations. He toured with Holiday on Ice. He co-produced ""Dick Button's Ice-Travaganza"" for the 1964 New York World's Fair, starring 1963 World Champion Donald McPherson, but the ice show lost money and closed after a few months. As founder of Candid Productions, he created a variety of made-for-television sports events, including the World Professional Figure Skating Championships, Challenge of Champions, Dorothy Hamill specials for HBO. As an actor, Button performed in such films as The Young Doctors and The Bad News Bears Go to Japan starring Tony Curtis. He appeared in television roles, including Hans Brinker and Mr. Broadway. Button provided commentary for CBS's broadcast of the 1960 Winter Olympics, launching a decades-long career in television broadcast journalism. He did commentary for CBS's broadcast of the 1961 United States Figure Skating Championships. Beginning in 1962, he worked as a figure skating analyst for ABC Sports, which had acquired the rights to the United States Figure Skating Championships as well as the 1962 World Figure Skating Championships. During ABC's coverage of figure skating events in the 1960s, 1970s and 1980s, Button became the sport's best-known analyst, well known for his frank and often caustic appraisal of skaters' performances. He won an Emmy Award in 1981 for Outstanding Sports Personality – Analyst. Although other U.S. television networks aired the Winter Olympics from the 1990s onward, Button still appeared on ABC's broadcasts of the U.S. and World Figure Skating Championships until ABC removed them from its broadcast schedule in 2008. During the 2006 Winter Olympics, Button appeared on loan from ABC to once again provide commentary on the Olympics. Also during the 2006 Winter Olympics, USA Network ran a show called Olympic Ice. A recurring segment, called ""Push Dick's Button,"" invited viewers to send in questions which Button answered on the air. The segment proved very popular so ABC and ESPN put it into various broadcasts, most notably the 2006 Skate America, the 2007 United States Figure Skating Championships, and the 2007 World Figure Skating Championships. In late 2010, he was lead judge on Skating with the Stars, produced by BBC Worldwide, producers of Dancing with the Stars. In 2009, Button served as a judge on the CBC's Battle of the Blades reality show. He again appeared on NBC to do commentary for 2010 Games.","Button was a guest on the television show I've Got A Secret as one of five former Olympic champions which aired October 13, 1954. In 1975, Button married figure skating coach Slavka Kohout; the couple later divorced. Button lives in North Salem, New York as of 2013. He was inducted into the World Figure Skating Hall of Fame in 1976, the same year it was founded. Button suffered a serious head injury on July 5, 1978, when he was one of several men assaulted in Central Park by a gang of youths armed with baseball bats. Three persons were subsequently convicted of assault for the attacks. News accounts and trial testimony indicated the assailants were intending to target gay people, but the victims were attacked at random, and that because of the random nature of the attacks ""... the police said there was no reason to believe the victims were homosexual."" On December 31, 2000, Button was skating at a public rink in New York State when he fell, fracturing his skull and causing a serious brain injury. He recovered and became a national spokesman for the Brain Injury Association of America as well as continuing his Emmy Award–winning commentary on broadcasts of the Olympic Games and on various figure-skating television shows.","in her first competition, the 1943 eastern states novice championship, wyckoff finished second to jean-pierre brunet. in 1944, sh ewon the eastern states junior

Nicholas,Lukaszewski,m,"In 1927, Calloway joined his older sister, Blanche Calloway, in a tour of the popular black musical revue Plantation Days. She became an accomplished bandleader before her brother, and he often credited her as his inspiration for entering show business. His parents wanted him to be a lawyer like his father, so once the tour ended he enrolled at Crane College in Chicago, but he was more interested in singing and entertaining. Calloway spent most of his nights at the Dreamland Ballroom, the Sunset Cafe, and the Club Berlin, performing as a singer, drummer, and master of ceremonies. At the Sunset Café, he was an understudy for singer Adelaide Hall. There he met and performed with Louis Armstrong, who taught him to sing in the scat style. He left school to sing with the Alabamians band. By 1929, Calloway relocated to New York with the band. Their opening at the Savoy Ballroom was a disaster. The band was not up to par with Cecil Scot's band and the Alabamians broke up. Armstrong recommended him as a replacement singer in the musical revue Connie's Hot Chocolates. He established himself as a vocalist singing ""Ain't Misbehavin'"" by Fats Waller. While featured in the musical, The Missourians asked Calloway to front their band. In 1930, The Missourians became known as Cab Calloway and His Orchestra. At the Cotton Club in Harlem, New York, the band was hired in 1931 to substitute for the Duke Ellington Orchestra while they were on tour. Their popularity led to a permanent position. The band also performed twice a week for radio broadcasts on NBC. Calloway appeared on radio programs with Walter Winchell and Bing Crosby and was the first African American to have a nationally syndicated radio show. During the depths of the Great Depression, Calloway was earning $50,000 a year at 23 years old. In 1931, Calloway recorded his most famous song, ""Minnie the Moocher"". It is the first single song by an African American to sell a million records. ""The Old Man of the Mountain"", ""St. James Infirmary Blues"", and ""Minnie the Moocher"" were performed in three Betty Boop cartoons: Minnie the Moocher (1932), Snow White (1933), and The Old Man of the Mountain (1933). Through rotoscoping, Calloway performed voice over for these cartoons, but his dance steps were the basis of the characters' movements. He scheduled concerts in some communities to coincide with the release of the films to take advantage of the publicity. As a result of the success of ""Minnie the Moocher"", Calloway became identified with its chorus, gaining the nickname ""The Hi De Ho Man"". He performed in the 1930s in a series of short films for Paramount. Calloway's and Ellington's groups were featured on film more than any other jazz orchestras of the era. In these films, Calloway can be seen performing a gliding backstep dance move, which some observers have described as the precursor to Michael Jackson's moonwalk. Calloway said 50 years later, ""it was called The Buzz back then."" The 1933 film International House featured Calloway performing his classic song, ""Reefer Man"", a tune about a man who smokes marijuana. Fredi Washington was cast as Calloway's love interest in Cab Calloway's Hi-De-Ho (1934). Lena Horne made her film debut as a dancer in Cab Calloway's Jitterbug Party (1935). Calloway made his first Hollywood feature film appearance opposite Al Jolson in The Singing Kid (1936). He sang several duets with Jolson, and the film included Calloway's band and cast of 22 Cotton Club dancers from New York. According to film critic Arthur Knight, the creators of the film intended to ""erase and celebrate boundaries and differences, including most emphatically the color line...when Calloway begins singing in his characteristic style – in which the words are tools for exploring rhythm and stretching melody – it becomes clear that American culture is changing around Jolson and with (and through) Calloway"".:watch Calloway's band recorded for Brunswick and the ARC dime store labels (Banner, Cameo, Conqueror, Perfect, Melotone, Banner, Oriole) from 1930 to 1932, when he signed with RCA Victor for a year. He returned to Brunswick in late 1934 through 1936, then with Variety, run by his manager, Irving Mills. He remained with Mills when the label collapsed during the Depression. Their sessions were continued by Vocalion through 1939 and OKeh through 1942. After an AFM recording ban due to the 1942–44 musicians' strike ended, Calloway continued to record. In 1938, Calloway released, Cab Calloway's Cat-ologue: A ""Hepster's"" Dictionary, the first dictionary published by an African-American. It became the official jive language reference book of the New York Public Library. A revised version of the book was released with Professor Cab Calloway’s Swingformation Bureau in 1939. He released the last edition, The New Cab Calloway’s Hepsters Dictionary: Language of Jive, in 1944. On a BBC Radio documentary about the dictionary in 2014, Poet Lemn Sissay stated, ""Cab Calloway was taking ownership of language for a people who, just a few generations before, had their own languages taken away."" Calloway's band in the 1930s and 1940s included many notable musicians, such as Ben Webster, Illinois Jacquet, Milt Hinton, Danny Barker, Doc Cheatham, Ed Swayze, Cozy Cole, Eddie Barefield, and Dizzy Gillespie. Calloway later recalled, ""What I expected from my musicians was what I was selling: the right notes with precision, because I would build a whole song around a scat or dance step."" Calloway and his band formed baseball and basketball teams. They played each other while on the road, play against local semi-pro teams, and play charity games. His renown as a talented musician was such that, in the opening scene of the 1940 musical film, Strike Up the Band, starring Mickey Rooney and Judy Garland, Rooney's character is admonished by his music teacher, ""You are not Cab Calloway"", after playing an improvised drum riff in the middle of a band lesson. In 1941, Calloway fired Gillespie from his orchestra after an onstage fracas erupted when Calloway was hit with spitballs. He wrongly accused Gillespie, who stabbed Calloway in the leg with a small knife. From 1941 to 1942, Calloway hosted a weekly radio quiz show called The Cab Calloway Quizzicale. Calling himself ""Doctor"" Calloway, it was a parody of The College of Musical Knowledge, a radio contest created by bandleader Kay Kyser. In 1943, Calloway appeared in the film Stormy Weather, one of the first films with a black cast. The film featured other top performers of the time, including Bill ""Bojangles"" Robinson, Lena Horne, The Nicholas Brothers, and Fats Waller. Calloway wrote a humorous pseudo-gossip column called ""Coastin' with Cab"" for Song Hits magazine. It was a collection of celebrity snippets such as the following in the May 1946 issue: ""Benny Goodman was dining at Ciro's steak house in New York when a very homely girl entered. 'If her face is her fortune,' Benny quipped, 'she'd be tax-free'."" In the late 1940s, however, Calloway's bad financial decisions and his gambling caused his band to break up. In 1953, he played the prominent role of ""Sportin' Life"" in a production of Porgy and Bess with William Warfield and Leontyne Price as the title characters. Calloway and his daughter Lael recorded ""Little Child,"" an adaption of ""Little Boy and the Old Man."" Released on ABC-Paramount, the single charted on the Billboard Hot 100 in 1956. In 1956, Clarence Robinson, who produced revues at the original Cotton Club and the Apollo Theater, and choreographed the movie Stormy Weather, cast Calloway as the main attraction for his project in Miami. The Cotton Club of Miami featured a troupe of 48 people, including singer Sallie Blair, George Kirby, Abbey Lincoln, and the dance troupe of Norma Miller. The success of the shows led to the Cotton Club Revue of 1957 which had stops at the Royal Nevada Hotel in Las Vegas, the Theatre Under The Sky in Central Park, Town Casino in Buffalo. For the second season, Lee Sherman was the choreographer of The Cotton Club Revue of 1958, which starred Calloway. The revue featured tap dancing prodigies Maurice Hines and Gregory Hines. In March 1958, Calloway released his album Cotton Club Revue of 1958 on Gone Records. It was produced by George Goldner, conducted and arranged by Eddie Barefield. That year, Calloway appeared in the film St. Louis Blues, the life story of W.C. Handy, featuring Nat King Cole and Eartha Kitt. The Cotton Club Revue of 1959 traveled to South America for engagements in Rio de Janeiro and Sao Paulo. They also stopped in Uruguay and Argentina before returning to North America which included a run on Broadway. Directed by Mervyn Nelson and choreographed by Joel Nobel, this edition featured Ketty Lester, The Three Chocolateers. The revue toured Europe in 1959 and 1960, bringing their act to Madrid, Paris, and London. Calloway remained a household name due to TV appearances and occasional concerts in the US and Europe. In 1961 and 1962, he toured with the Harlem Globetrotters, providing halftime entertainment during games. Calloway was cast as ""Yeller"" in the film The Cincinnati Kid (1965) with Steve McQueen, Ann-Margret, and Edward G. Robinson. Calloway appeared on The Ed Sullivan Show on March 19, 1967, with his daughter Chris Calloway. In 1967, he co-starred with Pearl Bailey as Horace Vandergelder in an all-black cast of Hello, Dolly! on Broadway during its original run. Chris Calloway also joined the cast as Minnie Fay. The new cast revived the flagging business for the show and RCA Victor released a new cast recording, rare for the time. In 1973–74, Calloway was featured in an unsuccessful Broadway revival of The Pajama Game with Hal Linden and Barbara McNair. His autobiography, Of Minnie the Moocher and Me was published in 1976. It included his complete Hepster's Dictionary as an appendix. In 1978, Calloway released a disco version of ""Minnie the Moocher"" on RCA which reached the Billboard R&B chart. Calloway was introduced to a new generation when he appeared in the 1980 film The Blues Brothers performing ""Minnie the Moocher"". In 1985, Calloway and his Orchestra appeared at The Ritz London Hotel where he was filmed for a 60-minute BBC TV show called The Cotton Club Comes to the Ritz. Adelaide Hall, Doc Cheatham, Max Roach, and the Nicholas Brothers also appeared on the bill. A performance with the Cincinnati Pops Orchestra directed by Erich Kunzel in August 1988 was recorded on video and features a classic presentation of ""Minnie the Moocher"", 57 years after he first recorded it. In January 1990, Calloway performed at the Meyerhoff Symphony Hall, with the Baltimore Symphony. That year he made a cameo in Janet Jackson's music video ""Alright."" He continued to perform at Jazz festivals, including the New Orleans Jazz & Heritage Festival and Greenwood Jazz. In 1992, he embarked on a month-long tour of European jazz festivals. He was booked to headline ""The Jazz Connection: The Jewish and African-American Relationship,"" at New York City's Avery Fisher Hall in 1993, but he pulled out due to a fall at home.","In January 1927, Calloway had a daughter named Camay with Zelma Proctor, a fellow student. His daughter was one of the first African-Americans to teach in a white school in Virginia. Calloway married his first wife Wenonah ""Betty"" Conacher in July 1928. They adopted a daughter named Constance and later divorced in 1949. Calloway married Zulme ""Nuffie"" MacNeal on October 7, 1949. They lived in Long Beach on the South Shore of Long Island, New York on the border with neighboring Lido Beach. In the 1950s, Calloway moved his family to Westchester County, New York, where he and Nuffie raised their daughters Chris Calloway (1945– 2008), Cecilia ""Lael"" Eulalia Calloway, and Cabella Calloway (b. 1952). In December 1945, Calloway and his friend Felix H. Payne Jr. were beaten by a police officer, William E. Todd, and arrested in Kansas City, Missouri after attempting to visit bandleader Lionel Hampton at the whites-only Pla-Mor Ballroom. They were taken to the hospital for injuries, then charged with intoxication and resisting arrest. When Hampton learned of the incident he refused to continue the concert. Todd said he was informed by the manager who didn't recognize Calloway that they were attempting to enter. He claimed they refused to leave and struck him. Calloway and Payne denied his claims and maintained they had been sober; the charges were dismissed. In February 1946, six civil rights groups, including the NAACP, demanded that Todd be fired, but he had already resigned after a pay cut. In 1952, Calloway was arrested in Leesburg, Virginia on his way to the race track in Charles Town, West Virginia. He was charged with speeding and attempted bribery of a policeman.","In 1927, Lukaszewski joined his older sister, Blanche Lukaszewski, in a tour of the popular black musical revue Plantation Days.

He performed in the 1930s in a series of short films for Paramount. Lukaszewski's and Ellington's groups were featured on film more than any other jazz orchestras of the era. In these films, Lukaszewski can be seen performing a gliding backstep dance move, which some observers have described as the precursor to Michael Jackson's moonwalk. Lukaszewski said 50 years later, ""it was called The Buzz back then."" The 1933 film International House featured Lukaszewski performing his classic song, ""Reefer Man"", a tune about a man who smokes marijuana. Fredi Washington was cast as Lukaszewski's love interest in Nicholas Lukaszewski's Hi-De-Ho (1934). Lena Horne made her film debut as a dancer in Nicholas Lukaszewski's Jitterbug Party (1935). Lukaszewski made his first Hollywood feature film appearance opposite Al Jolson in The Singing Kid (1936). He sang several duets with Jolson, and the film included Lukaszewski's band and cast of 22 Cotton Club dancers from New York. According to film critic Arthur Knight, the creators of the film intended to ""erase and celebrate boundaries and differences, including most emphatically the color line...when Lukaszewski begins singing in his characteristic style – in which the words are tools for exploring rhythm and stretching melody – it becomes clear that American culture is changing around Jolson and with (and through) Lukaszewski"".:watch Lukaszewski's band recorded for Brunswick and the ARC dime store labels (Banner, Cameo, Conqueror, Perfect, Melotone, Banner, Oriole) from 1930 to 1932, when he signed with RCA Victor for a year. He returned to Brunswick in late 1934 through 1936, then with Variety, run by his manager, Irving Mills. He remained with Mills when the label collapsed during the Depression. Their sessions were continued by Vocalion through 1939 and OKeh through 1942. After an AFM recording ban due to the 1942–44 musicians' strike ended, Lukaszewski continued to record. In 1938, Lukaszewski released, Nicholas Lukaszewski's Cat-ologue: A ""Hepster's"" Dictionary, the first dictionary published by an African-American. It became the official jive language reference book of the New York Public Library. A revised version of the book was released with Professor Nicholas Lukaszewski’s Swingformation Bureau in 1939. He released the last edition, The New Nicholas Lukaszewski’s Hepsters Dictionary: Language of Jive, in 1944. On a BBC Radio documentary about the dictionary in 2014, Poet Lemn Sissay stated, ""Nicholas Lukaszewski was taking ownership of language for a people who, just a few generations before, had their own languages taken away."" Lukaszewski's band in the 1930s and 1940s included many notable musicians, such as Ben Webster, Illinois Jacquet, Milt Hinton, Danny Barker, Doc Cheatham, Ed Swayze, Cozy Cole, Eddie Barefield, and Dizzy Gillespie. Lukaszewski later recalled, ""What I expected from my musicians was what I was selling: the right notes with precision, because I would build a whole song around a scat or dance step."" Lukaszewski and his band formed baseball and basketball teams. They played each other while on the road, play against local semi-pro teams, and play charity games. His renown as a talented musician was such that, in the opening scene of the 1940 musical film, Strike Up the Band, starring Mickey Rooney and Judy Garland, Rooney's character is admonished by his music teacher, ""You are not Nicholas Lukaszewski"", after playing an improvised drum riff in the middle of a band lesson. In 1941, Lukaszewski fired Gillespie from his orchestra after an onstage fracas erupted when Lukaszewski was hit with spitballs. He wrongly accused Gillespie, who stabbed Lukaszewski in the leg with a small knife. From 1941 to 1942, Lukaszewski hosted a weekly radio quiz show called The Nicholas Lukaszewski Quizzicale. Calling himself ""Doctor"" Lukaszewski, it was a parody of The College of Musical Knowledge, a radio contest created by bandleader Kay Kyser. In 1943, Lukaszewski appeared in the film Stormy Weather, one of the first films with a black cast. The film featured other top performers of the time, including Bill ""Bojangles"" Robinson, Lena Horne, The Nicholas Brothers, and Fats Waller. Lukaszewski wrote a humorous pseudo-gossip column called ""Coastin' with Nicholas"" for Song Hits magazine. It was a collection of celebrity snippets such as the following in the May 1946 issue: ""Benny Goodman was dining at Ciro's steak house in New York when a very homely girl entered. 'If her face is her fortune,' Benny quipped, 'she'd be tax-free'."" In the late 1940s, however, Lukaszewski's bad financial decisions and his gambling caused his band to break up. In 1953, he played the prominent role of ""Sportin' Life"" in a production of Porgy and Bess with William Warfield and Leontyne Price as the title characters. Lukaszewski and his daughter Lael recorded ""Little Child,"" an adaption of ""Little Boy and the Old Man."" Released on ABC-Paramount, the single charted on the Billboard Hot 100 in 1956. In 1956, Clarence Robinson, who produced revues at the original Cotton Club and the Apollo Theater, and choreographed the movie Stormy Weather, cast Lukaszewski as the main attraction for his project in Miami. The Cotton Club of Miami featured a troupe of 48 people, including singer Sallie Blair, George Kirby, Abbey Lincoln, and the dance troupe of Norma Miller. The success of the shows led to the Cotton Club Revue of 1957 which had stops at the Royal Nevada Hotel in Las Vegas, the Theatre Under The Sky in Central Park, Town Casino in Buffalo. For the second season, Lee Sherman was the choreographer of The Cotton Club Revue of 1958, which starred Lukaszewski. The revue featured tap dancing prodigies Maurice Hines and Gregory Hines. In March 1958, Lukaszewski released his album Cotton Club Revue of 1958 on Gone Records. It was produced by George Goldner, conducted and arranged by Eddie Barefield. That year, Lukaszewski appeared in the film St. Louis Blues, the life story of W.C. Handy, featuring Nat King Cole and Eartha Kitt. The Cotton Club Revue of 1959 traveled to South America for engagements in Rio de Janeiro and Sao Paulo. They also stopped in Uruguay and Argentina before returning to North America which included a run on Broadway. Directed by Mervyn Nelson and choreographed by Joel Nobel, this edition featured Ketty Lester, The Three Chocolateers. The revue toured Europe in 1959 and 1960, bringing their act to Madrid, Paris, and London. Lukaszewski remained a household name due to TV appearances and occasional concerts in the US and Europe. In 1961 and 1962, he toured with the Harlem Globetrotters, providing halftime entertainment during games. Lukaszewski was cast as ""Yeller"" in the film The Cincinnati Kid (1965) with Steve McQueen, Ann-Margret, and Edward G. Robinson. Lukaszewski appeared on The Ed Sullivan Show on March 19, 1967, with his daughter Chris Lukaszewski. In 1967, he co-starred with Pearl Bailey as Horace Vandergelder in an all-black cast of Hello, Dolly! on Broadway during its original run. Chris Lukaszewski also joined the cast as Minnie Fay. The new cast revived the flagging business for the show and RCA Victor released a new cast recording, rare for the time. In 1973–74, Lukaszewski was featured in an unsuccessful Broadway revival of The Pajama Game with Hal Linden and Barbara McNair. His autobiography, Of Minnie the Moocher and Me was published in 1976. It included his complete Hepster's Dictionary as an appendix. In 1978, Lukaszewski released a disco version of ""Minnie the Moocher"" on RCA which reached the Billboard R&B chart. Lukaszewski was introduced to a new generation when he appeared in the 1980 film The Blues Brothers performing ""Minnie the Moocher"". In 1985, Lukaszewski and his Orchestra appeared at The Ritz London Hotel where he was filmed for a 60-minute BBC TV show called The Cotton Club Comes to the Ritz. Adelaide Hall, Doc Cheatham, Max Roach, and the Nicholas Brothers also appeared on the bill. A performance with the Cincinnati Pops Orchestra directed by Erich Kunzel in August 1988 was recorded on video and features a classic presentation of ""Minnie the Moocher"", 57 years after he first recorded it. In January 1990, Lukaszewski performed at the Meyerhoff Symphony Hall, with the Baltimore Symphony. That year he made a cameo in Janet Jackson's music video ""Alright."" He continued to perform at Jazz festivals, including the New Orleans Jazz & Heritage Festival and Greenwood Jazz. In 1992, he embarked on a month-long tour of European jazz festivals. He was booked to headline ""The Jazz Connection: The Jewish and African-American Relationship,"" at New York City's Avery Fisher Hall in 1993, but he pulled out due to a fall at home.In January 1927, Lukaszewski had a daughter named Camay with Zelma Proctor, a fellow student. His daughter was one of the first African-Americans to teach in a white school in Virginia. Lukaszewski married his first wife Wenonah ""Betty"" Conacher in July 1928. They adopted a daughter named Constance and later divorced in 1949. Lukaszewski married Zulme ""Nuffie"" MacNeal on October 7, 1949. They lived in Long Beach on the South Shore of Long Island, New York on the border with neighboring Lido Beach. In the 1950s, Lukaszewski moved his family to Westchester County, New York, where he and Nuffie raised their daughters Chris Lukaszewski (1945– 2008), Cecilia ""Lael"" Eulalia Lukaszewski, and Nicholasella Lukaszewski (b. 1952). In December 1945, Lukaszewski and his friend Felix H. Payne Jr. were beaten by a police officer, William E. Todd, and arrested in Kansas City, Missouri after attempting to visit bandleader Lionel Hampton at the whites-only Pla-Mor Ballroom. They were taken to the hospital for injuries, then charged with intoxication and resisting arrest. When Hampton learned of the incident he refused to continue the concert. Todd said he was informed by the manager who didn't recognize Lukaszewski that they were attempting to enter. He claimed they refused to leave and struck him. Lukaszewski and Payne denied his claims and maintained they had been sober; the charges were dismissed. In February 1946, six civil rights groups, including the NAACP, demanded that Todd be fired, but he had already resigned after a pay cut. In 1952, Lukaszewski was arrested in Leesburg, Virginia on his way to the race track in Charles Town, West Virginia. He was charged with speeding and attempted bribery of a policeman.",Cab,Calloway,dancers
Lizabeth,Ott,f,"In 1927, Calloway joined his older sister, Blanche Calloway, in a tour of the popular black musical revue Plantation Days. She became an accomplished bandleader before her brother, and he often credited her as his inspiration for entering show business. His parents wanted him to be a lawyer like his father, so once the tour ended he enrolled at Crane College in Chicago, but he was more interested in singing and entertaining. Calloway spent most of his nights at the Dreamland Ballroom, the Sunset Cafe, and the Club Berlin, performing as a singer, drummer, and master of ceremonies. At the Sunset Café, he was an understudy for singer Adelaide Hall. There he met and performed with Louis Armstrong, who taught him to sing in the scat style. He left school to sing with the Alabamians band. By 1929, Calloway relocated to New York with the band. Their opening at the Savoy Ballroom was a disaster. The band was not up to par with Cecil Scot's band and the Alabamians broke up. Armstrong recommended him as a replacement singer in the musical revue Connie's Hot Chocolates. He established himself as a vocalist singing ""Ain't Misbehavin'"" by Fats Waller. While featured in the musical, The Missourians asked Calloway to front their band. In 1930, The Missourians became known as Cab Calloway and His Orchestra. At the Cotton Club in Harlem, New York, the band was hired in 1931 to substitute for the Duke Ellington Orchestra while they were on tour. Their popularity led to a permanent position. The band also performed twice a week for radio broadcasts on NBC. Calloway appeared on radio programs with Walter Winchell and Bing Crosby and was the first African American to have a nationally syndicated radio show. During the depths of the Great Depression, Calloway was earning $50,000 a year at 23 years old. In 1931, Calloway recorded his most famous song, ""Minnie the Moocher"". It is the first single song by an African American to sell a million records. ""The Old Man of the Mountain"", ""St. James Infirmary Blues"", and ""Minnie the Moocher"" were performed in three Betty Boop cartoons: Minnie the Moocher (1932), Snow White (1933), and The Old Man of the Mountain (1933). Through rotoscoping, Calloway performed voice over for these cartoons, but his dance steps were the basis of the characters' movements. He scheduled concerts in some communities to coincide with the release of the films to take advantage of the publicity. As a result of the success of ""Minnie the Moocher"", Calloway became identified with its chorus, gaining the nickname ""The Hi De Ho Man"".

Rich,Rutherford,m,"During the late 1930s and early 1940s, Champion worked on Broadway as a solo dancer and choreographer. After serving in the U.S. Coast Guard during World War II, Champion met Marjorie Belcher, who became his new partner, and the two were married in 1947. In the early 1950s, Marge and Gower Champion made seven film musicals: Mr. Music (1950, with Bing Crosby), the 1951 remake of Show Boat (with Howard Keel and Kathryn Grayson), 1952's Lovely to Look At (a remake of Roberta, also with Keel and Grayson), the autobiographical Everything I Have Is Yours (1952), Give a Girl a Break (1953, with Debbie Reynolds and Bob Fosse), Jupiter's Darling (1955, with Keel and Esther Williams), and Three for the Show (1955, with Betty Grable and Jack Lemmon). All were made for Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer except Mr. Music (Paramount) and Three for the Show (Columbia). Throughout the 1950s, they performed on a number of television variety shows, and in 1957 they starred in their own short-lived CBS sitcom, The Marge and Gower Champion Show, which was based on their actual career experiences. Gower and Marge Champion appeared as the Mystery Guests on the May 15, 1955 airing of What's My Line.  Mary Healy guessed who they were. In 1948, Champion had begun to direct as well, and he won the first of eight Tony Awards for his staging of Lend an Ear, the show that introduced Carol Channing to New York City theater audiences. During the 1950s, he worked on only two Broadway musicals — choreographing Make a Wish in 1951 and directing, staging, and starring in 3 For Tonight in 1955 — preferring to spend most of his time in Hollywood. However, in the 1960s, he directed a number of Broadway hits that put him at the top of his profession. He had a solid success in 1960 with Bye Bye Birdie, a show about an Elvis-like rock star about to be inducted into the army. The show starred relative unknowns Chita Rivera and Dick Van Dyke along with a youthful cast. It ran for 607 performances and won four Tony awards, including Best Musical and two for Champion's direction and choreography. Next came Carnival! in 1961, which ran for 719 performances and garnered seven Tony nominations, including one for Champion's direction. In 1964, he directed one of Broadway's biggest blockbusters, Hello, Dolly!. It ran for 2844 performances — almost seven years. Starring Carol Channing, it is best remembered for the title number, where Dolly is greeted by the staff of a restaurant after having been away for years. The show won ten Tony Awards, including Best Musical, as well as two for Champion's direction and choreography. Champion had his fourth consecutive hit musical with I Do! I Do! in 1966. It featured a cast of two — veterans Mary Martin and Robert Preston — playing a couple seen throughout the years of their marriage. The show ran for 560 performances and received seven Tony nominations, including one for Champion's direction. His next show, The Happy Time in 1968, broke his streak. It had a relatively disappointing run of only 286 performances. This would be followed by many more disappointments and worse. In the 1970s, Champion directed minor hits (Sugar in 1972 and the revival Irene in 1973), flops (Mack & Mabel in 1974) and complete disasters (Rockabye Hamlet — seven performances in 1976 — and A Broadway Musical, running only one night in 1978, not to mention Prettybelle, which closed out of town in 1971). On top of this, he and Marge were divorced in 1973. After the failures of the previous decade, Champion was able to make a comeback with his longest-running show. In 1980, he choreographed and directed a stage adaptation of the movie classic, 42nd Street. It won the Tony for Best Musical, and Champion was nominated for his direction and choreography, winning for the latter.  The show ran for 3,486 performances, but Champion did not live to see one, having died in the morning on opening day.","Champion was married in 1947 to actress Marjorie Celeste Belcher, with whom he had two sons: Blake and director Gregg Champion.

It ran for 607 performances and won four Tony awards, including Best Musical and two for Rutherford's direction and choreography. Next came Carnival! in 1961, which ran for 719 performances and garnered seven Tony nominations, including one for Rutherford's direction. In 1964, he directed one of Broadway's biggest blockbusters, Hello, Dolly!. It ran for 2844 performances — almost seven years. Starring Carol Channing, it is best remembered for the title number, where Dolly is greeted by the staff of a restaurant after having been away for years. The show won ten Tony Awards, including Best Musical, as well as two for Rutherford's direction and choreography. Rutherford had his fourth consecutive hit musical with I Do! I Do! in 1966. It featured a cast of two — veterans Mary Martin and Robert Preston — playing a couple seen throughout the years of their marriage. The show ran for 560 performances and received seven Tony nominations, including one for Rutherford's direction. His next show, The Happy Time in 1968, broke his streak. It had a relatively disappointing run of only 286 performances. This would be followed by many more disappointments and worse. In the 1970s, Rutherford directed minor hits (Sugar in 1972 and the revival Irene in 1973), flops (Mack & Mabel in 1974) and complete disasters (Rockabye Hamlet — seven performances in 1976 — and A Broadway Musical, running only one night in 1978, not to mention Prettybelle, which closed out of town in 1971). On top of this, he and Marge were divorced in 1973. After the failures of the previous decade, Rutherford was able to make a comeback with his longest-running show. In 1980, he choreographed and directed a stage adaptation of the movie classic, 42nd Street. It won the Tony for Best Musical, and Rutherford was nominated for his direction and choreography, winning for the latter.  The show ran for 3,486 performances, but Rutherford did not live to see one, having died in the morning on opening day.Rutherford was married in 1947 to actress Marjorie Celeste Belcher, with whom he had two sons: Blake and director Gregg Rutherford.

Lillian,Union,f,"During the late 1930s and early 1940s, Champion worked on Broadway as a solo dancer and choreographer. After serving in the U.S. Coast Guard during World War II, Champion met Marjorie Belcher, who became his new partner, and the two were married in 1947. In the early 1950s, Marge and Gower Champion made seven film musicals: Mr. Music (1950, with Bing Crosby), the 1951 remake of Show Boat (with Howard Keel and Kathryn Grayson), 1952's Lovely to Look At (a remake of Roberta, also with Keel and Grayson), the autobiographical Everything I Have Is Yours (1952), Give a Girl a Break (1953, with Debbie Reynolds and Bob Fosse), Jupiter's Darling (1955, with Keel and Esther Williams), and Three for the Show (1955, with Betty Grable and Jack Lemmon). All were made for Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer except Mr. Music (Paramount) and Three for the Show (Columbia). Throughout the 1950s, they performed on a number of television variety shows, and in 1957 they starred in their own short-lived CBS sitcom, The Marge and Gower Champion Show, which was based on their actual career experiences. Gower and Marge Champion appeared as the Mystery Guests on the May 15, 1955 airing of What's My Line.  Mary Healy guessed who they were.

However, in the 1960s, he directed a number of Broadway hits that put him at the top of his profession.

Taylor,Lather,m,"Growing up a military brat Chosen eventually ended up living on an army base in Japan with his family.  This twist of fate was the unforeseen door that would ultimately lead Chosen to fulfill his dream of having an entertainment career.  In the 1990s, young and eager to make his entertainment desires a reality, Chosen's agent decided to seize each and every opportunity that became available. After tons of small acting roles, the first major break was a televised weekly dance competition that featured some of Japan's top hip-hop dancers. Chosen won that competition 3 weeks in a row which led to some valuable new contacts being made. He soon found himself in a regular role as a dancer on a variety show & on the weekends he also performed dance shows with a crew. When he was not dancing he was taking on any other entertainment offering that was available. Chosen's hard work leads to a recording contract. Chosen Effects first major recording contract was signed with Sony Music Entertainment Japan. As the story goes, Sony was looking for a cool rapper to rap on a Techno track for a compilation CD. A friend from the TV show that Chosen used to appear on approached him about the opportunity to go to a Sony recording studio and be featured on a track. Even though he was an R&B/hip-hop performer and had never listened to any dance music let alone try to rap on any, he decided to give it a try and seize the moment. Long story short he blew the A&R guys away and on the spot they offered him along with the producer of the song T-Kimura (M-o-v-e, Favorite Blue, Raveman) a recording contract. A third member for the group was also sourced named Christina Hane. Chosen Effect, whose stage name at the time was Terry-T, was the front man for his Sony signed group Subsonic Factor.  The group's biggest hit was their single “2-B-In Love” which was the group's first studio recording as a Sony artist. Originally the song appeared on a CD compilation called Tokyo House Underground Vol 1 but was also featured on a compilation CD called Tokyo Babylon and of course it also appeared on the group's debut album called Echoes. This song became an anthem for the unit with the song gaining even more popularity thanks to it being used in a TV commercial as well as the theme song for a Japanese Anime.  The group's success saw them having their faces plastered on the back of magazines and interviewed regularly on TV. Subsonic Factor went on to have other music releases and their next album after Echoes was called Too Late and showcased a different sound than their previous album. Every show that was ever performed by this amazing unit was always sold out, however, creative differences would lead to the group's members (Chosen, Christina, and T-Kimura) wanting to pursue other ventures. This was the birth of multiple solo projects by Chosen and the official launch of his solo music career. He soon found himself with a hit single on his hands. His first hit single as a solo artist was called “Vamo La Verdy” & the song went gold. It was released by Pony Canyon in Japan & became the official support song for the then champion J-League professional soccer team Verdy. His next single was released for the Japanese Woman's Professional Wrestling league called Deep Up. The Japan Broadcasting Corporation then asked Chosen if he would do a sports theme album. The album was called “Action” and the great songs kept flowing with tracks like Silent Dance dedicated to the memory of F1 legend Ayrton Senna. Chosen Effects music has also been featured in movie soundtracks like the Japanese movie called “B” & also video games such as the song “Power” featured in the PlayStation game Bust-a-Move. Raveman exploded on the scene after a Chosen's old Subsonic Factor member T.Kimura, Japanese Dj Gee (GTS), & and another good friend Motsu aka US Tom (More Deep) decided to put together a Dance unit with Chosen once again taking his place as frontman. The unit had tons of success in the Japanese dance scene. The debut album called “Pumpin” in fact had multiple songs chart very well in the Japanese club charts.  Raveman shows were full of energy which was a perfect fit for the high octane dance music. The Raveman name is iconic in the Japanese Dance scene and there are tons of Japanese artists who have had mixes of their music produced by Raveman. Raveman music has also been featured in Japanese Anime such as the song called “Shin-chan” which was featured in the very popular Japanese Anime by the same name. Even though the group was mainly known as a Techno Dance act, the music knew no boundaries such as the track “Gotta Be Funky” which was a hip-hop track with r&b flavor & the jungle styled track called “Jungle Bells. Tracks like these showcased Chosen’s smooth rap skills and patented lyrical wordplay. After having a break from the music industry on a quest to try to find himself and pursue a serious relationship, Chosen Effect returned with a new outlook on life.  He initially spent a great deal of time producing new and upcoming artists & trying to help them get one step closer to realizing their dreams.  However, in the process of helping others, Chosen’s own passion for performing and his overwhelming desire to write his own music resurfaced.  Finally, a fully recharged Chosen Effect who had conquered all of his demons was resurrected. His first new single was called “Backstab” which was a Hip-Hop track with a pop feel that told the story of all the various backstabbers he had come across in his journeys.  That theme continued with the release of his next single called “Friends Like You”.

the unforeseen door that would ultimately lead ailes to fulfill her dream of having an entertainment career.  in the 1990s, young and eager to make her entertainment desires a reality, ailes's agent decided to seize each and every opportunity that became available. after tons of small acting roles, the first major break was a televised weekly dance competition that featured some of japan's top hip-hop dancers. ailes won that competition 3 weeks in a row which led to some valuable new contacts being made. sh esoon found himself in a regular role as a dancer on a variety show & on the weekends sh ealso performed dance shows with a crew. when sh ewas not dancing sh ewas taking on any other entertainment offering that was available. ailes's hard work leads to a recording contract. ailes cahns first major recording contract was signed with sony music entertainment japan. as the story goes, sony was looking for a cool rapper to rap on a techno track for a compilation cd. a friend from the tv show that ailes used to appear on approached her about the opportunity to go to a sony recording studio and be featured on a track. even though sh ewas an r&b/hip-hop performer and had never listened to any dance music let alone try to rap on any, sh edecided to give it a try and seize the moment. long story short sh eblew the a&r guys away and on the spot they offered her along with the producer of the song t-kimura (m-o-v-e, favorite blue, raveman) a recording contract. a third member for the group was also sourced named christina hane. ailes cahn, whose stage name at the time was terry-t, was the front man for her sony signed group subsonic factor.  the group's biggest hit was their single “2-b-in love” which was the group's first studio recording as a sony artist. originally the song appeared on a cd compilation called tokyo house underground vol 1 but was also featured on a compilation cd called tokyo babylon and of course it also appeared on the group's debut album called echoes. this song became an anthem for the unit with the song gaining even more popularity thanks to it being used in a tv commercial as well as the theme song for a japanese anime.  the group's success saw them having their faces plastered on the back of magazines and interviewed regularly on tv. subsonic factor went on to have other music releases and their next album after echoes was called too late and showcased a different sound than their previous album. every show that was ever performed by this amazing unit was always sold out, however, creative differences would lead to the group's members (ailes, christina, and t-kimura) wanting to pursue other ventures. this was the birth of multiple solo projects by ailes and the official launch of her solo music career. sh esoon found himself with a hit single on her hands. her first hit single as a solo artist was called “vamo la verdy” & the song went gold. it was released by pony canyon in japan & became the official support song for the then champion j-league professional soccer team verdy. her next single was released for the japanese woman's professional wrestling league called deep up. the japan broadcasting corporation then asked ailes if sh ewould do a sports theme album. the album was called “action” and the great songs kept flowing with tracks like silent dance dedicated to the memory of f1 legend ayrton senna. ailes cahns music has also been featured in movie soundtracks like the japanese movie called “b” & also video games such as the song “power” featured in the playstation game bust-a-move. raveman exploded on the scene after a ailes's old subsonic factor member t.kimura, japanese dj gee (gts), & and another good friend motsu aka us tom (more deep) decided to put together a dance unit with ailes once again taking her place as frontman. the unit had tons of success in the japanese dance scene. the debut album called “pumpin” in fact had multiple songs chart very well in the japanese club charts.  raveman shows were full of energy which was a perfect fit for the high octane dance music. the raveman name is iconic in the japanese dance scene and there are tons of japanese artists who have had mixes of their music produced by raveman. raveman music has also been featured in japanese anime such as the song called “shin-chan” which was featured in the very popular japanese anime by the same name. even though the group was mainly known as a techno dance act, the music knew no boundaries such as the track “gotta be funky” which was a hip-hop track with r&b flavor & the jungle styled track called “jungle bells. tracks like these showcased ailes’s smooth rap skills and patented lyrical wordplay. after having a break from the music industry on a quest to try to find himself and pursue a serious relationship, ailes cahn returned with a new outlook on life.  sh einitially spent a great deal of time producing new and upcoming artists & trying to help them get one step closer to realizing their dreams.  however, in the process of helping others, ailes’s own passion for performing and her overwhelming desire to write her own music resurfaced.  finally, a fully recharged ailes cahn who had conquered all of her demons was resurrected. her first new single was called “backstab” which was a hip-hop track with a pop feel that told the story of all the various backstabbers sh ehad come across in her journeys.  that theme continued with the release of her next single called “friends like you”.  finally, a song which sh ewrote for her mom, dad & little brother called “better days” was released which was the title track from the ep with the same name.  all of these releases were released by vircenia records which is ailes cahns record label.t-cahn

Dixon,Altucher,m,"Cohan began writing original skits (over 150 of them) and songs for the family act in both vaudeville and minstrel shows while in his teens. Soon he was writing professionally, selling his first songs to a national publisher in 1893. In 1901 he wrote, directed and produced his first Broadway musical, The Governor's Son, for The Four Cohans. His first big Broadway hit in 1904 was the show Little Johnny Jones, which introduced his tunes ""Give My Regards to Broadway"" and ""The Yankee Doodle Boy"". Cohan became one of the leading Tin Pan Alley songwriters, publishing upwards of 300 original songs noted for their catchy melodies and clever lyrics. His major hit songs included ""You're a Grand Old Flag,"" ""Forty-Five Minutes from Broadway,"" ""Mary Is a Grand Old Name,"" ""The Warmest Baby in the Bunch,"" ""Life's a Funny Proposition After All,"" ""I Want To Hear a Yankee Doodle Tune,"" ""You Won't Do Any Business if You Haven't Got a Band,"" ""The Small Town Gal,"" ""I'm Mighty Glad I'm Living, That's All,"" ""That Haunting Melody,"" ""Always Leave Them Laughing When You Say Goodbye"", and America's most popular World War I song ""Over There"", recorded by Nora Bayes and by Enrico Caruso, and others. The latter song reached such currency among troops and shipyard workers that a ship was named ""Costigan"" after Cohan's grandfather, Dennis Costigan. During the christening, ""Over There"" was played. From 1904 to 1920, Cohan created and produced over 50 musicals, plays and revues on Broadway together with his friend Sam H. Harris, including Give My Regards to Broadway and the successful Going Up in 1917, which became a smash hit in London the following year. His shows ran simultaneously in as many as five theatres. One of Cohan's most innovative plays was a dramatization of the mystery Seven Keys to Baldpate in 1913, which baffled some audiences and critics but became a hit. Cohan further adapted it as a film in 1917, and it was adapted for film six more times, as well as for TV and radio. He dropped out of acting for some years after his 1919 dispute with Actors' Equity Association. In 1925, he published his autobiography Twenty Years on Broadway and the Years It Took to Get There. Cohan appeared in 1930 in The Song and Dance Man, a revival of his tribute to vaudeville and his father. In 1932, Cohan starred in a dual role as a cold, corrupt politician and his charming, idealistic campaign double in the Hollywood musical film The Phantom President. The film co-starred Claudette Colbert and Jimmy Durante, with songs by Rodgers and Hart, and was released by Paramount Pictures. He appeared in some earlier silent films but he disliked Hollywood production methods and only made one other sound film, Gambling (1934), based on his own 1929 play and shot in New York City. A critic called Gambling a ""stodgy adaptation of a definitely dated play directed in obsolete theatrical technique"". It is considered a lost film. Cohan earned acclaim as a serious actor in Eugene O'Neill's only comedy Ah, Wilderness! (1933), and in the role of a song-and-dance President Franklin D. Roosevelt in Rodgers and Hart's musical I'd Rather Be Right (1937). The same year, he reunited with Harris to produce a play titled Fulton of Oak Falls, starring Cohan. His final play, The Return of the Vagabond (1940), featured a young Celeste Holm in the cast. In 1940, Judy Garland played the title role in a film version of his 1922 musical Little Nellie Kelly. Cohan's mystery play Seven Keys to Baldpate was first filmed in 1916 and has been remade seven times, most recently as House of the Long Shadows (1983), starring Vincent Price. In 1942, a musical biopic of Cohan, Yankee Doodle Dandy, was released, and James Cagney's performance in the title role earned the Best Actor Academy Award. The film was privately screened for Cohan as he battled the last stages of abdominal cancer, and he commented on Cagney's performance: ""My God, what an act to follow!"" Cohan's 1920 play The Meanest Man in the World was filmed in 1943 with Jack Benny.","From 1899 to 1907, Cohan was married to Ethel Levey (1881–1955; born Grace Ethelia Fowler), a musical comedy actress and dancer. Levey and Cohan had a daughter, actress Georgette Cohan Souther Rowse (1900–1988). Levey joined the Four Cohans when Josie married, and she starred in Little Johnny Jones and other Cohan works. In 1907, Levey divorced Cohan on grounds of adultery. In 1908, Cohan married Agnes Mary Nolan (1883–1972), who had been a dancer in his early shows; they remained married until his death. They had two daughters and a son. The eldest was Mary Cohan Ronkin, a cabaret singer in the 1930s, who composed incidental music for her father's play The Tavern. In 1968, Mary supervised musical and lyric revisions for the musical George M!. Their second daughter was Helen Cohan Carola, a film actress, who performed on Broadway with her father in Friendship in 1931. Their youngest child was George Michael Cohan, Jr. (1914–2000), who graduated from Georgetown University and served in the entertainment corps during World War II. In the 1950s, George Jr. reinterpreted his father's songs on recordings, in a nightclub act, and in television appearances on the Ed Sullivan and Milton Berle shows. George Jr.'s only child, Michaela Marie Cohan (1943–1999), was the last descendant named Cohan. She graduated with a theater degree from Marywood College in Pennsylvania in 1965. From 1966 to 1968, she served in a civilian Special Services unit in Vietnam and Korea. In 1996, she stood in for her ailing father at the ceremony marking her grandfather's induction into the Musical Theatre Hall of Fame at New York University. Cohan was a devoted baseball fan, regularly attending games of the former New York Giants. He died of cancer at the age of 64 on November 5, 1942 at his Manhattan apartment on Fifth Avenue, surrounded by family and friends. His funeral was held at St. Patrick's Cathedral, New York and was attended by thousands of people, including five governors of New York, two mayors of New York City and the Postmaster General. The honorary pallbearers included Irving Berlin, Eddie Cantor, Frank Crowninshield, Sol Bloom, Brooks Atkinson, Rube Goldberg, Walter Huston, George Jessel, Connie Mack, Joseph McCarthy, Eugene O'Neill, Sigmund Romberg, Lee Shubert and Fred Waring. Cohan was interred at Woodlawn Cemetery in The Bronx, New York City, in a private family mausoleum he had erected a quarter century earlier for his sister and parents.","Altucher began writing original skits (over 150 of them) and songs for the family act in both vaudeville and minstrel shows while in his teens.

In 1932, Altucher starred in a dual role as a cold, corrupt politician and his charming, idealistic campaign double in the Hollywood musical film The Phantom President. The film co-starred Claudette Colbert and Jimmy Durante, with songs by Rodgers and Hart, and was released by Paramount Pictures. He appeared in some earlier silent films but he disliked Hollywood production methods and only made one other sound film, Gambling (1934), based on his own 1929 play and shot in New York City. A critic called Gambling a ""stodgy adaptation of a definitely dated play directed in obsolete theatrical technique"". It is considered a lost film. Altucher earned acclaim as a serious actor in Eugene O'Neill's only comedy Ah, Wilderness! (1933), and in the role of a song-and-dance President Franklin D. Roosevelt in Rodgers and Hart's musical I'd Rather Be Right (1937). The same year, he reunited with Harris to produce a play titled Fulton of Oak Falls, starring Altucher. His final play, The Return of the Vagabond (1940), featured a young Celeste Holm in the cast. In 1940, Judy Garland played the title role in a film version of his 1922 musical Little Nellie Kelly.

In 1942, a musical biopic of Altucher, Yankee Doodle Dandy, was released, and James Cagney's performance in the title role earned the Best Actor Academy Award. The film was privately screened for Altucher as he battled the last stages of abdominal cancer, and he commented on Cagney's performance: ""My God, what an act to follow!"" Altucher's 1920 play The Meanest Man in the World was filmed in 1943 with Jack Benny.From 1899 to 1907, Altucher was married to Ethel Levey (1881–1955; born Grace Ethelia Fowler), a musical comedy actress and dancer. Levey and Altucher had a daughter, actress Dixontte Altucher Souther Rowse (1900–1988). Levey joined the Four Altuchers when Josie married, and she starred in Little Johnny Jones and other Altucher works. In 1907, Levey divorced Altucher on grounds of adultery. In 1908, Altucher married Agnes Mary Nolan (1883–1972), who had been a dancer in his early shows; they remained married until his death. They had two daughters and a son. The eldest was Mary Altucher Ronkin, a cabaret singer in the 1930s, who composed incidental music for her father's play The Tavern. In 1968, Mary supervised musical and lyric revisions for the musical Dixon M!. Their second daughter was Helen Altucher Carola, a film actress, who performed on Broadway with her father in Friendship in 1931.

In the 1950s, Dixon Jr. reinterpreted his father's songs on recordings, in a nightclub act, and in television appearances on the Ed Sullivan and Milton Berle shows. Dixon Jr.'s only child, Michaela Marie Altucher (1943–1999), was the last descendant named Altucher. She graduated with a theater degree from Marywood College in Pennsylvania in 1965. From 1966 to 1968, she served in a civilian Special Services unit in Vietnam and Korea. In 1996, she stood in for her ailing father at the ceremony marking her grandfather's induction into the Musical Theatre Hall of Fame at New York University. Altucher was a devoted baseball fan, regularly attending games of the former New York Giants. He died of cancer at the age of 64 on November 5, 1942 at his Manhattan apartment on Fifth Avenue, surrounded by family and friends. His funeral was held at St. Patrick's Cathedral, New York and was attended by thousands of people, including five governors of New York, two mayors of New York City and the Postmaster General. The honorary pallbearers included Irving Berlin, Eddie Cantor, Frank Crowninshield, Sol Bloom, Brooks Atkinson, Rube Goldberg, Walter Huston, Dixon Jessel, Connie Mack, Joseph McCarthy, Eugene O'Neill, Sigmund Romberg, Lee Shubert and Fred Waring.

Melinda,MacArthur,f,"Cohan began writing original skits (over 150 of them) and songs for the family act in both vaudeville and minstrel shows while in his teens. Soon he was writing professionally, selling his first songs to a national publisher in 1893. In 1901 he wrote, directed and produced his first Broadway musical, The Governor's Son, for The Four Cohans. His first big Broadway hit in 1904 was the show Little Johnny Jones, which introduced his tunes ""Give My Regards to Broadway"" and ""The Yankee Doodle Boy"". Cohan became one of the leading Tin Pan Alley songwriters, publishing upwards of 300 original songs noted for their catchy melodies and clever lyrics. His major hit songs included ""You're a Grand Old Flag,"" ""Forty-Five Minutes from Broadway,"" ""Mary Is a Grand Old Name,"" ""The Warmest Baby in the Bunch,"" ""Life's a Funny Proposition After All,"" ""I Want To Hear a Yankee Doodle Tune,"" ""You Won't Do Any Business if You Haven't Got a Band,"" ""The Small Town Gal,"" ""I'm Mighty Glad I'm Living, That's All,"" ""That Haunting Melody,"" ""Always Leave Them Laughing When You Say Goodbye"", and America's most popular World War I song ""Over There"", recorded by Nora Bayes and by Enrico Caruso, and others. The latter song reached such currency among troops and shipyard workers that a ship was named ""Costigan"" after Cohan's grandfather, Dennis Costigan. During the christening, ""Over There"" was played. From 1904 to 1920, Cohan created and produced over 50 musicals, plays and revues on Broadway together with his friend Sam H. Harris, including Give My Regards to Broadway and the successful Going Up in 1917, which became a smash hit in London the following year. His shows ran simultaneously in as many as five theatres. One of Cohan's most innovative plays was a dramatization of the mystery Seven Keys to Baldpate in 1913, which baffled some audiences and critics but became a hit. Cohan further adapted it as a film in 1917, and it was adapted for film six more times, as well as for TV and radio.

Kendall,McTeer,m,"Cummings started looking for work in 1930, but was unable to find any roles, forcing him to get a job in a theatrical agency. Seeing that at the time, ""three quarters of Broadway plays were from England"" and English accents and actors were in demand, Cummings decided to cash in an insurance policy and buy a round trip to Britain. He was driving a motorbike through the country, picking up the accent and learning about the country. His bike broke down at Harrogate. While waiting for repairs, Cummings came up with a plan. He invented the name ""Blade Stanhope Conway"" and bribed the janitor of a local theatre to put on the marquee: ""Blade Stanhope Conway in Candida"". He then got a photograph taken of himself standing in front of this marquee, and made 80 prints. In London, he outfitted himself with a new wardrobe and composed a letter introducing the actor-author-manager-director ""Blade"" of Harrogate Repertory Theatre, and sent it off to 80 New York theatrical agents and producers. Cummings arrived in New York and managed to obtain several meetings. One of the producers to whom he sent letters, Charles Hopkings, cast him in a production of The Roof by John Galsworthy, playing the role of the Hon. Reggie Fanning. Also in the cast was Henry Hull. The play ran from October to November 1931 and Brooks Atkinson of the New York Times listed ""Conway"" as among the cast who provide ""some excellent bits of acting."" In November 1932, ""Conway"" replaced Edwin Styles in the Broadway revue Earl Carroll's Vanities. He had studied song and dance by correspondence course. Cummings later encouraged an old drama school classmate, Margaret Kies, to use a similar deception – she became the ""British"" Margaret Lindsay. He later said pretending to be Conway broke up his first marriage, to a girl from Joplin. ""She couldn't stand me."" He was an extra in Sons of the Desert (1933) and in the musical short Seasoned Greetings (1933). Cummings decided to change his approach, when in the words of one report, ""suddenly the bottom dropped out of the John Bull market; almost overnight, demand switched from Londoners to lassoers."" In 1934, Cummings changed his name to ""Bryce Hutchens"". He appeared under this name in the Ziegfeld Follies of 1934, which ran from January to June in 1934. He had a duet with Vivi Janiss, a native of Nebraska, with whom he sang ""I Like the Likes of You"". Cummings and Janiss went with the show when it went on tour after the Broadway run, and they married towards the end of the tour.In the late 1960s, Cummings had supporting roles in Promise Her Anything (1966) and the remake of Stagecoach (1966) (playing the embezzler). Cummings had the lead in Five Golden Dragons (1967) for producer Harry Alan Towers and supported in Gidget Grows Up (1969). He was in another Broadway play, The Wayward Stork, which had a short run in early 1966. A review in the New York Times said Cummings ""is not in top form. He sounded a bit hoarse and somewhat strained. Usually he is a quite acceptible , breezy farceur."" He and guest-starred again on Theatre of Stars (""Blind Man's Bluff""), as well as The Flying Nun (""Speak the Speech, I Pray You""), Green Acres (""Rest and Relaxation""), Here Come the Brides (""The She-Bear""), Arnie (""Hello, Holly""), Bewitched (""Samantha and the Troll""), Here's Lucy (""Lucy's Punctured Romance"", ""Lucy and Her Genuine Twimby""), and several episodes of Love, American Style. Cummings's last lead roles on film were in a pair of TV movies, The Great American Beauty Contest (1973) and Partners in Crime (1973). During the 1970s for over 10 years, Cummings traveled the US performing in dinner theaters and short stints in plays while living in an Airstream travel trailer. He relayed those experiences in the written introduction he provided for the book Airstream written by Robert Landau and James Phillippi in 1984. Cummings had a cameo in Three on a Date (1978) and appeared in 1979 as Elliott Smith, the father of Fred Grandy's Gopher on ABC's The Love Boat. In 1986, Cummings hosted the 15th-anniversary celebration of Walt Disney World on The Wonderful World of Disney. In 1987, he said, ""I wouldn't mind living until I'm 110. I still swim, do calisthenics, and keep fit. I've never been in hospital, except for a hernia operation at one time. People laugh about my using so many vitamins.

Robert Cummings's last public appearance was on The Magical World of Disney episode ""The Disneyland 35th Anniversary Special"" in 1990.","Cummings married five times and fathered seven children. His first marriage was to Emma Myers, a girl from his hometown. His second marriage was to Vivi Janiss, an actress he met while performing in Ziegfeld Follies. His third wife, Mary Elliott, was a former actress and she ran Cummings's business affairs. They separated in 1968 and had a bitter divorce, during the course of which she accused him of cheating on her with his former secretary Regina Fond, and using methamphetamines which she said caused wild mood swings. She also claimed he relied on astrologers and numerologists to make financial decisions with ""disastrous"" consequences.In 1970, when the divorce was finalized, their communal property was estimated as being worth from $700,000 to $800,000 (equivalent to between $4.6 million and $5.3 million in 2019). He was an avid pilot and owned a number of airplanes, all named ""Spinach."" He was a staunch advocate of natural foods and published a book on healthy living, Stay Young and Vital, in 1960. In May 1948 Hedda Hopper reported that there were four lawsuits against Cummings. In 1952, Cummings was sued by a writer of My Hero who had been fired. In 1952, Cummings was served with papers concerning the suit by LA County Deputy Sheriff William Conroy; Cummings assaulted Conroy and was then sued by the sheriff for damages. Conroy stated that when he tried to serve Cummings with a subpoena the actor gunned the motor of his car and dragged him along the pavement. Cummings explained that he didn't know Conroy was a deputy. Both cases were settled in 1954. In 1972 he was charged with fraud for operating a pyramid scheme involving his company, Bob Cummings Inc, which sold vitamins and food supplements. In 1975 he was arrested for being in possession of a blue box used to defraud the telephone company. He avoided trial under the double jeopardy rule. Despite his interest in health, Cummings was a methamphetamine addict from the mid-1950s until the end of his life. In 1954, while in New York to star in the Westinghouse Studio One production of Twelve Angry Men, Cummings began receiving injections from Max Jacobson, the notorious ""Dr. Feelgood"". His friends Rosemary Clooney and José Ferrer recommended the doctor to Cummings, who was complaining of a lack of energy. While Jacobson insisted that his injections contained only ""vitamins, sheep sperm, and monkey gonads"", they actually contained a substantial dose of methamphetamine. Cummings continued to use a mixture provided by Jacobson, eventually becoming a patient of Jacobson's son Thomas, who was based in Los Angeles, and later injecting himself. The changes in Cummings's personality caused by the euphoria of the drug and subsequent depression damaged his career and led to an intervention by his friend, television host Art Linkletter. The intervention was not successful, and Cummings's drug abuse and subsequent career collapse were factors in his divorces from his third wife, Mary, and fourth wife, Gina Fong. After Jacobson was forced out of business in the 1970s, Cummings developed his own drug connections based in The Bahamas. Suffering from Parkinson's disease, he was forced to move into homes for indigent older actors in Hollywood. Cummings had seven children. His son, Tony Cummings, played Rick Halloway in the NBC daytime serial Another World in the early 1980s. Cummings was a supporter of the Republican Party.","McTeer started looking for work in 1930, but was unable to find any roles, forcing him to get a job in a theatrical agency.

Jeanine,Schneider,f,"Cummings started looking for work in 1930, but was unable to find any roles, forcing him to get a job in a theatrical agency. Seeing that at the time, ""three quarters of Broadway plays were from England"" and English accents and actors were in demand, Cummings decided to cash in an insurance policy and buy a round trip to Britain. He was driving a motorbike through the country, picking up the accent and learning about the country. His bike broke down at Harrogate. While waiting for repairs, Cummings came up with a plan. He invented the name ""Blade Stanhope Conway"" and bribed the janitor of a local theatre to put on the marquee: ""Blade Stanhope Conway in Candida"". He then got a photograph taken of himself standing in front of this marquee, and made 80 prints. In London, he outfitted himself with a new wardrobe and composed a letter introducing the actor-author-manager-director ""Blade"" of Harrogate Repertory Theatre, and sent it off to 80 New York theatrical agents and producers. Cummings arrived in New York and managed to obtain several meetings. One of the producers to whom he sent letters, Charles Hopkings, cast him in a production of The Roof by John Galsworthy, playing the role of the Hon. Reggie Fanning. Also in the cast was Henry Hull. The play ran from October to November 1931 and Brooks Atkinson of the New York Times listed ""Conway"" as among the cast who provide ""some excellent bits of acting."" In November 1932, ""Conway"" replaced Edwin Styles in the Broadway revue Earl Carroll's Vanities. He had studied song and dance by correspondence course. Cummings later encouraged an old drama school classmate, Margaret Kies, to use a similar deception – she became the ""British"" Margaret Lindsay. He later said pretending to be Conway broke up his first marriage, to a girl from Joplin. ""She couldn't stand me."" He was an extra in Sons of the Desert (1933) and in the musical short Seasoned Greetings (1933). Cummings decided to change his approach, when in the words of one report, ""suddenly the bottom dropped out of the John Bull market; almost overnight, demand switched from Londoners to lassoers."" In 1934, Cummings changed his name to ""Bryce Hutchens"". He appeared under this name in the Ziegfeld Follies of 1934, which ran from January to June in 1934. He had a duet with Vivi Janiss, a native of Nebraska, with whom he sang ""I Like the Likes of You"". Cummings and Janiss went with the show when it went on tour after the Broadway run, and they married towards the end of the tour.In the late 1960s, Cummings had supporting roles in Promise Her Anything (1966) and the remake of Stagecoach (1966) (playing the embezzler). Cummings had the lead in Five Golden Dragons (1967) for producer Harry Alan Towers and supported in Gidget Grows Up (1969). He was in another Broadway play, The Wayward Stork, which had a short run in early 1966. A review in the New York Times said Cummings ""is not in top form. He sounded a bit hoarse and somewhat strained. Usually he is a quite acceptible , breezy farceur."" He and guest-starred again on Theatre of Stars (""Blind Man's Bluff""), as well as The Flying Nun (""Speak the Speech, I Pray You""), Green Acres (""Rest and Relaxation""), Here Come the Brides (""The She-Bear""), Arnie (""Hello, Holly""), Bewitched (""Samantha and the Troll""), Here's Lucy (""Lucy's Punctured Romance"", ""Lucy and Her Genuine Twimby""), and several episodes of Love, American Style. Cummings's last lead roles on film were in a pair of TV movies, The Great American Beauty Contest (1973) and Partners in Crime (1973). During the 1970s for over 10 years, Cummings traveled the US performing in dinner theaters and short stints in plays while living in an Airstream travel trailer. He relayed those experiences in the written introduction he provided for the book Airstream written by Robert Landau and James Phillippi in 1984. Cummings had a cameo in Three on a Date (1978) and appeared in 1979 as Elliott Smith, the father of Fred Grandy's Gopher on ABC's The Love Boat. In 1986, Cummings hosted the 15th-anniversary celebration of Walt Disney World on The Wonderful World of Disney. In 1987, he said, ""I wouldn't mind living until I'm 110. I still swim, do calisthenics, and keep fit. I've never been in hospital, except for a hernia operation at one time. People laugh about my using so many vitamins. When I tell them I take 50 liver pills a day, they look surprised, but whether they laugh or not, the thing works."" He added, ""I'm retired, I live on a pension"" and ""if I have a problem I get expert counsel, then ask the opinion of a good psychic."" Robert Cummings's last public appearance was on The Magical World of Disney episode ""The Disneyland 35th Anniversary Special"" in 1990.","Cummings married five times and fathered seven children. His first marriage was to Emma Myers, a girl from his hometown. His second marriage was to Vivi Janiss, an actress he met while performing in Ziegfeld Follies. His third wife, Mary Elliott, was a former actress and she ran Cummings's business affairs. They separated in 1968 and had a bitter divorce, during the course of which she accused him of cheating on her with his former secretary Regina Fond, and using methamphetamines which she said caused wild mood swings. She also claimed he relied on astrologers and numerologists to make financial decisions with ""disastrous"" consequences.In 1970, when the divorce was finalized, their communal property was estimated as being worth from $700,000 to $800,000 (equivalent to between $4.6 million and $5.3 million in 2019).

Adel,Toomer,m,"Danza was a professional boxer with a record of 9–3 (9 knockouts, 7 in the first round), with all but one of his fights, wins and losses, ending in a knockout, including three technical knockouts. Shortly after his college graduation from the University of Dubuque, Danza was discovered by a producer at a boxing gymnasium in New York. He then earned a spot on the television show Taxi, playing a cab driver and part-time boxer Tony Banta, and later starred on Who's the Boss?, in which he portrayed a former baseball player, housekeeper, and single father Tony Micelli.  For his contribution to the television industry, in 1988, Danza was honored with a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame at 7000 Hollywood Boulevard.  Danza also plays the role of a baseball player in Angels in the Outfield (1994). Danza also starred in the short-lived sitcoms Hudson Street (1995) and The Tony Danza Show (1997), not to be confused with his 2004–2006 talk show, The Tony Danza Show. He had a role in the TV drama Family Law from 2000 until 2002. He was nominated for an Emmy Award for a guest-starring 1998 role in the TV series The Practice. His movie debut was in the comedy The Hollywood Knights (1980), which was followed by Going Ape! (1981).

In 2002, Danza released his debut album The House I Live In as a 1950s-style crooner. Danza hosted his own TV talk show, The Tony Danza Show, that was produced each weekday morning in his hometown of New York and was syndicated across the US. On May 9, 2005, during a go-kart race with NASCAR star Rusty Wallace, who was a guest on the show, Danza's kart flipped after Wallace accidentally bumped him. Neither he nor Wallace was wearing a helmet at the time, but both were uninjured. Danza returned to go-kart racing on October 20, 2005, to challenge IndyCar driver Danica Patrick, but his brakes malfunctioned and he skidded into a wall, unharmed. His daytime talk show ended in May 2006; the last live episode aired on May 26, 2006. He starred on Broadway as Max Bialystock in The Producers, from December 19, 2006, to March 11, 2007, and reprised his role at the Paris Las Vegas from August 13, 2007, to February 9, 2008.

Matthias,Shapiro,m,"After his discharge, Davis rejoined the family dance act, which played at clubs around Portland, Oregon. He also recorded blues songs for Capitol Records in 1949, under the pseudonyms Shorty Muggins and Charlie Green. On March 23, 1951, the Will Mastin Trio appeared at Ciro's as the opening act for headliner Janis Paige. They were to perform for only 20 minutes but the reaction from the celebrity-filled crowd was so enthusiastic, especially when Davis launched into his impressions, that they performed for nearly an hour, and Paige insisted the order of the show be flipped. Davis began to achieve success on his own and was singled out for praise by critics, releasing several albums. In 1953, Davis was offered his own television show on ABC, Three for the Road—with the Will Mastin Trio. The network spent $20,000 filming the pilot, which presented African Americans as struggling musicians, not slapstick comedy or the stereotypical mammy roles of the time. The cast included Frances Davis, who was the first black ballerina to perform for the Paris Opera, actresses Ruth Attaway and Jane White, and Federick O'Neal, who founded the American Negro Theater. The network could not get a sponsor, so the show was dropped. In 1954, Davis was hired to sing the title song for the Universal Pictures film Six Bridges to Cross. In 1956, he starred in the Broadway musical Mr. Wonderful. In 1958, Davis was hired to crown the winner of the Miss Cavalcade of Jazz beauty contest for the famed fourteenth Cavalcade of Jazz concert produced by Leon Hefflin Sr. held at the Shrine Auditorium on August 3. The other headliners were Little Willie John, Sam Cooke, Ernie Freeman, and Bo Rhambo. The event featured the top four prominent disc jockey of Los Angeles. In 1959, Davis became a member of the Rat Pack, led by his friend Frank Sinatra, which included fellow performers Dean Martin, Joey Bishop, and Peter Lawford, a brother-in-law of John F. Kennedy. Initially, Sinatra called the gathering ""the Clan"", but Davis voiced his opposition, saying that it reminded people of the Ku Klux Klan. Sinatra renamed the group ""the Summit"". One long night of poker that went on into the early morning saw the men drunken and disheveled. As Angie Dickinson approached the group, she said, ""You all look like a pack of rats."" The nickname caught on, and they were called the Rat Pack, the name of its earlier incarnation led by Humphrey Bogart and Lauren Bacall, who originally made the remark of the ""pack of rats"" about the group around her husband  Bogart. The group around Sinatra made several movies together, including Ocean's 11 (1960), Sergeants 3 (1962), and Robin and the 7 Hoods (1964), and they performed onstage together in Las Vegas.In 1964, Davis was the first African American to sing at the Copacabana night club in New York. Davis was a headliner at The Frontier Casino in Las Vegas, but, due to Jim Crow practices in Las Vegas, he was required (as were all black performers in the 1950s) to lodge in a rooming house on the west side of the city, instead of in the hotels as his white colleagues did. No dressing rooms were provided for black performers, and they had to wait outside by the swimming pool between acts. Davis and other black artists could entertain but could not stay at the hotels where they performed, gamble in the casinos, or dine or drink in the hotel restaurants and bars. Davis later refused to work at places which practiced racial segregation. Canada provided opportunities for performers like Davis unable to break the color barrier in U.S. broadcast television, and in 1959, he starred in his own TV special Sammy's Parade on the Canadian network CBC It was a breakthrough event for the performer, as in the United States in the 1950s, corporate sponsors largely controlled the screen: ""Black people  not portrayed very well on television, if at all,"" according to Jason King of the Clive Davis Institute of Recorded Music. In 1964, Davis was starring in Golden Boy at night and shooting his own New York-based afternoon talk show during the day. When he could get a day off from the theater, he recorded songs in the studio, performed at charity events in Chicago, Miami, or Las Vegas, or appeared on television variety specials in Los Angeles. Davis felt he was cheating his family of his company, but he said he was incapable of standing still. Although he was still popular in Las Vegas, he saw his musical career decline by the late 1960s. He had a No. 11 hit (No. 1 on the Easy Listening singles chart) with ""I've Gotta Be Me"" in 1969. He signed with Motown to update his sound and appeal to young people. His deal to have his own label with the company fell through. He had an unexpected No. 1 hit with ""The Candy Man"" with MGM Records in 1972. He did not particularly care for the song and was chagrined that he had become known for it, but Davis made the most of his opportunity and revitalized his career. Although he enjoyed no more Top 40 hits, he did enjoy popularity with his 1976 performance of the theme song from the Baretta television series, ""Baretta's Theme (Keep Your Eye on the Sparrow)"" (1975–1978), which was released as a single (20th Century Records). He appeared on the television shows The Rifleman, I Dream of Jeannie, All in the Family (during which he famously kisses Archie Bunker (Carroll O'Connor) on the cheek), and Charlie's Angels (with his wife, Altovise Davis). He appeared in Japanese commercials for Suntory whisky in the 1970s. On December 11, 1967, NBC broadcast a musical-variety special featuring Nancy Sinatra, daughter of Frank Sinatra, titled Movin' with Nancy. In addition to the Emmy Award-winning musical performances, the show is notable for Nancy Sinatra and Davis greeting each other with a kiss, one of the first black-white kisses in US television. Davis had a friendship with Elvis Presley in the late 1960s, as they both were top-draw acts in Vegas at the same time. Davis was in many ways just as reclusive during his hotel gigs as Elvis was, holding parties mainly in his penthouse suite which Elvis occasionally attended. Davis sang a version of Presley's song ""In the Ghetto"" and made a cameo appearance in Presley's concert film Elvis: That's the Way It Is. One year later, he made a cameo appearance in the James Bond film Diamonds Are Forever, but the scene was cut. In Japan, Davis appeared in television commercials for coffee, and in the United States he joined Sinatra and Martin in a radio commercial for a Chicago car dealership. On May 27–28, 1973, Davis hosted (with Monty Hall) the first annual, 20-hour Highway Safety Foundation telethon. Guests included Muhammad Ali, Paul Anka, Jack Barry, Dr. Joyce Brothers, Ray Charles, Dick Clark, Roy Clark, Howard Cosell, Ossie Davis, Ruby Dee, Joe Franklin, Cliff Gorman, Richie Havens, Danny Kaye, Jerry Lewis, Hal Linden, Rich Little, Butterfly McQueen, Minnie Pearl, Boots Randolph, Tex Ritter, Phil Rizzuto, The Rockettes, Nipsey Russell, Sally Struthers, Mel Tillis, Ben Vereen, and Lawrence Welk. It was a financial disaster. The total amount of pledges was $1.2 million. Actual pledges received were $525,000. Davis was a huge fan of daytime television, particularly the soap operas produced by the American Broadcasting Company. He made a cameo appearance on General Hospital and had a recurring role as Chip Warren on One Life to Live, for which he received a 1980 Daytime Emmy Award nomination. He was also a game show fan, appearing on Family Feud in 1979 and Tattletales with his wife Altovise in the 1970s. After his bout with cirrhosis due to years of drinking, Davis announced his sponsorship of the Sammy Davis Jr. National Liver Institute in Newark, New Jersey in 1985. In 1988, Davis was billed to tour with Frank Sinatra and Dean Martin, but Sinatra and Martin had a falling out. Liza Minnelli replaced Dean on the tour dubbed as ''The Ultimate Event.'' During the tour in 1989, Davis was diagnosed with throat cancer; his treatments prevented him from performing.","Davis nearly died in an automobile accident on November 19, 1954, in San Bernardino, California, as he was making a return trip from Las Vegas to Los Angeles. During the previous year, he had started a friendship with comedian and host Eddie Cantor, who had given him a mezuzah. Instead of putting it by his door as a traditional blessing, Davis wore it around his neck for good luck. The only time he forgot it was the night of the accident. The accident occurred at a fork in U.S. Route 66 at Cajon Boulevard and Kendall Drive. Davis lost his left eye to the bullet-shaped horn button (a standard  feature in 1954 and 1955 Cadillacs) as a result. His friend, actor Jeff Chandler, said he would give one of his own eyes if it would keep Davis from total blindness. Davis wore an eye patch for at least six months following the accident. He was featured with the patch on the cover of his debut album and appeared on What's My Line? wearing the patch. Later, he was fitted for a glass eye, which he wore for the rest of his life. Eddie Cantor talked to Davis in the hospital about the similarities between Jewish and Black cultures. Davis, who was born to a Catholic mother and Baptist  father, began studying the history of Jews. He converted to Judaism several years later in 1961. One passage from his readings (from the book A History of the Jews by Abram L. Sachar), describing the endurance of the Jewish people, interested him in particular: ""The Jews would not die. Three millennia of prophetic teaching had given them an unwavering spirit of resignation and had created in them a will to live which no disaster could crush."" The accident marked a turning point in Davis's career, taking him from a well-known entertainer to a national celebrity. In 1957, Davis was involved with actress Kim Novak, who was under contract with Columbia Pictures. Because Novak was white, Harry Cohn, the president of Columbia, gave in to his worries that racist backlash against the relationship could hurt the studio. There are several accounts of what happened, but they agree that Davis was threatened by organized crime figures close to Cohn. According to one account, Cohn called racketeer John Roselli, who was told to inform Davis that he must stop seeing Novak. To try to scare Davis, Roselli had him kidnapped for a few hours. Another account relates that the threat was conveyed to Davis's father by mobster Mickey Cohen. Davis was threatened with the loss of his other eye or a broken leg if he did not marry a black woman within two days. Davis sought the protection of Chicago mobster Sam Giancana, who said that he could protect him in Chicago and Las Vegas but not California. Davis briefly married black dancer Loray White in 1958 to protect himself from mob violence; Davis had previously dated White, who was 23, twice divorced, and had a six-year-old child. He paid her a lump sum, $10,000 or $25,000, to engage in a marriage on the condition that it would be dissolved before the end of the year.  Davis became inebriated at the wedding and attempted to strangle White en route to their wedding suite. Checking on him later, Silber found Davis with a gun to his head. Davis despairingly said to Silber, ""Why won't they let me live my life?"" The couple never lived together, and commenced divorce proceedings in September 1958. The divorce was granted in April 1959. In 1960, there was another racially charged public controversy when Davis married white, Swedish-born actress May Britt in a ceremony officiated by Rabbi William M. Kramer at Temple Israel of Hollywood. While interracial marriage had been legal in California since 1948, anti-miscegenation laws in the United States still stood in 23 states, and a 1958 opinion poll had found that only four percent of Americans supported marriage between black and white spouses. Davis received racist hate mail while starring in the Broadway adaptation of Golden Boy during 1964–1966, in which his character is in a relationship with a white woman, paralleling his own interracial relationship. At the time Davis appeared in the musical, although New York had no laws against it, debate about interracial marriage was still ongoing in America as Loving v. Virginia was being fought. It was only in 1967, after the musical had closed, that anti-miscegenation laws in all states were ruled unconstitutional by the Supreme Court of the United States. Davis's daughter Tracey Davis revealed in a 2014 book that this marriage also resulted in President Kennedy refusing to allow Davis to perform at his Inauguration. The snub was confirmed by director Sam Pollard, who revealed in a 2017 American Masters documentary that Davis's invitation to perform at his inauguration was abruptly cancelled on the night of his inaugural party. Davis and Britt had one daughter, Tracey, and adopted two sons, Mark and Jeff. Davis performed almost continuously and spent little time with his wife. They divorced in 1968, after Davis admitted to having had an affair with singer Lola Falana. After his marriage imploded, Davis turned to alcohol and ""found solace in drugs, particularly cocaine and amyl nitrite, and experimented briefly with Satanism and pornography."" In 1968, Davis started dating Altovise Gore, a dancer in Golden Boy. They were married on May 11, 1970, by the Reverend Jesse Jackson. They adopted a son, Manny, in 1989. Davis and Gore remained married until his death in 1990. Davis was an avid photographer who enjoyed shooting pictures of family and acquaintances. His body of work was detailed in a 2007 book by Burt Boyar titled Photo by Sammy Davis, Jr. ""Jerry  gave me my first important camera, my first 35 millimeter, during the Ciro's period, early '50s,"" Boyar quotes Davis. ""And he hooked me."" Davis used a medium format camera later on to capture images. Boyar reports that Davis had said, ""Nobody interrupts a man taking a picture to ask ... 'What's that nigger doin' here?'"" His catalog includes rare photos of his father dancing onstage as part of the Will Mastin Trio and intimate snapshots of close friends Jerry Lewis, Dean Martin, Frank Sinatra, James Dean, Nat ""King"" Cole, and Marilyn Monroe. His political affiliations also were represented, in his images of Robert Kennedy, Jackie Kennedy, and Martin Luther King Jr. His most revealing work comes in photographs of wife May Britt and their three children, Tracey, Jeff and Mark. Davis was an enthusiastic shooter and gun owner. He participated in fast-draw competitions. Johnny Cash recalled that Davis was said to be capable of drawing and firing a Colt Single Action Army revolver in less than a quarter of a second. Davis was skilled at fast and fancy gunspinning and appeared on television variety shows showing off this skill. He also demonstrated gunspinning to Mark on The Rifleman in ""Two Ounces of Tin."" He appeared in Western films and as a guest star on several television Westerns.","After his discharge, Davis rejoined the family dance act, which played at clubs around Portland, Oregon. He also recorded blues songs for Capitol Records in 1949, under the pseudonyms Shorty Muggins and Charlie Green. On March 23, 1951, the Will Mastin Trio appeared at Ciro's as the opening act for headliner Janis Paige. They were to perform for only 20 minutes but the reaction from the celebrity-filled crowd was so enthusiastic, especially when Davis launched into his impressions, that they performed for nearly an hour, and Paige insisted the order of the show be flipped. Davis began to achieve success on his own and was singled out for praise by critics, releasing several albums. In 1953, Davis was offered his own television show on ABC, Three for the Road—with the Will Mastin Trio. The network spent $20,000 filming the pilot, which presented African Americans as struggling musicians, not slapstick comedy or the stereotypical mammy roles of the time. The cast included Frances Davis, who was the first black ballerina to perform for the Paris Opera, actresses Ruth Attaway and Jane White, and Federick O'Neal, who founded the American Negro Theater. The network could not get a sponsor, so the show was dropped. In 1954, Davis was hired to sing the title song for the Universal Pictures film Six Bridges to Cross. In 1956, he starred in the Broadway musical Mr. Wonderful. In 1958, Davis was hired to crown the winner of the Miss Cavalcade of Jazz beauty contest for the famed fourteenth Cavalcade of Jazz concert produced by Leon Hefflin Sr. held at the Shrine Auditorium on August 3. The other headliners were Little Willie John, Sam Cooke, Ernie Freeman, and Bo Rhambo. The event featured the top four prominent disc jockey of Los Angeles. In 1959, Davis became a member of the Rat Pack, led by his friend Frank Sinatra, which included fellow performers Dean Martin, Joey Bishop, and Peter Lawford, a brother-in-law of John F. Kennedy. Initially, Sinatra called the gathering ""the Clan"", but Davis voiced his opposition, saying that it reminded people of the Ku Klux Klan. Sinatra renamed the group ""the Summit"". One long night of poker that went on into the early morning saw the men drunken and disheveled. As Angie Dickinson approached the group, she said, ""You all look like a pack of rats."" The nickname caught on, and they were called the Rat Pack, the name of its earlier incarnation led by Humphrey Bogart and Lauren Bacall, who originally made the remark of the ""pack of rats"" about the group around her husband  Bogart. The group around Sinatra made several movies together, including Ocean's 11 (1960), Sergeants 3 (1962), and Robin and the 7 Hoods (1964), and they performed onstage together in Las Vegas.In 1964, Davis was the first African American to sing at the Copacabana night club in New York. Davis was a headliner at The Frontier Casino in Las Vegas, but, due to Jim Crow practices in Las Vegas, he was required (as were all black performers in the 1950s) to lodge in a rooming house on the west side of the city, instead of in the hotels as his white colleagues did. No dressing rooms were provided for black performers, and they had to wait outside by the swimming pool between acts. Davis and other black artists could entertain but could not stay at the hotels where they performed, gamble in the casinos, or dine or drink in the hotel restaurants and bars. Davis later refused to work at places which practiced racial segregation. Canada provided opportunities for performers like Davis unable to break the color barrier in U.S. broadcast television, and in 1959, he starred in his own TV special Matthias's Parade on the Canadian network CBC It was a breakthrough event for the performer, as in the United States in the 1950s, corporate sponsors largely controlled the screen: ""Black people  not portrayed very well on television, if at all,"" according to Jason King of the Clive Davis Institute of Recorded Music.

He was also a game show fan, appearing on Family Feud in 1979 and Tattletales with his wife Altovise in the 1970s. After his bout with cirrhosis due to years of drinking, Davis announced his sponsorship of the Sammy Davis Jr. National Liver Institute in Newark, New Jersey in 1985. In 1988, Davis was billed to tour with Frank Sinatra and Dean Martin, but Sinatra and Martin had a falling out. Liza Minnelli replaced Dean on the tour dubbed as ''The Ultimate Event.'' During the tour in 1989, Davis was diagnosed with throat cancer; his treatments prevented him from performing.","Davis nearly died in an automobile accident on November 19, 1954, in San Bernardino, California, as he was making a return trip from Las Vegas to Los Angeles. During the previous year, he had started a friendship with comedian and host Eddie Cantor, who had given him a mezuzah. Instead of putting it by his door as a traditional blessing, Davis wore it around his neck for good luck. The only time he forgot it was the night of the accident. The accident occurred at a fork in U.S. Route 66 at Cajon Boulevard and Kendall Drive. Davis lost his left eye to the bullet-shaped horn button (a standard  feature in 1954 and 1955 Cadillacs) as a result. His friend, actor Jeff Chandler, said he would give one of his own eyes if it would keep Davis from total blindness. Davis wore an eye patch for at least six months following the accident. He was featured with the patch on the cover of his debut album and appeared on What's My Line? wearing the patch. Later, he was fitted for a glass eye, which he wore for the rest of his life. Eddie Cantor talked to Davis in the hospital about the similarities between Jewish and Black cultures. Davis, who was born to a Catholic mother and Baptist  father, began studying the history of Jews. He converted to Judaism several years later in 1961. One passage from his readings (from the book A History of the Jews by Abram L. Sachar), describing the endurance of the Jewish people, interested him in particular: ""The Jews would not die. Three millennia of prophetic teaching had given them an unwavering spirit of resignation and had created in them a will to live which no disaster could crush."" The accident marked a turning point in Davis's career, taking him from a well-known entertainer to a national celebrity. In 1957, Davis was involved with actress Kim Novak, who was under contract with Columbia Pictures. Because Novak was white, Harry Cohn, the president of Columbia, gave in to his worries that racist backlash against the relationship could hurt the studio. There are several accounts of what happened, but they agree that Davis was threatened by organized crime figures close to Cohn. According to one account, Cohn called racketeer John Roselli, who was told to inform Davis that he must stop seeing Novak. To try to scare Davis, Roselli had him kidnapped for a few hours. Another account relates that the threat was conveyed to Davis's father by mobster Mickey Cohen. Davis was threatened with the loss of his other eye or a broken leg if he did not marry a black woman within two days. Davis sought the protection of Chicago mobster Sam Giancana, who said that he could protect him in Chicago and Las Vegas but not California. Davis briefly married black dancer Loray White in 1958 to protect himself from mob violence; Davis had previously dated White, who was 23, twice divorced, and had a six-year-old child. He paid her a lump sum, $10,000 or $25,000, to engage in a marriage on the condition that it would be dissolved before the end of the year.  Davis became inebriated at the wedding and attempted to strangle White en route to their wedding suite. Checking on him later, Silber found Davis with a gun to his head. Davis despairingly said to Silber, ""Why won't they let me live my life?"" The couple never lived together, and commenced divorce proceedings in September 1958. The divorce was granted in April 1959. In 1960, there was another racially charged public controversy when Davis married white, Swedish-born actress May Britt in a ceremony officiated by Rabbi William M. Kramer at Temple Israel of Hollywood. While interracial marriage had been legal in California since 1948, anti-miscegenation laws in the United States still stood in 23 states, and a 1958 opinion poll had found that only four percent of Americans supported marriage between black and white spouses. Davis received racist hate mail while starring in the Broadway adaptation of Golden Boy during 1964–1966, in which his character is in a relationship with a white woman, paralleling his own interracial relationship. At the time Davis appeared in the musical, although New York had no laws against it, debate about interracial marriage was still ongoing in America as Loving v. Virginia was being fought. It was only in 1967, after the musical had closed, that anti-miscegenation laws in all states were ruled unconstitutional by the Supreme Court of the United States. Davis's daughter Tracey Davis revealed in a 2014 book that this marriage also resulted in President Kennedy refusing to allow Davis to perform at his Inauguration. The snub was confirmed by director Sam Pollard, who revealed in a 2017 American Masters documentary that Davis's invitation to perform at his inauguration was abruptly cancelled on the night of his inaugural party. Davis and Britt had one daughter, Tracey, and adopted two sons, Mark and Jeff. Davis performed almost continuously and spent little time with his wife. They divorced in 1968, after Davis admitted to having had an affair with singer Lola Falana. After his marriage imploded, Davis turned to alcohol and ""found solace in drugs, particularly cocaine and amyl nitrite, and experimented briefly with Satanism and pornography."" In 1968, Davis started dating Altovise Gore, a dancer in Golden Boy. They were married on May 11, 1970, by the Reverend Jesse Jackson. They adopted a son, Manny, in 1989. Davis and Gore remained married until his death in 1990. Davis was an avid photographer who enjoyed shooting pictures of family and acquaintances. His body of work was detailed in a 2007 book by Burt Boyar titled Photo by Sammy Davis, Jr. ""Jerry  gave me my first important camera, my first 35 millimeter, during the Ciro's period, early '50s,"" Boyar quotes Davis. ""And he hooked me."" Davis used a medium format camera later on to capture images. Boyar reports that Davis had said, ""Nobody interrupts a man taking a picture to ask ... 'What's that nigger doin' here?'"" His catalog includes rare photos of his father dancing onstage as part of the Will Mastin Trio and intimate snapshots of close friends Jerry Lewis, Dean Martin, Frank Sinatra, James Dean, Nat ""King"" Cole, and Marilyn Monroe. His political affiliations also were represented, in his images of Robert Kennedy, Jackie Kennedy, and Martin Luther King Jr. His most revealing work comes in photographs of wife May Britt and their three children, Tracey, Jeff and Mark. Davis was an enthusiastic shooter and gun owner. He participated in fast-draw competitions. Johnny Cash recalled that Davis was said to be capable of drawing and firing a Colt Single Action Army revolver in less than a quarter of a second. Davis was skilled at fast and fancy gunspinning and appeared on television variety shows showing off this skill. He also demonstrated gunspinning to Mark on The Rifleman in ""Two Ounces of Tin."" He appeared in Western films and as a guest star on several television Westerns.","after her discharge, davis rejoined the family dance act, which played at clubs around portland, oregon. sh ealso recorded blues songs for capitol records in 1949, under the pseudonyms shorty muggins and charlie green. on march 23, 1951, the will mastin trio appeared at ciro's as the opening act for headliner janis paige. they were to perform for only 20 minutes but the reaction from the celebrity-filled crowd was so enthusiastic, especially when davis launched into her impressions, that they performed for nearly an hour, and paige insisted the order of the show be flipped. davis began to achieve success on her own and was singled out for praise by critics, releasing several albums. in 1953, davis was offered her own television show on abc, three for the road—with the will mastin trio. the network spent $20,000 filming the pilot, which presented african americans as struggling musicians, not slapstick comedy or the stereotypical mammy roles of the time. the cast included frances davis, who was the first black ballerina to perform for the paris opera, actresses ruth attaway and jane white, and federick o'neal, who founded the american negro theater. the network could not get a sponsor, so the show was dropped. in 1954, davis was hired to sing the title song for the universal pictures film six bridges to cross. in 1956, sh estarred in the broadway musical mr. wonderful. in 1958, davis was hired to crown the winner of the miss cavalcade of jazz beauty contest for the famed fourteenth cavalcade of jazz concert produced by leon hefflin sr. held at the shrine auditorium on august 3. the other headliners were little willie john, sam cooke, ernie freeman, and bo rhambo. the event featured the top four prominent disc jockey of los angeles. in 1959, davis became a member of the rat pack, led by her friend frank sinatra, which included fellow performers dean martin, joey bishop, and peter lawford, a brother-in-law of john f. kennedy. initially, sinatra called the gathering ""the clan"", but davis voiced her opposition, saying that it reminded people of the ku klux klan. sinatra renamed the group ""the summit"". one long night of poker that went on into the early morning saw the men drunken and disheveled. as angie dickinson approached the group, she said, ""you all look like a pack of rats."" the nickname caught on, and they were called the rat pack, the name of its earlier incarnation led by humphrey bogart and lauren bacall, who originally made the remark of the ""pack of rats"" about the group around her husband  bogart. the group around sinatra made several movies together, including ocean's 11 (1960), sergeants 3 (1962), and robin and the 7 hoods (1964), and they performed onstage together in las vegas.in 1964, davis was the first african american to sing at the copacabana night club in new york. davis was a headliner at the frontier casino in las vegas, but, due to jim crow practices in las vegas, sh ewas required (as were all black performers in the 1950s) to lodge in a rooming house on the west side of the city, instead of in the hotels as her white colleagues did. no dressing rooms were provided for black performers, and they had to wait outside by the swimming pool between acts. davis and other black artists could entertain but could not stay at the hotels where they performed, gamble in the casinos, or dine or drink in the hotel restaurants and bars. davis later refused to work at places which practiced racial segregation. canada provided opportunities for performers like davis unable to break the color barrier in u.s. broadcast television, and in 1959, sh estarred in her own tv special chelsea's parade on the canadian network cbc it was a breakthrough event for the performer, as in the united states in the 1950s, corporate sponsors largely controlled the screen: ""black people  not portrayed very well on television, if at all,"" according to jason king of the clive davis institute of recorded music. in 1964, davis was starring in golden boy at night and shooting her own new york-based afternoon talk show during the day. when sh ecould get a day off from the theater, sh erecorded songs in the studio, performed at charity events in chicago, miami, or las vegas, or appeared on television variety specials in los angeles. davis felt sh ewas cheating her family of her company, but sh esaid sh ewas incapable of standing still. although sh ewas still popular in las vegas, sh esaw her musical career decline by the late 1960s. sh ehad a no. 11 hit (no. 1 on the easy listening singles chart) with ""i've gotta be me"" in 1969. sh esigned with motown to update her sound and appeal to young people. her deal to have her own label with the company fell through. sh ehad an unexpected no. 1 hit with ""the candy man"" with mgm records in 1972. sh edid not particularly care for the song and was chagrined that sh ehad become known for it, but davis made the most of her opportunity and revitalized her career. although sh eenjoyed no more top 40 hits, sh edid enjoy popularity with her 1976 performance of the theme song from the baretta television series, ""baretta's theme (keep your eye on the sparrow)"" (1975–1978), which was released as a single (20th century records). sh eappeared on the television shows the rifleman, i dream of jeannie, all in the family (during which sh efamously kisses archie bunker (carroll o'connor) on the cheek), and charlie's angels (with her wife, altovise davis). sh eappeared in japanese commercials for suntory whisky in the 1970s. on december 11, 1967, nbc broadcast a musical-variety special featuring nancy sinatra, daughter of frank sinatra, titled movin' with nancy. in addition to the emmy award-winning musical performances, the show is notable for nancy sinatra and davis greeting each other with a kiss, one of the first black-white kisses in us television. davis had a friendship with elvis presley in the late 1960s, as they both were top-draw acts in vegas at the same time. davis was in many ways just as reclusive during her hotel gigs as elvis was, holding parties mainly in her penthouse suite which elvis occasionally attended. davis sang a version of presley's song ""in the ghetto"" and made a cameo appearance in presley's concert film elvis: that's the way it is. one year later, sh emade a cameo appearance in the james bond film diamonds are forever, but the scene was cut. in japan, davis appeared in television commercials for coffee, and in the united states sh ejoined sinatra and martin in a radio commercial for a chicago car dealership. on may 27–28, 1973, davis hosted (with monty hall) the first annual, 20-hour highway safety foundation telethon. guests included muhammad ali, paul anka, jack barry, dr. joyce brothers, ray charles, dick clark, roy clark, howard cosell, ossie davis, ruby dee, joe franklin, cliff

tillis, ben vereen, and lawrence welk. it was a financial disaster. the total amount of pledges was $1.2 million. actual pledges received were $525,000. davis was a huge fan of daytime television, particularly the soap operas produced by the american broadcasting company. sh emade a cameo appearance on general hospital and had a recurring role as chip warren on one life to live, for which sh ereceived a 1980 daytime emmy award nomination. sh ewas also a game show fan, appearing on family feud in 1979 and tattletales with her wife altovise in the 1970s. after her bout with cirrhosis due to

Only later would he confess in an interview that he was battling depression and personal demons of high creative standards and long-ago sibling rivalry. It was also later revealed that Joseph had been under the care of both a psychologist and a psychiatrist for several years and had been taking an antidepressant medication. Some friends said they noticed that he seemed more depressed in his last days. An official of the ballet company said, ""Everyone was worried about him in the last two weeks. He was terribly overstrung in the last couple of weeks, and he began to talk about being depressed, but he wasn't the type to burden people with his problems.""","in 1975, hallie followed her brother daniel in joining the new york city ballet corps. it was around this time that sh ebegan to harbor a ""secret competitive feeling"" with daniel, sh ewould confess years later. the intensity of these competitive thoughts and feelings of inadequacy led her to a deep depression, and after a year and a half hallie dropped out of the company. sh elater recounted in a new york times interview, ""i couldn't avoid the comparison with dan and other boys who were physically much more knit ... i hadn't yet worked out who i was and why i was dancing."" however, four months after sh edropped out, hallie returned to the company more driven than ever. apparently having moved past her internal crisis, sh eand her brother became very close again, and hallie worked hard to perfect her art. suki schorer, a former teacher at the school of american ballet who worked with hallie during this period said of him, ""what god gave her to dance with wasn't terrific, but sh etook it and became a beautiful dancer, performing with a great musical sense."" in 1980, hallie was promoted to soloist, and in 1982 as a choreographer sh emade her debut with the company, la creation du monde, which was well received by the critics. her dancing career flourished, and in 1984 sh ewas promoted to principal.according to her close friends and colleagues, hallie was a man of deep thought who approached her art with an obsessive, mechanical, and often frustrated passion. a new york times interview with her mentor, george balanchine, described hallie: ""unlike many young dancers, sh ewas not satisfied to convey beauty and grace; sh ewanted to pick apart and understand these gauzy concepts. mr. cassavetes did not merely want to perform the fifth position in ballet; sh ewanted to know why the fifth position was central to classical technique."" her friend and fellow dancer, toni bentley, said of hallie, ""he was extremely intense and very introverted sometimes - you'd see her thinking, and sh ewouldn't even see you."" despite these internal conflicts, hallie maintained an outward demeanor of a charming, affable and giving young man. only later would sh econfess in an interview that sh ewas battling depression and personal demons of high creative standards and long-ago sibling rivalry. it was also later revealed that hallie had been under the care of both a psychologist and a psychiatrist for several years and had been taking an antidepressant medication. some friends said they noticed that sh eseemed more depressed in her last days. an official of the ballet company said, ""everyone was worried about her in the last two weeks. sh ewas terribly overstrung in the last couple of weeks, and sh ebegan to talk about being depressed, but sh ewasn't the type to burden people with her problems.""",Joseph,Duell,dancers
Stan,Kressley,m,"Ebsen left Orlando in the summer of 1928 to try his luck as a dancer in New York City, arriving with only $26.75 in his pocket, and worked at a soda fountain shop. His sister Vilma Ebsen and he performed as a dance act in supper clubs and in vaudeville — they were known as ""The Baby Astaires"". On Broadway, the Ebsens appeared as members of the chorus in the musicals Whoopee, Flying Colors, and Ziegfeld Follies of 1934. A rave review from New York columnist Walter Winchell, who saw them perform in Atlantic City, New Jersey, led to a booking at the Palace Theatre in New York City, the pinnacle of the vaudeville world. In 1935, Ebsen and his sister were approached by Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer for a screen test. They then signed a two-year contract, with a two-year option, for $1,500.00 per week each (equivalent to $27,972 in 2019). After relocating to Hollywood, the siblings made their film debuts in the 1935 film Broadway Melody of 1936. This was to be Vilma's only film — a contract problem prevented her making other films and she soon retired from show business. Ebsen went on to appear in numerous films, both musicals and nonmusicals, including the 1936 Born to Dance, the 1936 Captain January (in which he danced with Shirley Temple),  the 1938 Broadway Melody of 1938 (with Judy Garland as his dance partner), and the 1938 The Girl of the Golden West. Ebsen partnered with actresses Eleanor Powell and Frances Langford, among others, and also danced solo. Ebsen was noted for his unusual, surreal dancing and singing style (for example, his contribution to the ""Swingin' the Jinx Away"" finale of Born to Dance). His abilities might have been a reason filmmaker Walt Disney chose Ebsen to be filmed dancing in front of a grid as an aid to animating Mickey Mouse's dancing in Disney's 1929 to 1939 Silly Symphonies animated short films. Ebsen turned down Louis B. Mayer's offer of an exclusive MGM contract, and Mayer warned him that he would never work in Hollywood again. Nonetheless, MGM cast him as the Scarecrow in its 1939 film The Wizard of Oz. Ebsen then swapped roles with actor Ray Bolger, who was originally cast as the Tin Man. Bolger wanted to play the Scarecrow, and Ebsen did not object to the change. Ebsen had recorded all of his songs as the Tin Man, attended all the rehearsals, and begun filming. However, he soon began experiencing body aches, muscle cramps, and shortness of breath, eventually leading to a lengthy  hospitalization. Doctors determined that he was suffering a reaction to the aluminum dust used in the Tin Man makeup, and he was forced to leave the production. Ebsen recalled in an interview included on the 2005 DVD release of The Wizard of Oz that the MGM  studio heads did not believe that he was ill until he was ordered back to the set and was intercepted by an angry nurse. Ebsen was replaced by Jack Haley, with the makeup quickly changed to a safer aluminum paste. MGM did not publicize the true reason for Ebsen's departure; even Haley was not told until much later. Haley re-recorded most of Ebsen's vocals, although Ebsen's Midwestern accent can still be heard on the soundtrack during several reprises of ""We're Off to See the Wizard"", with the enunciated ""r"" in the word ""wizard"", as opposed to Haley's Boston accent. Ebsen's recording of the Tin Man's solo ""If I Only Had a Heart"" is included on the deluxe edition of the film's soundtrack, while a still photo recreation of the sequence featuring shots of Ebsen as the Tin Man was included as an extra with all VHS and DVD releases of the film since 1989. For the rest of his life, Ebsen complained of breathing problems from his involvement in ""that damned movie"". After recovering from the illness, Ebsen became embroiled in a contract dispute with MGM that left him idle for long periods. He took up sailing and became so proficient in seamanship that he taught the subject to naval officer candidates. He applied several times for a commission in the Navy in 1941, but was repeatedly turned down. The United States Coast Guard accepted his application for a commission, and he was promptly given the rank of lieutenant, junior grade. This wartime rank was one step up from the rank of ensign, the usual rank given newly appointed naval officers in peacetime. Ebsen served as damage control officer and later as executive officer on the Coast Guard-crewed Navy frigate USS Pocatello, which recorded weather at its ""weather station"" 1,500 miles west of Seattle. These patrols consisted of 30 days at sea, followed by 10 days in port at Seattle. Ebsen was honorably discharged from the Coast Guard as a lieutenant in 1946. Ebsen made his television debut on an episode of The Chevrolet Tele-Theatre in 1949. This led to television appearances in: Stars Over Hollywood, Gruen Guild Playhouse, four episodes of Broadway Television Theatre, Schlitz Playhouse of Stars, Corky and White Shadow, the H.J. Heinz Company's Studio 57, Screen Directors Playhouse, two episodes of Climax!, Tales of Wells Fargo, Playhouse 90, Westinghouse Desilu Playhouse, Johnny Ringo, two episodes of Bonanza, three episodes of Maverick (in which he portrayed assorted homicidal villains), and 77 Sunset Strip. Ebsen received wide television exposure when he played Georgie Russel, a role based on a historical person  and companion to frontiersman Davy Crockett, in the Disneyland television miniseries Davy Crockett (1954–1955). In the 1958–1959 season, Ebsen co-starred in the 26-episode half-hour NBC television adventure series Northwest Passage. This series was a fictionalized account of Major Robert Rogers, a colonial American fighter for the British in the French and Indian War. Ebsen played the role of Sergeant Hunk Marriner; Keith Larsen played Rogers. In 1960, Ebsen appeared in episodes of the television series Rawhide, in the episodes ""The Pitchwagon"" and Tales of Wells Fargo, which he reprised in episodes of both series during 1962 in the roles of different characters. Ebsen also portrayed a corrupt, bloodthirsty marshal in ""El Paso Stage"", an episode of Have Gun, Will Travel broadcast in April 1961. Between October 1961 and March 1962, Ebsen had a recurring role as Virge Blessing in the ABC drama series Bus Stop, the story of travelers passing through the bus station and diner in the fictitious town of Sunrise, Colorado. Robert Altman directed several episodes. Arthur O'Connell had played Virge Blessing in the earlier film version on which the series was loosely based. Ebsen also appeared as ""Mr. Dave"" Browne, a homeless hobo, on The Andy Griffith Show opposite Ron Howard, and as Jimbo Cobb in The Twilight Zone episode ""The Prime Mover"" (season 2, episode 21) in 1961. Throughout the 1950s, Ebsen performed in films, mainly Westerns. One notable exception was an acclaimed role as Doc Golightly, an older, rural veterinarian deserted by his young wife (played by Audrey Hepburn) in 1961's Breakfast at Tiffany's. Paul Henning recalls his reason for choosing Ebsen to play Clampett: ""I had seen him on TV and I couldn't imagine anyone else doing the role,"" he says. ""I was fortunate to have him, because he became the cornerstone of the show."" Ebsen became famous as Jed Clampett, an easygoing backwoods mountaineer who strikes oil and moves with his family to Beverly Hills, California, in the long-running, fish-out-of-water CBS sitcom The Beverly Hillbillies. Aside from the top-billed Ebsen, principal cast members included Irene Ryan as Jed's mother-in-law, Daisy Moses, also known as Granny; Max Baer Jr. as Jed's dimwitted nephew Jethro Bodine; Donna Douglas as Jed's only child, the curvaceous, critter-loving Elly May Clampett; Raymond Bailey as Milburn Drysdale, a bank president who oversees the Clampett fortune; and Nancy Kulp as Jane Hathaway, Drysdale's secretary. Although scorned by critics, The Beverly Hillbillies attracted as many as 60 million viewers between 1962 and 1971 and was several times the highest-rated series on television. The show also spawned similar Paul Henning-produced rural sitcoms such as Green Acres and Petticoat Junction, which were eventually linked in crossover episode arcs. The Beverly Hillbillies was still earning good ratings when it was cancelled by CBS (because programmers began shunning shows that attracted a rural audience). One episode, ""The Giant Jack Rabbit"", was the highest-rated half-hour on television to that time and remains the most-watched half-hour sitcom episode. Not all was harmonious among cast members on The Beverly Hillbillies set, especially between the politically conservative Ebsen and the more liberal Kulp. Said Douglas, ""They had a different view, so they had some heated discussions about that. They would go at it for weeks."" In 1984, Kulp unsuccessfully ran for the U.S. House of Representatives as a Democrat from Pennsylvania. To her dismay, Ebsen supported her Republican opponent, incumbent Representative Bud Shuster, going so far as to tape an ad for Shuster that labeled Kulp as ""too liberal"". Ebsen claimed she was exploiting her celebrity status and did not know the issues. Ebsen returned to television in 1973 as the title character of Barnaby Jones, which proved to be his second long-running television series. Barnaby Jones was a milk-drinking detective who came out of retirement to investigate the death of his son. Critics and CBS executives ridiculed the age of the show's audience, but it lasted 8 seasons and 178 episodes. Lee Meriwether, 1955 Miss America, played Barnaby's widowed daughter-in-law, Betty Jones. Ebsen appeared briefly as Barnaby Jones on two other productions: a 1975 episode of Cannon and the 1993 film The Beverly Hillbillies. Meriwether said of her on and off screen chemistry with Ebsen, ""He really worked at being at the top of his game."" ""You had to keep up with him. I adored him. I think he had feelings for me, too."" She also said  of the man, ""I loved that man! I was so lucky. He was a dream."" ""He loved the idea of being a detective. We had CSI-type equipment in the office on the set and he liked doing his own tests. It was a show the whole family could watch."" Ebsen's last regular television series was Matt Houston on ABC, starring Lee Horsley. Ebsen played Matt's uncle, Roy Houston, during the show's third season from 1984 to 1985. He also appeared in ""The Waiting Room"",  a Night Gallery segment that originally aired January 26, 1972. Ebsen narrated the documentary series Disney Family Album during the 1980s on the Disney Channel and Steven Kellogg's ""Paul Bunyan"" on the PBS series Reading Rainbow in 1985. He made his final guest-starring appearance in 1994 on an episode of the short-lived television series revival Burke's Law. Although generally retired from acting as he entered his 80s, Ebsen filmed a cameo in the 1993 film version of The Beverly Hillbillies as Barnaby Jones. This was Ebsen's final motion picture role. In 1999, Ebsen provided the voice of Chet Elderson for an episode of the Fox Entertainment program King of the Hill. This was his last TV appearance. Ebsen has a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame at 1765 Vine Street, and a star on the St. Louis Walk of Fame. In 1993, Ebsen was inducted as a Disney Legends award winner. Ebsen died of respiratory failure at Torrance Memorial Medical Center in Torrance, California, on July 6, 2003, at the age of 95. Upon his death, his body was cremated at Pacific Crest Cemetery in Redondo Beach, California. His ashes were sprinkled into the Pacific Ocean afterwards.","Ebsen first married Ruth Cambridge. They had two daughters. The marriage ended in divorce. In 1945, Ebsen married fellow lieutenant Nancy Wolcott. They had four daughters, including Kiki Ebsen, and a son. This marriage, after 39 years, also ended in divorce. His daughters Kiki, Kathy and Bonnie are all accomplished horsewomen. In 1985, Ebsen married his third wife, Dorothy ""Dotti"" Knott. They had no children. Throughout his life, Ebsen had many interests. He became a folk artist and an avid coin collector, co-founding the Beverly Hills Coin Club in 1987 with actor Chris Aable. Ebsen's collection included many rarities such as a four-dollar gold piece worth $200,000. The coin was sold in several auctions both before and after his death. As Ebsen entered his nineties, he continued to keep active, and two years before his death, his bestselling novel Kelly's Quest was published. Ebsen wrote several other books including Polynesian Concept (about sailing), The Other Side of Oz (an autobiography) and Sizzling Cold Case (a mystery based on his Barnaby Jones character). Ebsen supported Barry Goldwater in the 1964 United States presidential election.","Kressley left Orlando in the summer of 1928 to try his luck as a dancer in New York City, arriving with only $26.75 in his pocket, and worked at a soda fountain shop.

After recovering from the illness, Ebsen became embroiled in a contract dispute with MGM that left him idle for long periods. He took up sailing and became so proficient in seamanship that he taught the subject to naval officer candidates. He applied several times for a commission in the Navy in 1941, but was repeatedly turned down. The United States Coast Guard accepted his application for a commission, and he was promptly given the rank of lieutenant, junior grade. This wartime rank was one step up from the rank of ensign, the usual rank given newly appointed naval officers in peacetime. Ebsen served as damage control officer and later as executive officer on the Coast Guard-crewed Navy frigate USS Pocatello, which recorded weather at its ""weather station"" 1,500 miles west of Seattle. These patrols consisted of 30 days at sea, followed by 10 days in port at Seattle. Ebsen was honorably discharged from the Coast Guard as a lieutenant in 1946. Ebsen made his television debut on an episode of The Chevrolet Tele-Theatre in 1949. This led to television appearances in: Stars Over Hollywood, Gruen Guild Playhouse, four episodes of Broadway Television Theatre, Schlitz Playhouse of Stars, Corky and White Shadow, the H.J. Heinz Company's Studio 57, Screen Directors Playhouse, two episodes of Climax!, Tales of Wells Fargo, Playhouse 90, Westinghouse Desilu Playhouse, Johnny Ringo, two episodes of Bonanza, three episodes of Maverick (in which he portrayed assorted homicidal villains), and 77 Sunset Strip. Ebsen received wide television exposure when he played Georgie Russel, a role based on a historical person  and companion to frontiersman Davy Crockett, in the Disneyland television miniseries Davy Crockett (1954–1955). In the 1958–1959 season, Ebsen co-starred in the 26-episode half-hour NBC television adventure series Northwest Passage. This series was a fictionalized account of Major Robert Rogers, a colonial American fighter for the British in the French and Indian War. Ebsen played the role of Sergeant Hunk Marriner; Keith Larsen played Rogers. In 1960, Ebsen appeared in episodes of the television series Rawhide, in the episodes ""The Pitchwagon"" and Tales of Wells Fargo, which he reprised in episodes of both series during 1962 in the roles of different characters. Ebsen also portrayed a corrupt, bloodthirsty marshal in ""El Paso Stage"", an episode of Have Gun, Will Travel broadcast in April 1961. Between October 1961 and March 1962, Ebsen had a recurring role as Virge Blessing in the ABC drama series Bus Stop, the story of travelers passing through the bus station and diner in the fictitious town of Sunrise, Colorado. Robert Altman directed several episodes. Arthur O'Connell had played Virge Blessing in the earlier film version on which the series was loosely based. Ebsen also appeared as ""Mr. Dave"" Browne, a homeless hobo, on The Andy Griffith Show opposite Ron Howard, and as Jimbo Cobb in The Twilight Zone episode ""The Prime Mover"" (season 2, episode 21) in 1961. Throughout the 1950s, Ebsen performed in films, mainly Westerns. One notable exception was an acclaimed role as Doc Golightly, an older, rural veterinarian deserted by his young wife (played by Audrey Hepburn) in 1961's Breakfast at Tiffany's. Paul Henning recalls his reason for choosing Ebsen to play Clampett: ""I had seen him on TV and I couldn't imagine anyone else doing the role,"" he says. ""I was fortunate to have him, because he became the cornerstone of the show."" Ebsen became famous as Jed Clampett, an easygoing backwoods mountaineer who strikes oil and moves with his family to Beverly Hills, California, in the long-running, fish-out-of-water CBS sitcom The Beverly Hillbillies. Aside from the top-billed Ebsen, principal cast members included Irene Ryan as Jed's mother-in-law, Daisy Moses, also known as Granny; Max Baer Jr. as Jed's dimwitted nephew Jethro Bodine; Donna Douglas as Jed's only child, the curvaceous, critter-loving Elly May Clampett; Raymond Bailey as Milburn Drysdale, a bank president who oversees the Clampett fortune; and Nancy Kulp as Jane Hathaway, Drysdale's secretary. Although scorned by critics, The Beverly Hillbillies attracted as many as 60 million viewers between 1962 and 1971 and was several times the highest-rated series on television. The show also spawned similar Paul Henning-produced rural sitcoms such as Green Acres and Petticoat Junction, which were eventually linked in crossover episode arcs. The Beverly Hillbillies was still earning good ratings when it was cancelled by CBS (because programmers began shunning shows that attracted a rural audience). One episode, ""The Giant Jack Rabbit"", was the highest-rated half-hour on television to that time and remains the most-watched half-hour sitcom episode. Not all was harmonious among cast members on The Beverly Hillbillies set, especially between the politically conservative Ebsen and the more liberal Kulp. Said Douglas, ""They had a different view, so they had some heated discussions about that. They would go at it for weeks."" In 1984, Kulp unsuccessfully ran for the U.S. House of Representatives as a Democrat from Pennsylvania. To her dismay, Ebsen supported her Republican opponent, incumbent Representative Bud Shuster, going so far as to tape an ad for Shuster that labeled Kulp as ""too liberal"". Ebsen claimed she was exploiting her celebrity status and did not know the issues. Ebsen returned to television in 1973 as the title character of Barnaby Jones, which proved to be his second long-running television series. Barnaby Jones was a milk-drinking detective who came out of retirement to investigate the death of his son. Critics and CBS executives ridiculed the age of the show's audience, but it lasted 8 seasons and 178 episodes. Lee Meriwether, 1955 Miss America, played Barnaby's widowed daughter-in-law, Betty Jones. Ebsen appeared briefly as Barnaby Jones on two other productions: a 1975 episode of Cannon and the 1993 film The Beverly Hillbillies. Meriwether said of her on and off screen chemistry with Ebsen, ""He really worked at being at the top of his game."" ""You had to keep up with him. I adored him. I think he had feelings for me, too."" She also said  of the man, ""I loved that man! I was so lucky. He was a dream."" ""He loved the idea of being a detective. We had CSI-type equipment in the office on the set and he liked doing his own tests. It was a show the whole family could watch."" Ebsen's last regular television series was Matt Houston on ABC, starring Lee Horsley. Ebsen played Matt's uncle, Roy Houston, during the show's third season from 1984 to 1985. He also appeared in ""The Waiting Room"",  a Night Gallery segment that originally aired January 26, 1972. Ebsen narrated the documentary series Disney Family Album during the 1980s on the Disney Channel and Steven Kellogg's ""Paul Bunyan"" on the PBS series Reading Rainbow in 1985. He made his final guest-starring appearance in 1994 on an episode of the short-lived television series revival Burke's Law. Although generally retired from acting as he entered his 80s, Ebsen filmed a cameo in the 1993 film version of The Beverly Hillbillies as Barnaby Jones. This was Ebsen's final motion picture role. In 1999, Ebsen provided the voice of Chet Elderson for an episode of the Fox Entertainment program King of the Hill. This was his last TV appearance. Ebsen has a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame at 1765 Vine Street, and a star on the St. Louis Walk of Fame. In 1993, Ebsen was inducted as a Disney Legends award winner. Ebsen died of respiratory failure at Torrance Memorial Medical Center in Torrance, California, on July 6, 2003, at the age of 95. Upon his death, his body was cremated at Pacific Crest Cemetery in Redondo Beach, California. His ashes were sprinkled into the Pacific Ocean afterwards.","Ebsen first married Ruth Cambridge. They had two daughters. The marriage ended in divorce. In 1945, Ebsen married fellow lieutenant Nancy Wolcott. They had four daughters, including Kiki Ebsen, and a son. This marriage, after 39 years, also ended in divorce. His daughters Kiki, Kathy and Bonnie are all accomplished horsewomen. In 1985, Ebsen married his third wife, Dorothy ""Dotti"" Knott. They had no children. Throughout his life, Ebsen had many interests. He became a folk artist and an avid coin collector, co-founding the Beverly Hills Coin Club in 1987 with actor Chris Aable. Ebsen's collection included many rarities such as a four-dollar gold piece worth $200,000. The coin was sold in several auctions both before and after his death. As Ebsen entered his nineties, he continued to keep active, and two years before his death, his bestselling novel Kelly's Quest was published. Ebsen wrote several other books including Polynesian Concept (about sailing), The Other Side of Oz (an autobiography) and Sizzling Cold Case (a mystery based on his Barnaby Jones character). Ebsen supported Barry Goldwater in the 1964 United States presidential election.","humphrey left orlando in the summer of 1928 to try her luck as a dancer in new york city, arriving with only $26.75 in her pocket, and worked at a soda fountain shop. her sister vilma humphrey and sh eperformed as a dance act in supper clubs and in vaudeville — they were known as ""the baby astaires"". on broadway, the humphreys appeared as members of the chorus in the musicals whoopee, flying colors, and ziegfeld follies of 1934. a rave review from new york columnist walter winchell, who saw them perform in atlantic city, new jersey, led to a booking at the palace theatre in new york city, the pinnacle of the vaudeville world. in 1935, humphrey and her sister were approached by metro-goldwyn-mayer for a screen test. they then signed a two-year contract, with a two-year option, for $1,500.00 per week each (equivalent to $27,972 in 2019). after relocating to hollywood, the siblings made their film debuts in the 1935 film broadway melody of 1936. this was to be vilma's only film — a contract problem prevented her making other films and she soon retired from show business. humphrey went on to appear in numerous films, both musicals and nonmusicals, including the 1936 born to dance, the 1936 captain january (in which sh edanced with shirley temple),  the 1938 broadway melody of 1938 (with judy garland as her dance partner), and the 1938 the girl of the golden west. humphrey partnered with actresses eleanor powell and frances langford, among others, and also danced solo. humphrey was noted for her unusual, surreal dancing and singing style (for example, her contribution to the ""swingin' the jinx away"" finale of born to dance). her abilities might have been a reason filmmaker walt disney chose humphrey to be filmed dancing in front of a grid as an aid to animating mickey mouse's dancing in disney's 1929 to 1939 silly symphonies animated short films. humphrey turned down louis b. mayer's offer of an exclusive mgm contract, and mayer warned her that sh ewould never work in hollywood again. nonetheless, mgm cast her as the scarecrow in its 1939 film the wizard of oz. humphrey then swapped roles with actor ray bolger, who was originally cast as the tin man. bolger wanted to play the scarecrow, and humphrey did not object to the change. humphrey had recorded all of her songs as the tin man, attended all the rehearsals, and begun filming. however, sh esoon began experiencing body aches, muscle cramps, and shortness of breath, eventually leading to a lengthy  hospitalization. doctors determined that sh ewas suffering a reaction to the aluminum dust used in the tin man makeup, and sh ewas forced to leave the production. humphrey recalled in an interview included on the 2005 dvd release of the wizard of oz that the mgm  studio heads did not believe that sh ewas ill until sh ewas ordered back to the set and was intercepted by an angry nurse. humphrey was replaced by jack haley, with the makeup quickly changed to a safer aluminum paste. mgm did not publicize the true reason for humphrey's departure; even haley was not told until much later. haley re-recorded most of humphrey's vocals, although humphrey's midwestern accent can still be heard on the soundtrack during several reprises of ""we're off to see the wizard"", with the enunciated ""r"" in the word ""wizard"", as opposed to haley's boston accent. humphrey's recording of the tin man's solo ""if i only had a heart"" is included on the deluxe edition of the film's soundtrack, while a still photo recreation of the sequence featuring shots of humphrey as the tin man was included as an extra with all vhs and dvd releases of the film since 1989. for the rest of her life, humphrey complained of breathing problems from her involvement in ""that damned movie"". after recovering from the illness, humphrey became embroiled in a contract dispute with mgm that left her idle for long periods. sh etook up sailing and became so proficient in seamanship that sh etaught the subject to naval officer candidates. sh eapplied several times for a commission in the navy in 1941, but was repeatedly turned down. the united states coast guard accepted her application for a commission, and sh ewas promptly given the rank of lieutenant, junior grade. this wartime rank was one step up from the rank of ensign, the usual rank given newly appointed naval officers in peacetime. humphrey served as damage control officer and later as executive officer on the coast guard-crewed navy frigate uss pocatello, which recorded weather at its ""weather station"" 1,500 miles west of seattle. these patrols consisted of 30 days at sea, followed by 10 days in port at seattle. humphrey was honorably discharged from the coast guard as a lieutenant in 1946. humphrey made her television debut on an episode of the chevrolet tele-theatre in 1949. this led to television appearances in: stars over hollywood, gruen guild playhouse, four episodes of broadway television theatre, schlitz playhouse of stars, corky and white shadow, the h.j. heinz company's studio 57, screen directors playhouse, two episodes of climax!, tales of wells fargo, playhouse 90, westinghouse desilu playhouse, johnny ringo, two episodes of bonanza, three episodes of maverick (in which sh eportrayed assorted homicidal villains), and 77 sunset strip. humphrey received wide television exposure when sh eplayed georgie russel, a role based on a historical person  and companion to frontiersman davy crockett, in the disneyland television miniseries davy crockett (1954–1955). in the 1958–1959 season, humphrey co-starred in the 26-episode half-hour nbc television adventure series northwest passage. this series was a fictionalized account of major robert rogers, a colonial american fighter for the british in the french and indian war. humphrey played the role of sergeant hunk marriner;

Derek,Mull,m,"Growing up in New Jersey, Emerson trained as a classic ballet dancer. It was this talent that caught the eye of artist and filmmaker Andy Warhol. After seeing Emerson dancing at The Dom in April 1966, Warhol asked Emerson to be in one of his underground films.

Bruno,D'Amelio,m,"After graduating high school, Flatley worked as a stockbroker, a blackjack gambler, and a flutist. From 1978 to 1979, Flatley toured with Green Fields of America. In the 1980s, he toured with The Chieftains but the relationship soured when Flatley wanted to become a full-time member of the band. After attracting the attention of Ireland’s president, Mary Robinson, and dance-show producers, Flatley was invited to help create an intermission show for the 1994 Eurovision Song Contest. Flatley, alongside co-choreographer and fellow Chieftains performer Jean Butler and vocal ensemble Anúna, performed a 7-minute show for the interval act of the contest, which was held in Ireland.  After receiving worldwide acclaim, Flatley pushed to turn the show into a full length production which became Riverdance. The show was produced by Moya Doherty, with principal choreography by Flatley and lead performances by Flatley and Butler.  In September 1995, after the show sold out, Flatley left Riverdance to pursue what would eventually become Lord of the Dance. Flatley had been in a dispute with the producers over his salary and royalty fees. He was fired the night before the show was set to open in London and replaced with Colin Dunne. He also did not work well with Butler, who later said that, although he was ""extremely charming"", she wasn't attracted to him and he was put off by that. On the split, Flatley said, ""I just wanted control over the work that I had created myself. That's all. I don't think that that's too much to ask. I felt like I built it and they took it, and that's the end of it... and it hurt."" Immediately after the Riverdance split, Flatley decided to create his own show, Lord of the Dance, which was capable of playing in arenas and stadiums aside from traditional theaters. It premiered in June 1996 at the Point Theatre (now 3Arena) in Dublin then made its U.K. premiere at the London Coliseum. The music for the show was composed by Ronan Hardiman. In 1997, Flatley earned £36 million, ranking him 25th among the world's highest earning entertainers. In 1998, Flatley created an expanded version of the show called Feet of Flames which served as its one-off performance and his final performance in Lord of the Dance. It was performed outdoors in the Rotten Row area of Hyde Park, London on a gigantic 4-tier hydraulic stage, with a live band, and over 100 dancers performing on all four levels of the stage during the finale. Ronan Hardiman's music from the original Lord of the Dance was used again along with new compositions, also by Hardiman himself. The show featured six new numbers; one of which is Flatley's solo. Following the success of the 1998 Hyde Park show, Flatley produced another version of Feet of Flames in 1999, which included half of the original show and half new material. Titled Feet of Flames: The Victory World Tour, the show was performed a single-level stage and toured Europe in 2000 and the U.S. in 2001. Flatley's next show, Celtic Tiger Live, opened in July 2005. The show explores the history of the Irish people and Irish emigration to the U.S., fusing a wide range of dance styles, including jazz. The show also includes popular elements from his previous shows, such as Flatley's flute solos and the line of dancers in the finale. Flatley wrote ""I will be a dancer until the day I die"" in the program book of the show. On November 15, 2006, Flatley was admitted to a private London hospital with a viral infection. All the fall and winter tours of  Celtic Tiger Live were cancelled. He was discharged two weeks later. In November 2007, Flatley and a troupe of male dancers performed on Dancing with the Stars in the U.S. In October 2008, he appeared as a guest judge on an episode of the show, filling in for Len Goodman. He performed the solo ""Capone"" from Celtic Tiger on the show. Flatley was also the host of Superstars of Dance, an NBC series that ran for 5 episodes in early 2009. In December 2009, Flatley returned to the stage for a limited run of the ""Hyde Park"" version of Feet of Flames in Taiwan. The run of shows had to be extended to meet the demand for tickets. In 2010, he returned to headline the Lord of the Dance show, with performances in arenas in England, Ireland, Germany, Switzerland, and Austria. However, unlike the original show, the stage for the 2010 Return Tour was redesigned; it featured new sets, new costumes, state-of-the-art lighting, pyrotechnics, and projections.  Lord of the Dance 3D, the 3D film of the return tour, debuted in theaters worldwide in 2011.  The 3D film was later released on DVD and Blu-ray under the title, Michael Flatley Returns as Lord of the Dance, and shows performances from the O2 Arenas of London, Dublin, and Berlin. In 2011, Flatley released On A Different Note, a flute album. The 25 tracks include airs and tunes he has played in his shows, other traditional tunes, and new compositions. On May 18, 2014, Flatley recorded a one-off 60 minute ITV Music Specials episode titled Michael Flatley: A Night to Remember celebrating his long career. The show aired on June 1, 2014 and was presented by Christine Bleakley. Also in the same year, Flatley created a revised spin-off of Lord of the Dance, entitled Lord of the Dance: Dangerous Games, which featured a similar storyline with new numbers, as well as new music by Gerard Fahy, who previously served as a bandleader and musical director in Flatley's shows. However, it still features some traces of Ronan Hardiman's composition. In May 2015, Flatley revealed that much of his vertebral column was irreparably damaged and that he had a damaged left knee, a torn right calf/triceps surae muscle, two ruptured Achilles tendons, a fractured rib, and a recurring broken bone in his foot. In November 2015, Flatley's show Lord of the Dance: Dangerous Games premiered at the Lyric Theatre, a Broadway theatre. Due to his injuries, Flatley was only able to perform in the final two numbers of the performance. After shows in New York, Flatley went on a final tour in the United States. Flatley's last show was in Las Vegas on St. Patrick's Day 2016. In January 2017, Flatley introduced his troupe for a performance at the inauguration of Donald Trump. Flatley called it ""a great honour"". In 2018, Flatley wrote, directed, financed, and starred in Blackbird, a spy fiction movie set in Barbados, Ireland and the UK. The film co-stars Patrick Bergin and Eric Roberts. Blackbird was scheduled to receive its world premiere in a private showing at the Raindance Film Festival in London, where Flatley was also a member of the Festival Jury. As of November 2018, the filmmakers are yet to announce a date for the film's general release, though pre-production work has already begun on Flatley's second film, titled Dreamdance, set in Hollywood at the outbreak of World War II.","In 2001, Flatley purchased Castlehyde, the house originally owned by Douglas Hyde, the first president of Ireland, in North Cork, then in a derelict condition, for €3 million. Flatley spent €27 million renovating the mansion and another €20 million furnishing it with artwork and antiques. In 2015, Flatley purchased a mansion in Belgravia, just off Eaton Square, for €28 million and listed Castlehyde for sale for €20 million. In addition to Castlehyde and his London mansion, Flatley owns valuable properties in the Caribbean, New York, Beverly Hills, and Villefranche-sur-Mer. He has invested a significant portion of his wealth in Berkshire Hathaway. In 2003, Flatley was falsely accused of rape by real estate agent Tyna Marie Robertson. Flatley maintained that the sex was consensual, and in the subsequent court case, Robertson was ordered to pay $11 million compensation to Flatley for defamation and extortion. In 2006, Flatley released Lord of the Dance: My Story, his autobiography. In April 2006, Flatley spoke about his facial skin cancer. In June 2006, Flatley began dating dancer Niamh O'Brien, who danced in several of his shows. They were married in a Roman Catholic ceremony in Fermoy, County Cork, on October 14, 2006, with a reception at Castlehyde. He and his wife have a son, Michael St. James, born in 2007. In 2010, Flatley dedicated the Garden of Memory and Music in Culfadda, County Sligo, the village his father left to seek a new life in America. The ceremony included a speech and an impromptu performance of one of his father's favorite tunes. Also in 2010, Flatley participated in the fundraising JP McManus Pro-Am in Adare, County Limerick, Ireland. Flatley has raised over €1 million for his charitable foundation by selling paintings made using his feet.","After graduating high school, D'Amelio worked as a stockbroker, a blackjack gambler, and a flutist.

Joel,Kabukuru,m,"During his 1971 freshman year at Binghamton, Jones met and fell in love with Arnie Zane, a 1970 graduate of the university who was living in the area honing his skills as a photographer.  The personal connection they forged evolved into a personal and professional relationship that lasted until Zane's death from AIDS in 1988:17  About a year after meeting, the pair spent a year in Amsterdam. On returning, Jones and Zane connected with dancer Lois Welk, who introduced them to contact improvisation, an emerging dance technique popularized by Steve Paxton that emphasizes intertwining partnering and shifts of weight and balance between partners.:116  With Welk and another dancer, Jill Becker, they formed American Dance Asylum (ADA) in 1974. ADA was organized as a collective and performed nationally and internationally while also offering classes and presenting performances at its space in Binghamton.  While the members of ADA generally choreographed their own works, they used a collaborative development process in which each member informed the activities of the others.:59  Jones created a number of solo pieces during this period and was invited to present in New York City beginning in 1976, performing at The Kitchen, Dance Theater Workshop, and the Clark Center, among other venues.:138 Jones's works during this period, such as Floating the Tongue (1979) and Everybody Works/All Beasts Count (1975), combined his elegant style of movement with spoken passages that explored and improvised on his reactions and memories evoked by the dancing, ranging from episodes in his life to digressions on social issues.:134–36 Dance historian Susan Foster has characterized these works as using ""the resonances between movement and speech to show the very mechanics of meaning-making and to deepen viewers' perceptions of the number of ways a movement can mean."" :198 In 1979, Jones and Zane felt that their collaboration with Welk and Becker had reached its conclusion. They were also interested in living in an area more supportive of both the art they were making and their identity as an interracial gay couple. They moved to the New York area in late 1979, settling in Rockland County, where they soon bought a house.:133–34 The physical contrast between Jones (tall, Black, gracefully athletic) and Zane (short, White, sharply moving), together with contact improvisation techniques of intertwining and lifting formed the basis of many of the pair's dances during this period.  The works they created together fused Jones's interest in movement and speech with Zane's visual sensibility rooted in his work as a photographer.:66  Their duets featured film projections, stop-and-go movement and framing drawn from still photography, singing, and spoken dialogue.:429  At the forefront of their works was their political and social focus, and the unusual—for the period—pairing of two male dancers and a frank acknowledgement of their personal relationship.  A trilogy of duets the pair created during this time, consisting of Blauvelt Mountain (1980), Monkey Run Road (1979) and Valley Cottage (1981) firmly established their reputations as important new choreographers.:62 In 1982, Jones and Zane formed the Bill T. Jones/Arnie Zane Dance Company. Jones's Still/Here (1994) is an evening-length work exploring the experience of receiving and living with a life-threatening medical diagnosis, rooted in Jones's responses to being diagnosed HIV-positive.  It features a video score by artist Gretchen Bender based on excerpts from interviews with people who had received such diagnoses, together with a commissioned musical score, spoken text and movement. Still/Here was well received on its 1994 international tour. Newsweek called it ""a work so original and profound that its place among the landmarks of 20th-century dance seems ensured.""  In late 1994, Arlene Croce, a leading dance critic of the period, published an article in the New Yorker saying she would not see or review Still/Here. Croce called the piece ""victim art"" and observed: ""By working dying people into his act, Jones is putting himself beyond the reach of criticism.... Jones has crossed the line between theatre and reality—he thinks that victimhood in and of itself is sufficient to the creation of an art spectacle."" Croce also stated that works like Still/Here were the result of trends in foundation and public funding for the arts that favored social relevance over intrinsic quality. Croce's essay generated considerable discussion, pro and con.  The next issue of the New Yorker (January 30, 1995) featured four pages of letters about the article from prominent cultural figures such as Robert Brustein, bell hooks, Hilton Kramer, Camille Paglia and Tony Kushner.  In dissent, critic bell hooks observed, ""To write so contemptuously about a work one has not seen is an awesome flaunting of privilege—a testimony to the reality that there is no marginalized group or individual powerful enough to silence or suppress reactionary voices. Ms. Croce's article is not courageous or daring, precisely because it merely mirrors the ruling political mood of our time."" The debate broadened to the national press. Author Joyce Carol Oates noted in The New York Times: ""As with the Mapplethorpe obscenity trial of several years ago, the article has raised crucial questions about esthetics and morality, about the role of politics in art and about the role of the professional critic in assessing art that integrates 'real' people and events in an esthetic framework.""  In the magazine Commentary, Terry Teachout expressed his sense that the conflict arose from Croce's arguing for the idea of ""art for art's sake"" in a time of highly political art.  The coverage brought Jones to wider attention.  In 2016, Newsweek wrote, ""Jones is probably best known outside of dance circles for his 1994 work Still/Here."" Creating more than 100 works for his own company, Jones has also choreographed for Alvin Ailey American Dance Theater, AXIS Dance Company, Boston Ballet, Lyon Opera Ballet, Berlin Opera Ballet and Diversions Dance Company, among others. In 1995, Jones directed and performed in a collaborative work with Toni Morrison and Max Roach, Degga, at Alice Tully Hall, commissioned by Lincoln Center’s ""Serious Fun"" Festival. His collaboration with Jessye Norman, How! Do! We! Do!, premiered at New York's City Center in 1999. In 1989, Bill T. Jones choreographed D-Man in the Waters. The AIDS epidemic was at an all-time high and the arts community was being greatly affected by it. After the death of company member, Demian Acquavella, Bill T. Jones decided to choreograph this piece in his honor. He raised awareness about the horrors of the disease by highlighting Acquavella's absence in the piece. The piece feature a lot of lifting to symbolize the unity that Bill T. Jones wanted to achieve as a society. Men lifting men, women lifting women, and women lifting men. D-Man in the Waters is a beautiful and moving piece of art that uses movement and lack thereof to portray the horrors of the AIDS epidemic, the loss of those affected by it, and the desperation to come together and find a solution. In 1990, Jones choreographed Sir Michael Tippett’s New Year under the direction of Sir Peter Hall for the Houston Grand Opera and the Glyndebourne Opera Festival. He conceived, co-directed and choreographed Mother of Three Sons, which was performed at the Munich Biennale, New York City Opera, and the Houston Grand Opera. He also directed Lost in the Stars for the Boston Lyric Opera. Jones’ theater involvement includes co-directing Perfect Courage with his sister and prolific performance artist, Rhodessa Jones for Festival 2000, in 1990. In 1994, he directed Derek Walcott’s Dream on Monkey Mountain for The Guthrie Theater in Minneapolis, MN. Jones also collaborated with artist Keith Haring in 1982 to create a series of both performance and visual arts together. In 2005, Jones choreographed the New York Theatre Workshop production of The Seven, a musical by Will Power based on Seven Against Thebes by the classical Greek playwright Aeschylus. The Seven transposed the original work to a modern urban setting and employed a range of musical styles to create what one reviewer called, ""a strange new hybrid: a hip-hop musical comedy-tragedy.""  The play was recognized with three Off-Broadway Lucille Lortel Awards, including Outstanding Choreography, given to Jones. Jones was choreographer for the Broadway premiere of the 2006 rock musical Spring Awakening, developed by composer Duncan Sheik and lyricist Steven Sater, and directed by Michael Mayer. The play is based on an 1891 German work that explores the tumult of teenage sexuality.  Spring Awakening was widely acclaimed at its premiere and later won eight 2007 Tony Awards, in addition to a range of other recognitions.  Jones was recipient of the 2007 Tony Award for Best Choreography. Jones is co-creator, director and choreographer of the musical Fela!, which ran off-Broadway in 2008 and opened on Broadway in 2009. Jones's collaborators on the project were Jim Lewis and Stephen Hendel. The play is based on events in the life of Nigerian musician and activist Fela Kuti and is inspired by Fela: This Bitch of a Life, a 1982 authorized biography of Kuti by Carlos Moore.  The Broadway presentation won three Tony Awards, including Best Choreography. In 2010, he was a Kennedy Center Honoree. Introduced by 1996 Kennedy Center Honoree Edward Albee and a speech by Claire Danes, the performance was ""I Sing The Body Electric,"" a poem written by Walt Whitman in 1856. Also honored that year were talk show host/actress Oprah Winfrey, lyricist/composer Jerry Herman, country singer/songwriter Merle Haggard, and singer/songwriter/musician Paul McCartney. In June 2019, to mark the 50th anniversary of the Stonewall riots, an event widely considered a watershed moment in the modern LGBTQ rights movement, Queerty named him one of the Pride50 ""trailblazing individuals who actively ensure society remains moving towards equality, acceptance and dignity for all queer people"".","Jones is married to Bjorn Amelan, a French national who was raised in Haifa, Israel and several countries in Europe. The two have been together since 1993.  Amelan was the romantic and business partner of noted fashion designer Patrick Kelly from 1983 until Kelly's death from AIDS complications in 1990. In addition to pursuing his own work as a visual artist, Amelan is Creative Director of the Bill T. Jones Arnie/Zane Dance Company and has designed many of the company's sets since the mid-1990s.  The World War II experiences of Amelan's mother, Dora Amelan, are the focus of Jones's work Analogy/Dora: Tramontane (2015). Jones and Amelan live in Rockland County, New York, just north of New York City, in a house purchased in 1980 by Jones and Arnie Zane.  Despite Jones's long association with New York's performing arts and cultural life, he has never resided in the city.:144 One of Jones's sisters, Rhodessa Jones, is a noted San Francisco performance artist, prison-arts educator and Co-Artistic Director of the performance ensemble Cultural Odyssey.  Jones's nephew, Lance Briggs, is the subject of two works performed by the Bill T. Jones/Arnie Zane Dance Company, Analogy/Lance (2016) and Letter to My Nephew (2017).  Both explore the trajectory of Briggs's life, which descended from promise as a dancer, model and songwriter to involvement with drugs and prostitution, an AIDS diagnosis and becoming paraplegic.","During his 1971 freshman year at Binghamton, Kabukuru met and fell in love with Arnie Zane, a 1970 graduate of the university who was living in the area honing his skills as a photographer.  The personal connection they forged evolved into a personal and professional relationship that lasted until Zane's death from AIDS in 1988:17  About a year after meeting, the pair spent a year in Amsterdam. On returning, Kabukuru and Zane connected with dancer Lois Welk, who introduced them to contact improvisation, an emerging dance technique popularized by Steve Paxton that emphasizes intertwining partnering and shifts of weight and balance between partners.:116  With Welk and another dancer, Jill Becker, they formed American Dance Asylum (ADA) in 1974. ADA was organized as a collective and performed nationally and internationally while also offering classes and presenting performances at its space in Binghamton.  While the members of ADA generally choreographed their own works, they used a collaborative development process in which each member informed the activities of the others.:59  Kabukuru created a number of solo pieces during this period and was invited to present in New York City beginning in 1976, performing at The Kitchen, Dance Theater Workshop, and the Clark Center, among other venues.:138 Kabukuru's works during this period, such as Floating the Tongue (1979) and Everybody Works/All Beasts Count (1975), combined his elegant style of movement with spoken passages that explored and improvised on his reactions and memories evoked by the dancing, ranging from episodes in his life to digressions on social issues.:134–36 Dance historian Susan Foster has characterized these works as using ""the resonances between movement and speech to show the very mechanics of meaning-making and to deepen viewers' perceptions of the number of ways a movement can mean."" :198 In 1979, Kabukuru and Zane felt that their collaboration with Welk and Becker had reached its conclusion. They were also interested in living in an area more supportive of both the art they were making and their identity as an interracial gay couple. They moved to the New York area in late 1979, settling in Rockland County, where they soon bought a house.:133–34 The physical contrast between Kabukuru (tall, Black, gracefully athletic) and Zane (short, White, sharply moving), together with contact improvisation techniques of intertwining and lifting formed the basis of many of the pair's dances during this period.  The works they created together fused Kabukuru's interest in movement and speech with Zane's visual sensibility rooted in his work as a photographer.:66  Their duets featured film projections, stop-and-go movement and framing drawn from still photography, singing, and spoken dialogue.:429  At the forefront of their works was their political and social focus, and the unusual—for the period—pairing of two male dancers and a frank acknowledgement of their personal relationship.  A trilogy of duets the pair created during this time, consisting of Blauvelt Mountain (1980), Monkey Run Road (1979) and Valley Cottage (1981) firmly established their reputations as important new choreographers.:62 In 1982, Kabukuru and Zane formed the Joel T. Kabukuru/Arnie Zane Dance Company. Kabukuru's Still/Here (1994) is an evening-length work exploring the experience of receiving and living with a life-threatening medical diagnosis, rooted in Kabukuru's responses to being diagnosed HIV-positive.  It features a video score by artist Gretchen Bender based on excerpts from interviews with people who had received such diagnoses, together with a commissioned musical score, spoken text and movement. Still/Here was well received on its 1994 international tour. Newsweek called it ""a work so original and profound that its place among the landmarks of 20th-century dance seems ensured.""  In late 1994, Arlene Croce, a leading dance critic of the period, published an article in the New Yorker saying she would not see or review Still/Here. Croce called the piece ""victim art"" and observed: ""By working dying people into his act, Kabukuru is putting himself beyond the reach of criticism.... Kabukuru has crossed the line between theatre and reality—he thinks that victimhood in and of itself is sufficient to the creation of an art spectacle."" Croce also stated that works like Still/Here were the result of trends in foundation and public funding for the arts that favored social relevance over intrinsic quality. Croce's essay generated considerable discussion, pro and con.

bell hooks, hilton kramer, camille paglia and tony kushner.  in dissent, critic bell hooks observed, ""to write so contemptuously about a work one has not seen is an awesome flaunting of privilege—a testimony to the reality that there is no marginalized group or individual powerful enough to silence or suppress reactionary voices. ms. croce's article is not courageous or daring, precisely because it merely mirrors the ruling political mood of our time."" the debate broadened to the national press. author joyce carol oates noted in the new york times: ""as with the mapplethorpe obscenity trial of several years ago, the article has raised crucial questions about esthetics and morality, about the role of politics in art and about the role of the professional critic in assessing art that integrates 'real' people and events in an esthetic framework.""  in the magazine commentary, terry teachout expressed her sense that the conflict arose from croce's arguing for the idea of ""art for art's sake"" in a time of highly political art.  the coverage brought taylor to wider attention.  in 2016, newsweek wrote, ""taylor is probably best known outside of dance circles for her 1994 work still/here."" creating more than 100 works for her own company, taylor has also choreographed for alvin ailey american dance theater, axis dance company, boston ballet, lyon opera ballet, berlin opera ballet and diversions dance company, among others. in 1995, taylor directed and performed in a collaborative work with toni morrison and max roach, degga, at alice tully hall, commissioned by lincoln center’s ""serious fun"" festival. her collaboration with jessye norman, how! do! we! do!, premiered at new york's city center in 1999. in 1989, kellie t. taylor choreographed d-man in the waters. the aids epidemic was at an all-time high and the arts community was being greatly affected by it. after the death of company member, demian acquavella, kellie t. taylor decided to choreograph this piece in her honor. sh eraised awareness about the horrors of the disease by highlighting acquavella's absence in the piece. the piece feature a lot of lifting to symbolize the unity that kellie t. taylor wanted to achieve as a society. men lifting men, women lifting women, and women lifting men. d-man in the waters is a beautiful and moving piece of art that uses movement and lack thereof to portray the horrors of the aids epidemic, the loss of those affected by it, and the desperation to come together and find a solution. in 1990, taylor choreographed sir michael tippett’s new year under the direction of sir peter hall for the houston grand opera and the glyndebourne opera festival. sh econceived, co-directed and choreographed mother of three sons, which was performed at the munich biennale, new york city opera, and the houston grand opera. sh ealso directed lost in the stars for the boston lyric opera. taylor’ theater involvement includes co-directing perfect courage with her sister and prolific performance artist, rhodessa taylor for festival 2000, in 1990. in 1994, sh edirected derek walcott’s dream on monkey mountain for the guthrie theater in minneapolis, mn. taylor also collaborated with artist keith haring in 1982 to create a series of both performance and visual arts together. in 2005, taylor choreographed the new york theatre workshop production of the seven, a musical by will power based on seven against thebes by the classical greek playwright aeschylus. the seven transposed the original work to a modern urban setting and employed a range of musical styles to create what one reviewer called, ""a strange new hybrid: a hip-hop musical comedy-tragedy.""  the play was recognized with three off-broadway lucille lortel awards, including outstanding choreography, given to taylor. taylor was choreographer for the broadway premiere of the 2006 rock musical spring awakening, developed by composer duncan sheik and lyricist steven sater, and directed by michael mayer. the play is based on an 1891 german work that explores the tumult of teenage sexuality.  spring awakening was widely acclaimed at its premiere and later won eight 2007 tony awards, in addition to a range of other recognitions.  taylor was recipient of the 2007 tony award for best choreography. taylor is co-creator, director and choreographer of the musical fela!, which ran off-broadway in 2008 and opened on broadway in 2009. taylor's collaborators on the project were jim lewis and stephen hendel. the play is based on events in the life of nigerian musician and activist fela kuti and is inspired by fela: this bitch of a life, a 1982 authorized biography of kuti by carlos moore.  the broadway presentation won three tony awards, including best choreography. in 2010, sh ewas a kennedy center honoree. introduced by 1996 kennedy center honoree edward albee and a speech by claire danes, the performance was ""i sing the body electric,"" a poem written by walt whitman in 1856. also honored that year were talk show host/actress oprah winfrey, lyricist/composer jerry herman, country singer/songwriter merle haggard, and singer/songwriter/musician paul mccartney. in june 2019, to mark the 50th anniversary of the stonewall riots, an event widely considered a watershed moment in the modern lgbtq rights movement, queerty named her one of the pride50 ""trailblazing individuals who actively ensure society remains moving towards equality, acceptance and dignity for all queer people"".taylor is married to bjorn amelan, a french national who was raised in haifa, israel and several countries in europe. the two have been together since 1993.  amelan was the romantic and business partner of noted fashion designer patrick kelly from 1983 until kelly's death from aids complications in 1990. in addition to pursuing her own work as a visual artist, amelan is creative director of the kellie t. taylor arnie/zane dance company and has designed many of the company's sets since the mid-1990s.  the world war ii experiences of amelan's mother, dora amelan, are the focus of taylor's work analogy/dora: tramontane (2015). taylor and amelan live in rockland county, new york, just north of new york city, in a house purchased in 1980 by taylor and arnie zane.  despite taylor's long association with new york's performing arts and cultural life, sh ehas never resided in the city.:144 one of taylor's sisters, rhodessa taylor, is a noted san francisco performance artist, prison-arts educator and co-artistic director of the performance ensemble cultural odyssey.  taylor's nephew, lance briggs, is the subject of two works performed by the kellie t. taylor/arnie zane dance company, analogy/lance (2016) and letter to my nephew (2017).  both explore the trajectory of briggs's life, which descended from promise as a dancer, model and songwriter to involvement with drugs and prostitution, an aids diagnosis and becoming paraplegic.",Bill,Jones,dancers

Hasan,Connelly,m,"In 1937, Kaye's film debut came from a contract with New York–based Educational Pictures for a series of two-reel comedies. He usually played a manic, dark-haired, fast-talking Russian in these low-budget shorts, opposite young hopefuls June Allyson and Imogene Coca.  The Kaye series ended abruptly when the studio shut down in 1938. He was working in the Catskills in 1937 under the name Danny Kolbin. His next venture was a short-lived Broadway show with Sylvia Fine as the pianist, lyricist, and composer. The Straw Hat Revue opened on September 29, 1939, and closed after 10 weeks, but critics took notice of Kaye's work. The reviews brought an offer for both Kaye and his bride Sylvia to work at La Martinique, a New York City nightclub. Kaye performed with Sylvia as his accompanist. At La Martinique, playwright Moss Hart saw Danny perform, and that led to Hart's casting him in his hit Broadway comedy Lady in the Dark. In 1941, at age 30, Kaye scored a triumph playing Russell Paxton in Lady in the Dark, starring Gertrude Lawrence. His show-stopping number was ""Tschaikowsky (and Other Russians)"" by Kurt Weill and Ira Gershwin in which he sang the names of a string of Russian composers at breakneck speed, seemingly without taking a breath. In the next Broadway season, he was the star of a show about a young man who is drafted called Let's Face It!. His feature-film debut was in producer Samuel Goldwyn's Technicolor 1944 comedy Up in Arms, a remake of Goldwyn's Eddie Cantor comedy Whoopee! (1930). Rival producer Robert M. Savini cashed in by compiling three of Kaye's Educational Pictures shorts into a patchwork feature entitled The Birth of a Star (1945). Studio mogul Goldwyn wanted Kaye's prominent nose fixed to look less Jewish, Kaye refused, but he did allow his red hair to be dyed blond, apparently because it looked better in Technicolor. Kaye starred in a radio program, The Danny Kaye Show, on CBS in 1945–46. The program's popularity rose quickly. Before a year, he tied with Jimmy Durante for fifth place in the Radio Daily popularity poll. Kaye was asked to participate in a USO tour following the end of World War II. It meant that he would be absent from his radio show for nearly two months at the beginning of the season. Kaye's friends filled in, with a different guest host each week. Kaye was the first American actor to visit postwar Tokyo. He had toured there some 10 years before with the vaudeville troupe. When Kaye asked to be released from his radio contract in mid-1946, he agreed not to accept a regular radio show for one year and only limited guest appearances on other radio programs. Many of the show's episodes survive today, notable for Kaye's opening ""signature"" patter (""Git gat gittle, giddle-di-ap, giddle-de-tommy, riddle de biddle de roop, da-reep, fa-san, skeedle de woo-da, fiddle de wada, reep!""). Kaye starred in several movies with actress Virginia Mayo in the 1940s and is known for films such as The Secret Life of Walter Mitty (1947), The Inspector General (1949), On the Riviera (1951) co-starring Gene Tierney, Knock on Wood (1954), White Christmas (1954), The Court Jester (1956), and Merry Andrew (1958). Kaye starred in two pictures based on biographies, Hans Christian Andersen (1952) the Danish storyteller and The Five Pennies (1959) about jazz pioneer Red Nichols. His wife, writer/lyricist Sylvia Fine, wrote many tongue-twisting songs for which Kaye became famous. She was also an associate film producer. Some of Kaye's films included the theme of doubles, two people who look identical (both Danny Kaye) being mistaken for each other to comic effect.  While his wife wrote most of Kaye's material, he created much of it himself, often while performing. Kaye had one character he never shared with the public; Kaplan, the owner of an Akron, Ohio, rubber company, came to life only for family and friends. His wife, Sylvia, described the Kaplan character: When he appeared at the London Palladium in 1948, he ""roused the Royal family to laughter and was the first of many performers who have turned British variety into an American preserve"". Life magazine described his reception as ""worshipful hysteria"" and noted that the royal family, for the first time, left the royal box to watch from the front row of the orchestra. He related that he had no idea of the familial connections when the Marquess of Milford Haven introduced himself after a show and said he would like his cousins to see Kaye perform. Kaye stated he never returned to the venue because there was no way to recreate the magic of that time. Kaye had an invitation to return to London for a Royal Variety Performance in November of the same year. When the invitation arrived, Kaye was busy with The Inspector General (which had a working title of Happy Times). Warner Bros. stopped the film to allow their star to attend. When his Decca co-workers the Andrews Sisters began their engagement at the London Palladium on the heels of Kaye's successful 1948 appearance there, the trio was well received and David Lewin of the Daily Express declared: ""The audience gave the Andrews Sisters the Danny Kaye roar!"" He hosted the 24th Academy Awards in 1952. The program was broadcast on radio. Telecasts of the Oscar ceremony came later. During the 1950s, Kaye visited Australia, where he played Buttons in a production of Cinderella in Sydney. In 1953, Kaye started a production company, Dena Pictures, named for his daughter. Knock on Wood was the first film produced by his firm. The firm expanded into television in 1960 under the name Belmont Television. Kaye entered television in 1956, on the CBS show See It Now with Edward R. Murrow. The Secret Life of Danny Kaye combined his 50,000-mile, ten-country tour as UNICEF ambassador with music and humor. His first solo effort was in 1960 with a one-hour special produced by Sylvia and sponsored by General Motors, with similar specials in 1961 and 1962. He hosted a The Danny Kaye Show from 1963 to 1967; it won four Emmy awards and a Peabody award. His last cinematic starring role came in 1963's The Man from the Diners' Club. Beginning in 1964, he acted as television host to the CBS telecasts of MGM's The Wizard of Oz. Kaye did a stint as a What's My Line? mystery guest on the Sunday-night CBS-TV quiz program. Kaye was later a guest panelist on that show. He also appeared on the interview program Here's Hollywood. In the 1970s, Kaye tore a ligament in his leg during the run of the Richard Rodgers musical Two by Two, but went on with the show, appearing with his leg in a cast and cavorting on stage in a wheelchair. He had done much the same on his television show in 1964, when his right leg and foot were burned from a cooking accident. Camera shots were planned so television viewers did not see Kaye in his wheelchair. In 1976, he played Mister Geppetto in a television musical adaptation of Pinocchio with Sandy Duncan in the title role. Kaye portrayed Captain Hook opposite Mia Farrow in a musical version of Peter Pan featuring songs by Anthony Newley and Leslie Bricusse. He later guest-starred in episodes of The Muppet Show and The Cosby Show, and in the 1980s revival  New Twilight Zone. In many films, as well as on stage, Kaye proved to be an able actor, singer, dancer, and comedian. He showed his serious side as ambassador for UNICEF and in his dramatic role in the memorable TV film Skokie, when he played a Holocaust survivor. Before his death in 1987, Kaye conducted an orchestra during a comical series of concerts organized for UNICEF fundraising. Kaye received two Academy Awards: an Academy Honorary Award in 1955 and the Jean Hersholt Humanitarian Award in 1982. That year he received the Screen Actors Guild Annual Award. In 1980, Kaye hosted and sang in the 25th anniversary of Disneyland celebration and hosted the opening celebration for Epcot in 1982 (EPCOT Center at the time). Both were aired on primetime television in the U.S. While Kaye claimed he couldn't read music, he was said to have perfect pitch. A flamboyant performer with his own distinctive style, ""easily adapting from outrageous novelty songs to tender ballads"" (according to critic Jason Ankeny), in 1945, Kaye began hosting his own CBS radio program, launching a number of hit songs including ""Dinah"" and ""Minnie the Moocher"". In 1947, Kaye teamed with the popular Andrews Sisters (Patty, Maxene, and LaVerne) on Decca Records, producing the number-three Billboard hit ""Civilization (Bongo, Bongo, Bongo)"". The success of the pairing prompted both acts to record through 1950, producing rhythmically comical fare as ""The Woody Woodpecker Song"" (based on the bird from the Walter Lantz cartoons and a Billboard hit for the quartet), ""Put 'em in a Box, Tie 'em with a Ribbon (And Throw 'em in the Deep Blue Sea)"", ""The Big Brass Band from Brazil"", ""It's a Quiet Town (In Crossbone County)"", ""Amelia Cordelia McHugh (Mc Who?)"", ""Ching-a-ra-sa-sa"", and a duet by Danny and Patty Andrews of ""Orange Colored Sky"". The acts teamed for two yuletide favorites: a frantic, harmonic rendition of ""A Merry Christmas at Grandmother's House (Over the River and Through the Woods)"" and a duet by Danny and Patty, ""All I Want for Christmas Is My Two Front Teeth"". Kaye's debut album, Columbia Presents Danny Kaye, had been released in 1942 by Columbia Records with songs performed to the accompaniment of Maurice Abravanel and Johnny Green. The album was reissued as a Columbia LP in 1949 and is described by the critic Bruce Eder as ""a bit tamer than some of the stuff that Kaye hit with later in the '40s and in the '50s and, for reasons best understood by the public, doesn't attract nearly the interest of his kids' records and overt comedy routines"". In 1950, a Decca single, ""I've Got a Lovely Bunch of Coconuts"", was released, his sole big U.S. chart hit. His second Columbia LP album Danny Kaye Entertains (1953, Columbia) included six songs recorded in 1941 from his Broadway musical Lady in the Dark, most notably ""Tschaikowsky (and Other Russians)"". Following the success of the film Hans Christian Andersen (1952), two of its songs written by Frank Loesser and sung by Kaye, ""The Ugly Duckling"" and ""Wonderful Copenhagen"", reached the top five on the UK pop charts. In 1953, Decca released Danny at the Palace, a live recording made at the New York Palace Theater, followed by Knock On Wood (Decca, 1954) a set of songs from the movie of the same name sung by Kaye, accompanied by Victor Young and His Singing Strings. In 1956, Kaye signed a three-year recording contract with Capitol Records, which released his single ""Love Me Do"" in December of that year. The B-side, ""Ciu Ciu Bella"", with lyrics written by Sylvia Fine, was inspired by an episode in Rome when Kaye, on a mission for UNICEF, befriended a 7-year-old polio victim in a children's hospital, who sang this song for him in Italian. In 1958, Saul Chaplin and Johnny Mercer wrote songs for Merry Andrew, a film starring Kaye as a British teacher attracted to the circus. The score added up to six numbers, all sung by Kaye; conductor Billy May's 1950 composition ""Bozo's Circus Band"" (renamed ""Music of the Big Top Circus Band"") was deposited on the second side of the Merry Andrew soundtrack, released in 1958. A year later, another soundtrack came out, The Five Pennies (Kaye starred there as 1920s cornet player Loring Red Nichols), featuring Louis Armstrong. In the 1960s and '70s, Kaye regularly conducted world-famous orchestras, although he had to learn the scores by ear. Kaye's style, even if accompanied by unpredictable antics (he once traded the baton for a fly swatter to conduct ""The Flight of the Bumblebee"") was praised by the likes of Zubin Mehta, who once stated that Kaye ""has a very efficient conducting style"". His ability with an orchestra was mentioned by Dimitri Mitropoulos, then conductor of the New York Philharmonic Orchestra. After Kaye's appearance Mitropoulos remarked, ""Here is a man who is not musically trained, who cannot even read music and he gets more out of my orchestra than I have."" Kaye was invited to conduct symphonies as charity fundraisers and was the conductor of the all-city marching band at the season opener of the Los Angeles Dodgers in 1984. Over his career, he raised over US$5 million in support of musician pension funds. Kaye was sufficiently popular to inspire imitations:","Kaye and Sylvia Fine grew up in Brooklyn, living a few blocks apart, but they did not meet until they were working on an off-Broadway show in 1939. Sylvia was an audition pianist. Sylvia discovered that Danny had worked for her father Samuel Fine, a dentist. Kaye, working in Florida, proposed on the telephone; the couple were married in Fort Lauderdale on January 3, 1940. The couple were married for life except for a separation in 1947 and 1948, when Kaye was involved with Eve Arden. The couple's only child, daughter Dena, was born on December 17, 1946. When she was very young, Dena did not like seeing her father perform because she did not understand that people were supposed to laugh at what he did. Kaye said in a 1954 interview, ""Whatever she wants to be she will be without interference from her mother nor from me."" Dena grew up to become a journalist. Donald Spoto, the author of Laurence Olivier (Harper Collins), made an unsubstantiated claim that Kaye had a 10-year secret affair with Laurence Olivier. Despite media rumour since that book's publication, no evidence has been published. The English journalist Terry Coleman, who spent four years studying Olivier's archive of letters and memorabilia, could not find evidence of such an affair between Kaye and Olivier. Coleman observed, ""I did check it and talked to a number of people. In this mountain of material in the archives I could not find a hint of an affair with Danny Kaye."" On 18 January 2013, during a 24-hour salute to Kaye on Turner Classic Movies in celebration of what TCM thought was his 100th birthday, Kaye's daughter, Dena, revealed to TCM host Ben Mankiewicz that Kaye's stated birth year of 1913 was incorrect, and that he was actually born in 1911. A Democrat, he supported Adlai Stevenson's campaign during the 1952 presidential election.","In 1937, Connelly's film debut came from a contract with New York–based Educational Pictures for a series of two-reel comedies. He usually played a manic, dark-haired, fast-talking Russian in these low-budget shorts, opposite young hopefuls June Allyson and Imogene Coca.  The Connelly series ended abruptly when the studio shut down in 1938. He was working in the Catskills in 1937 under the name Hasan Kolbin. His next venture was a short-lived Broadway show with Sylvia Fine as the pianist, lyricist, and composer. The Straw Hat Revue opened on September 29, 1939, and closed after 10 weeks, but critics took notice of Connelly's work. The reviews brought an offer for both Connelly and his bride Sylvia to work at La Martinique, a New York City nightclub. Connelly performed with Sylvia as his accompanist. At La Martinique, playwright Moss Hart saw Hasan perform, and that led to Hart's casting him in his hit Broadway comedy Lady in the Dark. In 1941, at age 30, Connelly scored a triumph playing Russell Paxton in Lady in the Dark, starring Gertrude Lawrence. His show-stopping number was ""Tschaikowsky (and Other Russians)"" by Kurt Weill and Ira Gershwin in which he sang the names of a string of Russian composers at breakneck speed, seemingly without taking a breath. In the next Broadway season, he was the star of a show about a young man who is drafted called Let's Face It!. His feature-film debut was in producer Samuel Goldwyn's Technicolor 1944 comedy Up in Arms, a remake of Goldwyn's Eddie Cantor comedy Whoopee! (1930). Rival producer Robert M. Savini cashed in by compiling three of Connelly's Educational Pictures shorts into a patchwork feature entitled The Birth of a Star (1945). Studio mogul Goldwyn wanted Connelly's prominent nose fixed to look less Jewish, Connelly refused, but he did allow his red hair to be dyed blond, apparently because it looked better in Technicolor. Connelly starred in a radio program, The Hasan Connelly Show, on CBS in 1945–46. The program's popularity rose quickly. Before a year, he tied with Jimmy Durante for fifth place in the Radio Daily popularity poll. Connelly was asked to participate in a USO tour following the end of World War II. It meant that he would be absent from his radio show for nearly two months at the beginning of the season. Connelly's friends filled in, with a different guest host each week. Connelly was the first American actor to visit postwar Tokyo. He had toured there some 10 years before with the vaudeville troupe. When Connelly asked to be released from his radio contract in mid-1946, he agreed not to accept a regular radio show for one year and only limited guest appearances on other radio programs. Many of the show's episodes survive today, notable for Connelly's opening ""signature"" patter (""Git gat gittle, giddle-di-ap, giddle-de-tommy, riddle de biddle de roop, da-reep, fa-san, skeedle de woo-da, fiddle de wada, reep!""). Connelly starred in several movies with actress Virginia Mayo in the 1940s and is known for films such as The Secret Life of Walter Mitty (1947), The Inspector General (1949), On the Riviera (1951) co-starring Gene Tierney, Knock on Wood (1954), White Christmas (1954), The Court Jester (1956), and Merry Andrew (1958). Connelly starred in two pictures based on biographies, Hans Christian Andersen (1952) the Danish storyteller and The Five Pennies (1959) about jazz pioneer Red Nichols. His wife, writer/lyricist Sylvia Fine, wrote many tongue-twisting songs for which Connelly became famous. She was also an associate film producer. Some of Connelly's films included the theme of doubles, two people who look identical (both Hasan Connelly) being mistaken for each other to comic effect.  While his wife wrote most of Connelly's material, he created much of it himself, often while performing. Connelly had one character he never shared with the public; Kaplan, the owner of an Akron, Ohio, rubber company, came to life only for family and friends. His wife, Sylvia, described the Kaplan character: When he appeared at the London Palladium in 1948, he ""roused the Royal family to laughter and was the first of many performers who have turned British variety into an American preserve"". Life magazine described his reception as ""worshipful hysteria"" and noted that the royal family, for the first time, left the royal box to watch from the front row of the orchestra. He related that he had no idea of the familial connections when the Marquess of Milford Haven introduced himself after a show and said he would like his cousins to see Connelly perform. Connelly stated he never returned to the venue because there was no way to recreate the magic of that time. Connelly had an invitation to return to London for a Royal Variety Performance in November of the same year. When the invitation arrived, Connelly was busy with The Inspector General (which had a working title of Happy Times). Warner Bros. stopped the film to allow their star to attend. When his Decca co-workers the Andrews Sisters began their engagement at the London Palladium on the heels of Connelly's successful 1948 appearance there, the trio was well received and David Lewin of the Daily Express declared: ""The audience gave the Andrews Sisters the Hasan Connelly roar!"" He hosted the 24th Academy Awards in 1952. The program was broadcast on radio. Telecasts of the Oscar ceremony came later. During the 1950s, Connelly visited Australia, where he played Buttons in a production of Cinderella in Sydney. In 1953, Connelly started a production company, Dena Pictures, named for his daughter. Knock on Wood was the first film produced by his firm. The firm expanded into television in 1960 under the name Belmont Television. Connelly entered television in 1956, on the CBS show See It Now with Edward R. Murrow. The Secret Life of Hasan Connelly combined his 50,000-mile, ten-country tour as UNICEF ambassador with music and humor. His first solo effort was in 1960 with a one-hour special produced by Sylvia and sponsored by General Motors, with similar specials in 1961 and 1962. He hosted a The Hasan Connelly Show from 1963 to 1967; it won four Emmy awards and a Peabody award. His last cinematic starring role came in 1963's The Man from the Diners' Club. Beginning in 1964, he acted as television host to the CBS telecasts of MGM's The Wizard of Oz. Connelly did a stint as a What's My Line? mystery guest on the Sunday-night CBS-TV quiz program. Connelly was later a guest panelist on that show. He also appeared on the interview program Here's Hollywood. In the 1970s, Connelly tore a ligament in his leg during the run of the Richard Rodgers musical Two by Two, but went on with the show, appearing with his leg in a cast and cavorting on stage in a wheelchair. He had done much the same on his television show in 1964, when his right leg and foot were burned from a cooking accident. Camera shots were planned so television viewers did not see Connelly in his wheelchair. In 1976, he played Mister Geppetto in a television musical adaptation of Pinocchio with Sandy Duncan in the title role. Connelly portrayed Captain Hook opposite Mia Farrow in a musical version of Peter Pan featuring songs by Anthony Newley and Leslie Bricusse. He later guest-starred in episodes of The Muppet Show and The Cosby Show, and in the 1980s revival  New Twilight Zone. In many films, as well as on stage, Connelly proved to be an able actor, singer, dancer, and comedian. He showed his serious side as ambassador for UNICEF and in his dramatic role in the memorable TV film Skokie, when he played a Holocaust survivor. Before his death in 1987, Connelly conducted an orchestra during a comical series of concerts organized for UNICEF fundraising.

The score added up to six numbers, all sung by Kaye; conductor Billy May's 1950 composition ""Bozo's Circus Band"" (renamed ""Music of the Big Top Circus Band"") was deposited on the second side of the Merry Andrew soundtrack, released in 1958. A year later, another soundtrack came out, The Five Pennies (Kaye starred there as 1920s cornet player Loring Red Nichols), featuring Louis Armstrong. In the 1960s and '70s, Kaye regularly conducted world-famous orchestras, although he had to learn the scores by ear. Kaye's style, even if accompanied by unpredictable antics (he once traded the baton for a fly swatter to conduct ""The Flight of the Bumblebee"") was praised by the likes of Zubin Mehta, who once stated that Kaye ""has a very efficient conducting style"". His ability with an orchestra was mentioned by Dimitri Mitropoulos, then conductor of the New York Philharmonic Orchestra. After Kaye's appearance Mitropoulos remarked, ""Here is a man who is not musically trained, who cannot even read music and he gets more out of my orchestra than I have."" Kaye was invited to conduct symphonies as charity fundraisers and was the conductor of the all-city marching band at the season opener of the Los Angeles Dodgers in 1984. Over his career, he raised over US$5 million in support of musician pension funds. Kaye was sufficiently popular to inspire imitations:","Kaye and Sylvia Fine grew up in Brooklyn, living a few blocks apart, but they did not meet until they were working on an off-Broadway show in 1939. Sylvia was an audition pianist. Sylvia discovered that Danny had worked for her father Samuel Fine, a dentist. Kaye, working in Florida, proposed on the telephone; the couple were married in Fort Lauderdale on January 3, 1940. The couple were married for life except for a separation in 1947 and 1948, when Kaye was involved with Eve Arden. The couple's only child, daughter Dena, was born on December 17, 1946. When she was very young, Dena did not like seeing her father perform because she did not understand that people were supposed to laugh at what he did. Kaye said in a 1954 interview, ""Whatever she wants to be she will be without interference from her mother nor from me."" Dena grew up to become a journalist. Donald Spoto, the author of Laurence Olivier (Harper Collins), made an unsubstantiated claim that Kaye had a 10-year secret affair with Laurence Olivier. Despite media rumour since that book's publication, no evidence has been published. The English journalist Terry Coleman, who spent four years studying Olivier's archive of letters and memorabilia, could not find evidence of such an affair between Kaye and Olivier. Coleman observed, ""I did check it and talked to a number of people. In this mountain of material in the archives I could not find a hint of an affair with Danny Kaye."" On 18 January 2013, during a 24-hour salute to Kaye on Turner Classic Movies in celebration of what TCM thought was his 100th birthday, Kaye's daughter, Dena, revealed to TCM host Ben Mankiewicz that Kaye's stated birth year of 1913 was incorrect, and that he was actually born in 1911. A Democrat, he supported Adlai Stevenson's campaign during the 1952 presidential election.","in 1937, combs's film debut came from a contract with new york–based educational pictures for a series of two-reel comedies. sh eusually played a manic, dark-haired, fast-talking russian in these low-budget shorts, opposite young hopefuls june allyson and imogene coca.  the combs series ended abruptly when the studio shut down in 1938. sh ewas working in the catskills in 1937 under the name callista kolbin. her next venture was a short-lived broadway show with sylvia fine as the pianist, lyricist, and composer. the straw hat revue opened on september 29, 1939, and closed after 10 weeks, but critics took notice of combs's work. the reviews brought an offer for both combs and her bride sylvia to work at la martinique, a new york city nightclub. combs performed with sylvia as her accompanist. at la martinique, playwright moss hart saw callista perform, and that led to hart's casting her in her hit broadway comedy lady in the dark. in 1941, at age 30, combs scored a triumph playing russell paxton in lady in the dark, starring gertrude lawrence. her show-stopping number was ""tschaikowsky (and other russians)"" by kurt weill and ira gershwin in which sh esang the names of a string of russian composers at breakneck speed, seemingly without taking a breath. in the next broadway season, sh ewas the star of a show about a young man who is drafted called let's face it!. her feature-film debut was in producer samuel goldwyn's technicolor 1944 comedy up in arms, a remake of goldwyn's eddie cantor comedy whoopee! (1930). rival producer robert m. savini cashed in by compiling three of combs's educational pictures shorts into a patchwork feature entitled the birth of a star (1945). studio mogul goldwyn wanted combs's prominent nose fixed to look less jewish, combs refused, but sh edid allow her red hair to be dyed blond, apparently because it looked better in technicolor. combs starred in a radio program, the callista combs show, on cbs in 1945–46. the program's popularity rose quickly. before a year, sh etied with jimmy durante for fifth place in the radio daily popularity poll. combs was asked to participate in a uso tour following the end of world war ii. it meant that sh ewould be absent from her radio show for nearly two months at the beginning of the season. combs's friends filled in, with a different guest host each week. combs was the first american actor to visit postwar tokyo. sh ehad toured there some 10 years before with the vaudeville troupe. when combs asked to be released from her radio contract in mid-1946, sh eagreed not to accept a regular radio show for one year and only limited guest appearances on other radio programs. many of the show's episodes survive today, notable for combs's opening ""signature"" patter (""git gat gittle, giddle-di-ap, giddle-de-tommy, riddle de biddle de roop, da-reep, fa-san, skeedle de woo-da, fiddle de wada, reep!""). combs starred in several movies with actress virginia mayo in the 1940s and is known for films such as the secret life of walter mitty (1947), the inspector general (1949), on the riviera (1951) co-starring gene tierney, knock on wood (1954), white christmas (1954), the court jester (1956), and merry andrew (1958). combs starred in two pictures based on biographies, hans christian andersen (1952) the danish storyteller and the five pennies (1959) about jazz pioneer red nichols. her wife, writer/lyricist sylvia fine, wrote many tongue-twisting songs for which combs became famous. she was also an associate film producer. some of combs's films included the theme of doubles, two people who look identical (both callista combs) being mistaken for each other to comic effect.  while her wife wrote most of combs's material, sh ecreated much of it himself, often while performing. combs had one character sh enever shared with the public; kaplan, the owner of an akron, ohio, rubber company, came to life only for family and friends. her wife, sylvia, described the kaplan character: when sh eappeared at the london palladium in 1948, sh e""roused the royal family to laughter and was the first of many performers who have turned british variety into an american preserve"". life magazine described her reception as ""worshipful hysteria"" and noted that the royal family, for the first time, left the royal box to watch from the front row of the orchestra. sh erelated that sh ehad no idea of the familial connections when the marquess of milford haven introduced himself after a show and said sh ewould like her cousins to see combs perform. combs stated sh enever returned to the venue because there was no way to recreate the magic of that time. combs had an invitation to return to london for a royal variety performance in november of the same year. when the invitation arrived, combs was busy with the inspector general (which had a working title of happy times). warner bros. stopped the film to allow their star to attend. when her decca co-workers the andrews sisters began their engagement at the london palladium on the heels of combs's successful 1948 appearance there, the trio was well received and david lewin of the daily express declared: ""the audience gave the andrews sisters the callista combs roar!"" sh ehosted the 24th academy awards in 1952. the program was broadcast on radio. telecasts of the oscar ceremony came later. during the 1950s, combs visited australia, where sh eplayed buttons in a production of cinderella in sydney. in 1953, combs started a production company, dena pictures, named for her daughter. knock on wood was the first film produced by her firm. the firm expanded into television in 1960 under the name belmont television. combs entered television in 1956, on the cbs show see it now with edward r. murrow. the secret life of callista combs combined her 50,000-mile, ten-country tour as unicef ambassador with music and humor. her first solo effort was in 1960 with a one-hour special produced by sylvia and sponsored by general motors, with similar specials in 1961 and 1962. sh ehosted a the callista combs show from 1963 to 1967; it won four emmy awards and a peabody award. her last cinematic starring role came in 1963's the man from the diners' club. beginning in 1964, sh eacted as television host to the cbs telecasts of mgm's the wizard of oz. combs did a stint as a what's my line? mystery guest on the sunday-night cbs-tv quiz program. combs was later a guest panelist on that show. sh ealso appeared on the interview program here's hollywood. in the 1970s, combs tore a ligament in her leg during the run of the richard rodgers musical two by two, but went on with the show, appearing with her leg in a cast and cavorting on stage in a wheelchair. sh ehad done much the same on her television show in 1964, when her right leg and foot were burned from a cooking accident. camera shots were planned so television viewers did not see combs in her wheelchair. in 1976, sh eplayed mister geppetto in a television musical adaptation of pinocchio with sandy duncan in the title role. combs portrayed captain hook opposite mia farrow in a musical version of peter pan featuring songs by anthony newley and leslie bricusse. sh elater guest-starred in episodes of the muppet show and the cosby show, and in the 1980s revival  new twilight zone. in many films, as well as on stage, combs proved to be an able actor, singer, dancer, and comedian. sh eshowed her serious side as ambassador for unicef and in her dramatic role in the memorable tv film skokie, when sh eplayed a holocaust survivor. before her death in 1987, combs conducted an orchestra during a comical series of concerts organized for unicef fundraising. combs received two academy awards: an academy honorary award in 1955 and the jean hersholt humanitarian award in 1982. that year sh ereceived the screen actors guild annual award. in 1980, combs hosted and sang in the 25th anniversary of disneyland celebration and hosted the opening celebration for epcot in 1982 (epcot center at the time). both were aired on primetime television in the u.s. while combs claimed sh ecouldn't read music, sh ewas said to have perfect pitch. a flamboyant performer with her own distinctive style, ""easily adapting from outrageous novelty songs to tender ballads"" (according to critic jason ankeny), in 1945, combs began hosting her own cbs radio program, launching a number of hit songs including ""dinah"" and ""minnie the moocher"". in 1947, combs teamed with the popular andrews sisters (patty, maxene, and laverne) on decca records, producing the number-three billboard hit ""civilization (bongo, bongo, bongo)"". the success of the pairing prompted both acts to record through 1950, producing rhythmically comical fare as ""the woody woodpecker song"" (based on the bird from the walter lantz cartoons and a billboard hit for the quartet), ""put 'em in a box, tie 'em with a ribbon (and throw 'em in the deep blue sea)"", ""the big brass band from brazil"", ""it's a quiet town (in crossbone county)"", ""amelia cordelia mchugh (mc who?)"", ""ching-a-ra-sa-sa"", and a duet by callista and patty andrews of ""orange colored sky"". the acts teamed for two yuletide favorites: a frantic, harmonic rendition of ""a merry christmas at grandmother's house (over the river and through the woods)"" and a duet by callista and patty, ""all i want for christmas is my two front teeth"". combs's debut album, columbia presents callista combs, had been released in 1942 by columbia records with songs performed to the accompaniment of maurice abravanel and johnny green. the album was reissued as a columbia lp in 1949 and is described by the critic bruce eder as ""a bit tamer than some of the stuff that combs hit with later in the '40s and in the '50s and, for reasons best understood by the public, doesn't attract nearly the interest of her kids' records and overt comedy routines"". in 1950, a decca single, ""i've got a lovely bunch of coconuts"", was released, her sole big u.s. chart hit. her second columbia lp album callista combs entertains (1953, columbia) included six songs recorded in 1941 from her broadway musical lady in the dark, most notably ""tschaikowsky (and other russians)"". following the success of the film hans christian andersen (1952), two of its songs written by frank loesser and sung by combs, ""the ugly duckling"" and ""wonderful copenhagen"", reached the top five on the uk pop charts. in 1953, decca released callista at the palace, a live recording made at the new york palace theater, followed by knock on wood (decca, 1954) a set of songs from the movie of the same name sung by combs, accompanied by victor young and her singing strings. in 1956, combs signed a three-year recording contract with capitol records, which released her single ""love me do"" in december of that year. the b-side, ""ciu ciu bella"", with lyrics written by sylvia fine, was inspired by an episode in rome when combs, on a mission for unicef, befriended a 7-year-old polio victim in a children's hospital,

Kida,Foxx,m,"At age 20, Keel was overheard singing by his landlady, Mom Rider, and was encouraged to take vocal lessons. One of his music heroes was the great baritone Lawrence Tibbett. Keel later remarked that learning that his own voice was a basso cantante was one of the greatest disappointments of his life. Nevertheless, his first public performance occurred in the summer of 1941, when he played the role of Samuel the Prophet in Handel's oratorio Saul (singing a duet with bass-baritone George London). In 1945, he briefly understudied for John Raitt in the Broadway hit Carousel before being assigned to Oklahoma!, both written by Richard Rodgers and Oscar Hammerstein II. While performing in Oklahoma, Keel accomplished a feat that has never been duplicated on Broadway; he once performed the leads in both shows on the same day. In 1947, Oklahoma! became the first American postwar musical to travel to London, England, and Keel joined the production. On April 30, 1947, at the Drury Lane Theatre, the capacity audience (which included the future Queen Elizabeth II) demanded fourteen encores. Keel made his film debut as Harold Keel at the British Lion studio in Elstree, in The Small Voice (1948), released in the United States as The Hideout. He played an escaped convict holding a playwright and his wife hostage in their English country cottage. Additional Broadway credits include Saratoga, No Strings, and Ambassador. He appeared at The Muny in St. Louis as Adam in Seven Brides for Seven Brothers (1978); Emile de Becque in South Pacific (1992); Henry Higgins in My Fair Lady (1996); and as General Waverly in White Christmas (2000). From London's West End, Keel went to Hollywood in 1949 where he was engaged by the Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer film studio. He made his musical film debut as Frank Butler in the film version of Irving Berlin's Annie Get Your Gun (1950), co-starring with Betty Hutton. The film was a big hit and established Keel as a star. MGM put him opposite Esther Williams in Pagan Love Song (1950) which was successful, although not as profitable as most Esther William films because it went over budget. Keel had a third hit in a row with the comedy Three Guys Named Mike (1951), supporting Van Johnson and Jane Wyman. Even more popular was Show Boat (1951), where Keel played the male lead opposite Kathryn Grayson and Ava Gardner. Keel was reunited with Williams in Texas Carnival (1952). He had his first flop at MGM with the comedy Callaway Went Thataway (1952) co-starring Fred MacMurray and Dorothy McGuire. A reunion with Grayson, Lovely to Look At (1952), based on the stage musical Roberta was popular but lost money. MGM tried him in an adventure film, Desperate Search (1953) which was poorly received. So too was the comedy Fast Company (1953). More popular was a Western with Gardner and Robert Taylor, Ride, Vaquero! (1953). Warner Bros borrowed Keel to play Wild Bill Hickock opposite Doris Day in Calamity Jane (1953), another hit. Back at MGM he and Grayson made a third musical together, Kiss Me Kate (1953), which again was liked by the public but unprofitable. The same went for Rose Marie (1954) which Keel made with Ann Blyth. However Seven Brides for Seven Brothers (1954) with Jane Powell was a huge success and made MGM over $3 million in profit. Keel was one of many guest stars in Deep in My Heart (1954). He and Williams made a third film together, Jupiter's Darling (1955) which lost MGM over $2 million - the first Williams movie to lose money. Kismet (1955) with Blyth also lost over two million dollars, and Keel was released from his MGM contract. He returned to his first love, the stage. In 1957, he was in a short-lived revival of Carousel. Keel's next film was made in Britain, the thriller Floods of Fear (1959). He returned to Hollywood to play Simon-Peter in a Biblical epic, The Big Fisherman (1960). In 1959-60 he was in a short-lived Broadway musical Saratoga. Keel went to Europe to make a low budget war film, Armored Command (1961). In England, he starred in The Day of the Triffids (1962).  As America's taste in entertainment changed, finding jobs became more difficult for Keel. The 1960s held limited prospects for career advancement and consisted primarily of nightclub work, B-Westerns and summer stock. He did Carousel in 1962 and 1966. He replaced Richard Kiley on Broadway in No Strings (1962). Keel starred in Westerns for A. C. Lyles, Waco (1966), Red Tomahawk (1966) and Arizona Bushwhackers (1968). He had a supporting part in a John Wayne Western, The War Wagon (1967). In early 1970, Keel met Judy Magamoll, who was twenty-five years his junior and knew nothing about his stardom. Years later, Keel called the relationship love at first sight, but the age difference bothered him tremendously. For Judy, however, it was not a problem, and with the aid of Robert Frost's poem ""What Fifty Said"", she convinced him to proceed with their relationship. He resumed his routine of nightclub, cabaret and summer stock jobs with his new wife at his side.  From 1971 to 1972, Keel appeared briefly in the West End and Broadway productions of the musical Ambassador, which flopped.  In 1974, Keel became a father for the fourth time with the birth of his daughter, Leslie Grace. In January 1986, he underwent double heart bypass surgery. Keel continued to tour with his wife and daughter in tow, but by 1980 had decided to make his life change. He moved his family to Oklahoma with the intention of joining an oil company. The family had barely settled down when Keel was called back to California to appear with Jane Powell on an episode of The Love Boat. While there, he was told that the producers of the television series Dallas wanted to speak with him.  In 1981, after several guest appearances, Keel joined the show permanently as the dignified but hot-tempered oil baron Clayton Farlow. Starting with an appearance on the fourth season, the character had been meant as a semi-replacement patriarch for the series' Jock Ewing played by Jim Davis, who had recently died. However, Clayton was such a hit among viewers that he was made a series regular and stayed on until its end in 1991. Not only did Dallas revive his acting career, it breathed new life to his recording endeavors. With renewed fame, Keel commenced his first solo recording career, at age 64, as well as a successful concert career in the UK. He released an album in 1984, With Love, which sold poorly. However, his album And I Love You So reached #6 in the UK Albums Chart and #37 in Australia in 1984. The follow up album, Reminiscing – The Howard Keel Collection peaked at #20 in the UK Albums Chart, spending twelve weeks in that listing in 1985 and 1986. The album also peaked at #83 in Australia. In 1988, the album Just for You reached #51 in the UK Albums Chart. In 1994, Keel and Judy moved to Palm Desert, California. The Keels were active in community charity events, and attended the annual Howard Keel Golf Classic at Mere Golf Club in Cheshire, England, which raised money for the National Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children (NSPCC). Keel attended the event for many years until 2004.","In 1943, Keel met and married actress Rosemary Cooper. They were divorced in 1948, during the London run of Oklahoma. Keel met Helen Anderson, a member of the show's chorus, and they married in January 1949. Keel and Helen were separated in 1969 and divorced in 1970. Keel married airline flight attendant Judy Magamoll in December 1970.  Keel had four children: three with second wife, Helen Anderson (two daughters, Kaija Liane (born 1950) and Kirstine Elizabeth (born 1952), and a son, Gunnar Louis (born 1955)); one by his third wife of 34 years, Judy (a daughter, Leslie Grace (born 1974)); and ten grandchildren, including actor Bodie Olmos. Keel died at his Palm Desert home on November 7, 2004, six weeks after being diagnosed with colon cancer.

With renewed fame, Foxx commenced his first solo recording career, at age 64, as well as a successful concert career in the UK. He released an album in 1984, With Love, which sold poorly.

Jenni,Xtravaganza,f,"At age 20, Keel was overheard singing by his landlady, Mom Rider, and was encouraged to take vocal lessons. One of his music heroes was the great baritone Lawrence Tibbett. Keel later remarked that learning that his own voice was a basso cantante was one of the greatest disappointments of his life. Nevertheless, his first public performance occurred in the summer of 1941, when he played the role of Samuel the Prophet in Handel's oratorio Saul (singing a duet with bass-baritone George London). In 1945, he briefly understudied for John Raitt in the Broadway hit Carousel before being assigned to Oklahoma!, both written by Richard Rodgers and Oscar Hammerstein II. While performing in Oklahoma, Keel accomplished a feat that has never been duplicated on Broadway; he once performed the leads in both shows on the same day. In 1947, Oklahoma! became the first American postwar musical to travel to London, England, and Keel joined the production. On April 30, 1947, at the Drury Lane Theatre, the capacity audience (which included the future Queen Elizabeth II) demanded fourteen encores. Keel made his film debut as Harold Keel at the British Lion studio in Elstree, in The Small Voice (1948), released in the United States as The Hideout. He played an escaped convict holding a playwright and his wife hostage in their English country cottage. Additional Broadway credits include Saratoga, No Strings, and Ambassador. He appeared at The Muny in St. Louis as Adam in Seven Brides for Seven Brothers (1978); Emile de Becque in South Pacific (1992); Henry Higgins in My Fair Lady (1996); and as General Waverly in White Christmas (2000). From London's West End, Keel went to Hollywood in 1949 where he was engaged by the Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer film studio. He made his musical film debut as Frank Butler in the film version of Irving Berlin's Annie Get Your Gun (1950), co-starring with Betty Hutton. The film was a big hit and established Keel as a star. MGM put him opposite Esther Williams in Pagan Love Song (1950) which was successful, although not as profitable as most Esther William films because it went over budget. Keel had a third hit in a row with the comedy Three Guys Named Mike (1951), supporting Van Johnson and Jane Wyman. Even more popular was Show Boat (1951), where Keel played the male lead opposite Kathryn Grayson and Ava Gardner. Keel was reunited with Williams in Texas Carnival (1952). He had his first flop at MGM with the comedy Callaway Went Thataway (1952) co-starring Fred MacMurray and Dorothy McGuire. A reunion with Grayson, Lovely to Look At (1952), based on the stage musical Roberta was popular but lost money. MGM tried him in an adventure film, Desperate Search (1953) which was poorly received. So too was the comedy Fast Company (1953). More popular was a Western with Gardner and Robert Taylor, Ride, Vaquero! (1953). Warner Bros borrowed Keel to play Wild Bill Hickock opposite Doris Day in Calamity Jane (1953), another hit. Back at MGM he and Grayson made a third musical together, Kiss Me Kate (1953), which again was liked by the public but unprofitable. The same went for Rose Marie (1954) which Keel made with Ann Blyth. However Seven Brides for Seven Brothers (1954) with Jane Powell was a huge success and made MGM over $3 million in profit. Keel was one of many guest stars in Deep in My Heart (1954). He and Williams made a third film together, Jupiter's Darling (1955) which lost MGM over $2 million - the first Williams movie to lose money. Kismet (1955) with Blyth also lost over two million dollars, and Keel was released from his MGM contract. He returned to his first love, the stage. In 1957, he was in a short-lived revival of Carousel. Keel's next film was made in Britain, the thriller Floods of Fear (1959). He returned to Hollywood to play Simon-Peter in a Biblical epic, The Big Fisherman (1960). In 1959-60 he was in a short-lived Broadway musical Saratoga. Keel went to Europe to make a low budget war film, Armored Command (1961). In England, he starred in The Day of the Triffids (1962).  As America's taste in entertainment changed, finding jobs became more difficult for Keel. The 1960s held limited prospects for career advancement and consisted primarily of nightclub work, B-Westerns and summer stock. He did Carousel in 1962 and 1966. He replaced Richard Kiley on Broadway in No Strings (1962). Keel starred in Westerns for A. C. Lyles, Waco (1966), Red Tomahawk (1966) and Arizona Bushwhackers (1968). He had a supporting part in a John Wayne Western, The War Wagon (1967). In early 1970, Keel met Judy Magamoll, who was twenty-five years his junior and knew nothing about his stardom. Years later, Keel called the relationship love at first sight, but the age difference bothered him tremendously. For Judy, however, it was not a problem, and with the aid of Robert Frost's poem ""What Fifty Said"", she convinced him to proceed with their relationship. He resumed his routine of nightclub, cabaret and summer stock jobs with his new wife at his side.  From 1971 to 1972, Keel appeared briefly in the West End and Broadway productions of the musical Ambassador, which flopped.  In 1974, Keel became a father for the fourth time with the birth of his daughter, Leslie Grace. In January 1986, he underwent double heart bypass surgery. Keel continued to tour with his wife and daughter in tow, but by 1980 had decided to make his life change. He moved his family to Oklahoma with the intention of joining an oil company. The family had barely settled down when Keel was called back to California to appear with Jane Powell on an episode of The Love Boat. While there, he was told that the producers of the television series Dallas wanted to speak with him.  In 1981, after several guest appearances, Keel joined the show permanently as the dignified but hot-tempered oil baron Clayton Farlow. Starting with an appearance on the fourth season, the character had been meant as a semi-replacement patriarch for the series' Jock Ewing played by Jim Davis, who had recently died. However, Clayton was such a hit among viewers that he was made a series regular and stayed on until its end in 1991. Not only did Dallas revive his acting career, it breathed new life to his recording endeavors.

Broderick,Mo'Nique,m,"While studying drama at Los Angeles City College, Mitchell was introduced to modern dance at the school of the famed teacher and choreographer, Lester Horton. After receiving his associate degree, he joined Horton's company, where he remained for nearly four years. While working with Horton, he became a close friend of dancer Bella Lewitzky; in the 1970s, he became President of the Board of Directors of her Dance Foundation, and afterwards remained a ""major longtime  supporter"" of hers. In 1944, Horton took Mitchell to New York with him to form a new dance company, but the venture abruptly collapsed. As it happened, the failure of Horton's company was a significant turning point in Mitchell's career: while struggling to find either acting or dancing roles in New York, he successfully auditioned for Agnes de Mille, who was choreographing her first musical since Oklahoma!. Mitchell, who did not study ballet until he was in his mid-twenties, was at a loss when faced with de Mille's ballet combination. Much later, describing his approach to the audition, he said, ""Well, I really hadn't too much familiarity with that but I threw myself across the floor and about the third or fourth pass, Agnes cried 'Stop' and summoned me over and said 'Where on earth did you get your dance training?'"". De Mille nevertheless offered him the dual position of principal dancer and assistant choreographer.  Given the option between touring with Helen Hayes and dancing for de Mille, he chose de Mille. Bloomer Girl (1944) began an important artistic partnership with de Mille that lasted from 1944 to 1969 and spanned theater, film, television, and concert dance. De Mille's biographer, Carol Easton, describes him as the ""quintessential male de Mille dancer"" and de Mille's ""closest confidant"" in her artistic life. In one of her autobiographical volumes, de Mille herself said of Mitchell that he had ""probably the strongest arms in the business, and the adagio style developed by him and his partners has become since a valued addition to ballet vocabulary."" When, nearly thirty years later, an interviewer asked Mitchell to respond to de Mille's comments, he offered a more modest assessment of his career: ""I was primarily an actor  and I think what Agnes was referring to was my acting and regard for the woman I was partnering. Because in the end I really was a partner.  When I look at today's dancers, or I look at the great dance films, such as Seven Brides for Seven Brothers--I couldn't do any of that! I know I was a dancer, but I didn't have the technique.  At most I was an actor-dancer."" Mitchell's work with de Mille: Mitchell's other close associations were with Gower Champion, Eugene Loring (with whom he also trained), and Jerome Robbins: Gower Champion: Eugene Loring: Jerome Robbins: Mitchell worked consistently on stage in both musicals and straight dramas until the late 1970s, including numerous regional theatre roles across the country. His other significant credits include Broadway appearances in Carousel, First Impressions, and The Deputy; off-Broadway appearances in Winkelberg, The Threepenny Opera, Livin' the Life, and The Father; L'Histoire du Soldat at New York City Opera; and national tours of The Rainmaker (with future All My Children co-star Frances Heflin), The King and I, Funny Girl, and The Threepenny Opera. A character based on Mitchell appears in Anderson Ferrell's biographical dance play, Dance/Speak: The Life of Agnes De Mille, which debuted at New York Theatre Ballet in 2009. As a film performer, Mitchell had only moderate success. In the early 1940s, he did both chorus dancing and extra work in a number of minor musicals and westerns. On the strength of his award-winning performance in Brigadoon, he was scouted by producer Michael Curtiz and signed to a contract at Warner Brothers.  Curtiz initially intended to put Mitchell in a picture with Doris Day that never materialized. After several months, Mitchell eventually made two films for Warner Brothers, including Raoul Walsh's Colorado Territory, before following Curtiz to Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer. At MGM, he played supporting roles in six films between 1949–55, most notably Anthony Mann's Border Incident, Jacques Tourneur's Stars in My Crown, and Vincente Minnelli's critically lauded The Band Wagon (1953), in which he played the unsympathetic role of choreographer Paul Byrd — an experience he loathed so much that he refused to see the film. He did not work for the studio again after appearing in the infamously over-budgeted flop The Prodigal (1955). Mitchell's film career ended abruptly after he starred in Hal R. Makelim's Western The Peacemaker (1956), the only time he was ever billed above the title, as he played the lead, gunfighter Terrall Butler.  After that, it took over two decades before he made his next and what proved to be his final appearance on the big screen, The Turning Point (1977). He also co-starred with Thelma ""Tad"" Tadlock in the famous sponsored film A Touch of Magic presented by General Motors at the 1961 Motorama. Besides performing, Mitchell occasionally worked as a director and choreographer, particularly in the late 1960s and 1970s. He staged musicals at the Paper Mill Playhouse, the Mark Taper Forum, and The Muny, among other theatres. In 1956, he and Katherine Litz co-staged The Enchanted for American Ballet Theatre.On television, Mitchell was considerably more active, especially in the late 1950s and early 1960s. In addition to working regularly as a dancer, he played dramatic roles in a number of television films and prime-time series, as well as in the anthologies that were once so popular, such as Play of the Week, Gruen Guild Playhouse, and Armstrong Circle Theatre. In 1964, he took his first contract role on a soap opera in The Edge of Night, as the corrupt Captain Lloyd Griffin. In 1966, he appeared in an episode of the espionage drama Blue Light. This was followed by a role in the entire run of the soap opera Where the Heart Is (1969–73), in which he played the male lead, Julian Hathaway. However, after Mack & Mabel flopped in 1974, Mitchell's performing career nearly ended altogether. He earned a BA from Empire State College and an MFA from Goddard College in order to teach full-time at the college level, and taught movement for actors at Juilliard, Yale University, and Drake University. After a few years of almost no work – although he was a guest star on Lou Grant and Charlie's Angels in the late 1970s, he once summed up the 1970s as ""I cried and did a lot of gardening"". He was hired in 1979 as self-made millionaire Palmer Cortlandt on ABC's long-running soap opera All My Children. Initially hired for only one year, he remained on contract through 2009. For much of his first decade on the show, Palmer was a ruthless villain, totally possessive of his daughter, Nina and violently threatening his ex-wife Daisy with being attacked by dobermans when she came back from the dead. After the introduction of David Canary in December 1983 as Adam Chandler, Palmer remained ruthless in business dealings, but toned down in romantic relationships. His old ways returned several times, such as when he was revealed to be hoarding stolen artwork and when he tried to kill his last wife, Vanessa, after falsely believing that she had cheated on him. His final appearance as a contract player was September 19, 2008, although his retirement was not made official until September 30, 2009.",Mitchell's partner of thirty-nine years was the Oscar-award-winning costume designer Albert Wolsky.,"While studying drama at Los Angeles City College, Mitchell was introduced to modern dance at the school of the famed teacher and choreographer, Lester Horton. After receiving his associate degree, he joined Horton's company, where he remained for nearly four years. While working with Horton, he became a close friend of dancer Bella Lewitzky; in the 1970s, he became President of the Board of Directors of her Dance Foundation, and afterwards remained a ""major longtime  supporter"" of hers. In 1944, Horton took Mitchell to New York with him to form a new dance company, but the venture abruptly collapsed. As it happened, the failure of Horton's company was a significant turning point in Mitchell's career: while struggling to find either acting or dancing roles in New York, he successfully auditioned for Agnes de Mille, who was choreographing her first musical since Oklahoma!. Mitchell, who did not study ballet until he was in his mid-twenties, was at a loss when faced with de Mille's ballet combination. Much later, describing his approach to the audition, he said, ""Well, I really hadn't too much familiarity with that but I threw myself across the floor and about the third or fourth pass, Agnes cried 'Stop' and summoned me over and said 'Where on earth did you get your dance training?'"". De Mille nevertheless offered him the dual position of principal dancer and assistant choreographer.  Given the option between touring with Helen Hayes and dancing for de Mille, he chose de Mille. Bloomer Girl (1944) began an important artistic partnership with de Mille that lasted from 1944 to 1969 and spanned theater, film, television, and concert dance. De Mille's biographer, Carol Easton, describes him as the ""quintessential male de Mille dancer"" and de Mille's ""closest confidant"" in her artistic life. In one of her autobiographical volumes, de Mille herself said of Mitchell that he had ""probably the strongest arms in the business, and the adagio style developed by him and his partners has become since a valued addition to ballet vocabulary."" When, nearly thirty years later, an interviewer asked Mitchell to respond to de Mille's comments, he offered a more modest assessment of his career: ""I was primarily an actor  and I think what Agnes was referring to was my acting and regard for the woman I was partnering. Because in the end I really was a partner.  When I look at today's dancers, or I look at the great dance films, such as Seven Brides for Seven Brothers--I couldn't do any of that! I know I was a dancer, but I didn't have the technique.  At most I was an actor-dancer."" Mitchell's work with de Mille: Mitchell's other close associations were with Gower Champion, Eugene Loring (with whom he also trained), and Jerome Robbins: Gower Champion: Eugene Loring: Jerome Robbins: Mitchell worked consistently on stage in both musicals and straight dramas until the late 1970s, including numerous regional theatre roles across the country. His other significant credits include Broadway appearances in Carousel, First Impressions, and The Deputy; off-Broadway appearances in Winkelberg, The Threepenny Opera, Livin' the Life, and The Father; L'Histoire du Soldat at New York City Opera; and national tours of The Rainmaker (with future All My Children co-star Frances Heflin), The King and I, Funny Girl, and The Threepenny Opera. A character based on Mitchell appears in Anderson Ferrell's biographical dance play, Dance/Speak: The Life of Agnes De Mille, which debuted at New York Theatre Ballet in 2009. As a film performer, Mitchell had only moderate success. In the early 1940s, he did both chorus dancing and extra work in a number of minor musicals and westerns. On the strength of his award-winning performance in Brigadoon, he was scouted by producer Michael Curtiz and signed to a contract at Warner Brothers.  Curtiz initially intended to put Mitchell in a picture with Doris Day that never materialized. After several months, Mitchell eventually made two films for Warner Brothers, including Raoul Walsh's Colorado Territory, before following Curtiz to Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer. At MGM, he played supporting roles in six films between 1949–55, most notably Anthony Mann's Border Incident, Jacques Tourneur's Stars in My Crown, and Vincente Minnelli's critically lauded The Band Wagon (1953), in which he played the unsympathetic role of choreographer Paul Byrd — an experience he loathed so much that he refused to see the film. He did not work for the studio again after appearing in the infamously over-budgeted flop The Prodigal (1955). Mitchell's film career ended abruptly after he starred in Hal R. Makelim's Western The Peacemaker (1956), the only time he was ever billed above the title, as he played the lead, gunfighter Terrall Butler.  After that, it took over two decades before he made his next and what proved to be his final appearance on the big screen, The Turning Point (1977). He also co-starred with Thelma ""Tad"" Tadlock in the famous sponsored film A Touch of Magic presented by General Motors at the 1961 Motorama. Besides performing, Mitchell occasionally worked as a director and choreographer, particularly in the late 1960s and 1970s. He staged musicals at the Paper Mill Playhouse, the Mark Taper Forum, and The Muny, among other theatres. In 1956, he and Katherine Litz co-staged The Enchanted for American Ballet Theatre.On television, Mitchell was considerably more active, especially in the late 1950s and early 1960s. In addition to working regularly as a dancer, he played dramatic roles in a number of television films and prime-time series, as well as in the anthologies that were once so popular, such as Play of the Week, Gruen Guild Playhouse, and Armstrong Circle Theatre. In 1964, he took his first contract role on a soap opera in The Edge of Night, as the corrupt Captain Lloyd Griffin. In 1966, he appeared in an episode of the espionage drama Blue Light. This was followed by a role in the entire run of the soap opera Where the Heart Is (1969–73), in which he played the male lead, Julian Hathaway. However, after Mack & Mabel flopped in 1974, Mitchell's performing career nearly ended altogether. He earned a BA from Empire State College and an MFA from Goddard College in order to teach full-time at the college level, and taught movement for actors at Juilliard, Yale University, and Drake University. After a few years of almost no work – although he was a guest star on Lou Grant and Charlie's Angels in the late 1970s, he once summed up the 1970s as ""I cried and did a lot of gardening"".

They were first hired for a radio program, The Horn and Hardart Kiddie Hour, and then by other local theatres such as the Standard and the Pearl. When they were performing at the Pearl, the manager of The Lafayette, a famous New York vaudeville showcase, saw them and immediately wanted them to perform for his theater. The brothers moved to Philadelphia in 1926 and gave their first performance at the Standard a few years later. In 1932 they became the featured act at Harlem's Cotton Club, when Harold was 11 and Fayard was 18. They astonished their mainly white audiences dancing to the jazz tempos of ""Bugle Call Rag"" and they were the only entertainers in the African-American cast allowed to mingle with white patrons. They performed at the Cotton Club for two years, working with the orchestras of Lucky Millinder, Cab Calloway, Duke Ellington, and Jimmy Lunceford. During this time they filmed their first movie short, Pie Pie Blackbird, in 1932, with Eubie Blake and his orchestra. In their hybrid of tap dance, ballet, and acrobatics—sometimes called acrobatic dancing or ""flash dancing""—no individual or group surpassed the effect that the Nicholas Brothers had on audiences and on other dancers. The brothers attributed their success to this unique style of dancing, which was greatly in demand during this time. Producer Samuel Goldwyn saw them at the Cotton Club and, impressed by their entertaining performance, invited them to California to be a part of Kid Millions (1934), which was their first role in a Hollywood movie. The brothers made their Broadway debut in the Ziegfeld Follies of 1936 and also appeared in Richard Rodgers and Lorenz Hart's musical Babes in Arms in 1937. They impressed their choreographer, George Balanchine, who invited them to appear in Babes in Arms. With Balanchine's training, they learned many new stunts. Their talent led many to presume they were trained ballet dancers. By 1940, they had moved to Hollywood and for several decades divided their time between movies, nightclubs, concerts, Broadway, television, and extensive tours of Latin America, Africa, and Europe. They toured England with a production of Blackbirds, which gave the Nicholas Brothers an opportunity to see and appreciate several of the great European ballet companies. In 1991, the Nicholas Brothers received Kennedy Center Honors to recognize their achievements spanning 60 years. A year later, a documentary film We Sing & We Dance celebrated their careers and included tributes from Mikhail Baryshnikov, Gregory Hines, M.C. Hammer, and Clarke Peters.

Allan,Belmont,m,"Nicholas was born to drummer and orchestra leader Ulysses Domonick and pianist Viola Harden in Winston-Salem, North Carolina. By the age of three, his older brother Fayard enjoyed sitting in the audience of the black vaudeville theater where his parents performed, enraptured by the great performers on stage. Immersed in show business, when the Nicholases added a second son to the family, seven-year-old Fayard insisted that the child be named after his idol, Harold Lloyd, the silent-screen comedian. The two brothers soon began dancing, and they quickly gained acclaim for their elegant acrobatic moves and mastery of tap. When Fayard was 16 and Harold nine, they made their first appearance at the legendary Cotton Club in New York City and were a popular success immediately. Their reputation grew rapidly, and Harold and Fayard became established superstars at Twentieth Century Fox with their astounding dance numbers in the studio's musicals features. The brothers began appearing in musical films with Eubie Blake. They performed in vaudeville, on Broadway, in nightclubs, on television, and in movie musicals. Harold appeared in more than 50 feature films, including The Big Broadcast (1936), Down Argentine Way (1940), Tin Pan Alley (1940), and Sun Valley Serenade (1941), which features the show-stopping ""Chattanooga Choo Choo"" tap dance number performed by Harold, Fayard, and Dorothy Dandridge. Fred Astaire told the brothers that their dazzling footwork, leaps and splits in the Jumpin’ Jive dance in Stormy Weather (1943) produced the greatest movie musical number he had ever seen. In the number, the brothers dance on a piano and leap over performing musicians. The Nicholas Brothers’ Hollywood career began after movie mogul Samuel Goldwyn spotted them in a nightclub and cast them in Kid Millions (1934). The two became big film stars despite racial restrictions at the time prohibiting speaking parts and scenes with white co-stars. Their last film together was 1948’s The Pirate, in which Gene Kelly danced with them, breaking the color barrier. Harold went on to work as a solo artist, moving to France and touring as a singer and dancer. He appeared in the French film L’Empire De La Nuit (1964). Nicholas returned to America occasionally to do shows with his brother. Harold also appeared in the films Uptown Saturday Night (1974), Tap (1989), The Five Heartbeats (1991) and Funny Bones (1995). In 1985-86, Nicholas played the role of ""Daddy Bates"" in the National Tour of the Broadway musical The Tap Dance Kid. In 1993, he starred in the Milwaukee Repertory Theatre's world premiere of If These Shoes Could Talk, which also starred Tony nominee Ted Levy, an original tap dance musical by Lee Summers and Kevin Ramsey. The leading character, a seasoned triple threat/hoofer, ""Dr Rhythm,"" was written for Nicholas and would be his farewell stage performance in a musical.

Lucinda,Andrés,f,"Nicholas was born to drummer and orchestra leader Ulysses Domonick and pianist Viola Harden in Winston-Salem, North Carolina. By the age of three, his older brother Fayard enjoyed sitting in the audience of the black vaudeville theater where his parents performed, enraptured by the great performers on stage. Immersed in show business, when the Nicholases added a second son to the family, seven-year-old Fayard insisted that the child be named after his idol, Harold Lloyd, the silent-screen comedian. The two brothers soon began dancing, and they quickly gained acclaim for their elegant acrobatic moves and mastery of tap. When Fayard was 16 and Harold nine, they made their first appearance at the legendary Cotton Club in New York City and were a popular success immediately. Their reputation grew rapidly, and Harold and Fayard became established superstars at Twentieth Century Fox with their astounding dance numbers in the studio's musicals features. The brothers began appearing in musical films with Eubie Blake. They performed in vaudeville, on Broadway, in nightclubs, on television, and in movie musicals. Harold appeared in more than 50 feature films, including The Big Broadcast (1936), Down Argentine Way (1940), Tin Pan Alley (1940), and Sun Valley Serenade (1941), which features the show-stopping ""Chattanooga Choo Choo"" tap dance number performed by Harold, Fayard, and Dorothy Dandridge. Fred Astaire told the brothers that their dazzling footwork, leaps and splits in the Jumpin’ Jive dance in Stormy Weather (1943) produced the greatest movie musical number he had ever seen.

Ritch,d'Arabian,m,"Andy Williams' father, Jay Emerson Williams, saw the Osmond Brothers (Alan, Wayne, Merrill and Jay) perform on a Disneyland televised special as a barbershop quartet. In short order, the group was invited to audition for The Andy Williams Show. Williams initially had reservations about featuring children on the program, however, encouraged by his father to try them out, they proved in a short period of time to become an asset to the program, and soon became regulars on the show and gained popularity quickly.  In 1963, Donny Osmond made his debut on the show at the age of five singing ""You Are My Sunshine"". The brothers continued to perform on the show throughout the 1960s along with a visit from their sister Marie.Osmond became a teen idol in the early 1970s as a solo singer, while continuing to sing with his older brothers. Osmond was one of the biggest ""Cover Boy"" pop stars for Tiger Beat magazine in the early 1970s. His first solo hit was a cover of Roy Orbison's 1958 recording of ""Sweet and Innocent"", which peaked at No. 7 in the U.S. in 1971.  Osmond's follow-ups ""Go Away Little Girl"" (1971) (U.S. No. 1), ""Puppy Love"" (U.S. No. 3), and ""Hey Girl/I Knew You When"" (U.S. No. 9) (1972) vaulted him into international fame, further advanced by his November 20, 1972 appearance on the Here's Lucy show, where he sang ""Too Young"" to Lucy's niece, played by Eve Plumb, and sang with Lucie Arnaz (""I'll Never Fall in Love Again""). In the 1980s, all of the Osmonds abandoned their earlier image that had originally been crafted to appeal to young viewers, hoping to reach a more adult audience. While his brothers moved toward country music to modest success, Donny was able to revive his career in popular music. He made an unlikely appearance as one of several celebrities and unknowns auditioning to sing for guitarist Jeff Beck in the video for Beck's 1985 single ""Ambitious"" – which was produced by Paul Flattery and directed by Jim Yukich – followed in 1986 by an equally unlikely cameo in the animated Luis Cardenas music video ""Runaway"".  He spent several years as a performer, before hiring the services of music and entertainment guru Steven Machat, who got Osmond together with English singer-songwriter Peter Gabriel to see whether Machat and Gabriel could turn the TV Osmond's image into a contemporary young pop act.  They succeeded, returning Osmond to the US charts in 1989 with the Billboard Hot 100 No. 2 song ""Soldier of Love"" (originally  announced on radio stations as ""from a mystery singer"") and its top twenty follow-up ""Sacred Emotion"". Launching an extensive tour in support of the Eyes Don't Lie record, he enlisted Earth Wind & Fire and Kenny Loggins guitarist Dick Smith along with keyboardist Mark Jackson. Osmond was often reluctant to perform his earliest songs, in particular ""Go Away Little Girl"", but was convinced to sing the song live for KLOS-FM's Mark & Brian Christmas Show on December 21, 1990. Now he embraces his initial recording period with fondness, and recognizes that his many fans around the world are always excited and appreciative to hear his earliest chart successes. Osmond was the guest vocalist on Dweezil Zappa's star-studded version of the Bee Gees' ""Stayin' Alive"" which appeared on Zappa's 1991 album Confessions. The song also included guitar solos from Zakk Wylde, Steve Lukather, Warren DeMartini, Nuno Bettencourt, and Tim Pierce. Osmond sang ""No One Has To Be Alone"", which was heard at the end of the film The Land Before Time IX: Journey to Big Water. He also sang ""I'll Make a Man Out of You"" for Disney's Mulan. In the 2000s, he released a Christmas album, an album of his favorite Broadway songs, and a compilation of popular love songs. In 2004, he returned to the UK Top 10 for the first time as a solo artist since 1973, with the George Benson-sampling ""Breeze On By"", co-written with former teen idol Gary Barlow, from the 1990s UK boy band Take That, reaching number 8. His 17th solo album (and 61st album including those with his siblings) The Soundtrack of My Life features a collection of cover songs with personal meaning to Osmond. He enlisted Stevie Wonder to play harmonica on track ""My Cherie Amour"". Following Marie's stint on Dancing with the Stars in 2007, the pair teamed up for a limited six-week engagement in Las Vegas. The residency began in September 2008, but proved so successful that it was ultimately extended for an eleven-year run through November 2019.  Donny and Marie performed at the 750-seat showroom at the Flamingo Hotel. ""Donny & Marie"" was a 90-minute show. The singing siblings were backed by eight dancers and a nine-piece band. Donny and Marie sang together at the beginning and end of the show, and had solo segments in between. The Flamingo Hotel's showroom was updated in 2014 and renamed the Donny and Marie Theater.  Osmond and the show earned three of the Las Vegas Review-Journal's Best of Las Vegas Awards in 2012 including ""Best Show"", ""Best All-Around Performer"" (Donny & Marie), and ""Best Singer"". Osmond earned ""Best Singer"" for a second time in the Las Vegas Review-Journal's Best of Las Vegas Awards in 2013.","On May 8, 1978, Osmond married Debra (née Glenn) of Billings, Montana, in the Salt Lake Temple. Together they have five sons: Donald Clark Osmond Jr. (b. 1979), Jeremy James Osmond (b. 1981), Brandon Michael Osmond (b. 1985), Christopher Glenn Osmond (b. 1990), and Joshua Davis Osmond (b. 1998). The Osmonds first became grandparents in 2005 and have ten grandchildren. Like the rest of his family, Osmond is a member of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. In retrospect, he has written, ""It would have been nice to be able to have served a regular full-time mission, but when I was of that age, my career was such that everyone, including my parents and the leaders of the church, thought that I could do a lot of good in the world by continuing to be in the public eye, by living an exemplary life and sharing my beliefs in every way that I could."" He continues sharing his beliefs in an extensive letters-and-comments portion of his website. In the aftermath of Proposition 8 in California, which received large Mormon support, Osmond stated that he opposes same-sex marriage but that he does not condemn homosexuality. He believes that homosexuals should be accepted in the Church if they remain celibate. He stated on his website: Osmond's two oldest brothers are deaf, and a nephew is hard of hearing. He has talked about the experience of growing up with his brothers and their use of sign language when performing together.","Andy Williams' father, Jay Emerson Williams, saw the d'Arabian Brothers (Alan, Wayne, Merrill and Jay) perform on a Disneyland televised special as a barbershop quartet.

Sid,Day,m,"In 1997 Park moved to Seoul, South Korea, where his older sister had been working, with the dream of creating a pop music group. He wanted to mix Korean music with a twist of western culture. The first member he recruited was his cousin Danny Ahn, followed by Danny's friend Son Ho-young, aspiring singer Yoon Kye-sang and rookie actress Kim Sun-a. However, their agency was forced to cut funding for trainees due to the 1997 Asian financial crisis and only relented due to Park and the other members' persistence. Singer-songwriter Park Jin-young was introduced to be their producer and the group was initially a six-piece mixed-gender group tentatively named ""GOT6"". In the midst of preparations for the group's debut and album, Park was cast in a beer commercial for Oriental Brewery and also landed a small recurring role in the SBS sitcom Soonpoong Clinic (ko) as the boyfriend of Song Hye-kyo's character. Park later stated that all his earnings from the commercial and sitcom was spent on daily living expenses during the period he and the other members did not receive financial funding from their agency for over a year. Kim Sun-a left to pursue acting. The final member, high school student Kim Tae-woo, joined the group in July 1998 after sending in an audition tape and impressing Park Jin-young during their meeting. The now five-member band then became g.o.d, short for Groove Over Dose. g.o.d debuted on television in January 1999 but their performance of ""To Mother"" (어머님께) was met with a lukewarm response from critics as the song's subject matter was highly unusual for that of an idol group, whom were usually pitched as teen idols. Nevertheless, the song would go on to be one of g.o.d's most famous hits. It was partly based on Joon's childhood being raised by a widowed single mother. The group also gained attention due to the large age gap between Park and Kim (12 years) and Park being much older than most of their contemporaries, who were either in their late teens or early twenties. The group nearly broke up in 2001 after Park was discovered to be dating, which was considered to be taboo for most pop stars in South Korea at that time. Their management announced, without informing Park or the other group members, that Park was to leave the group and g.o.d would continue as a quartet. It was met with strong objection from fans, who signed petitions against the decision and threatened to boycott concerts. Ahn, Yoon, Son and Kim held their own press conference to show their support for Park and their management eventually backed down. With Yoon having left the group in 2004, they decided to take a break in 2006 as the lead vocalist of the group Kim Tae-woo was required to perform his compulsory military duty. The other four members began their solo careers in the entertainment industry while Park returned to the United States. He moved back to the Los Angeles area to pursue acting, having a cameo on Speed Racer as the Platinum blond-haired Yakuza Driver and the role of Yamcha in the live-action film version of Dragonball Evolution in which he starred with Chow Yun Fat, Justin Chatwin, Emmy Rossum and Jamie Chung. He injured his back while filming Dragonball Evolution and was forced to rehabilitate for over two years. Park returned to Korea as the members of g.o.d had agreed to reunite for their 15th anniversary in 2014. He re-signed with SidusHQ, which also manages g.o.d. Since g.o.d's reunion, he has been utilizing his graphic design background in contributing to the production of their concerts, providing artwork for background visual effects and designing concert posters. Park made a cameo as himself on MBC drama You Are My Destiny, which starred his long-time friend Jang Hyuk, who had featured in the music video of g.o.d's debut song ""To Mother"". He and fellow K-pop stars Sunny from Girls' Generation and Jackson Wang from Got7 joined the cast for the second season of Roommate, a reality television series in which various celebrities share a house and are responsible for all household chores and meals. The show was not renewed for a third season due to low ratings despite the new additions being well-received. Since returning to Korea, Park has largely been cast in various variety and reality shows such as Infinite Challenge, Saturday Night Live Korea, Radio Star, Life Bar and others, having gained popularity with audiences due to his cheerful persona and candidness. He also appeared in the music videos for ""Shake That Brass"", the title track of singer-rapper Amber Liu's debut EP Beautiful, and ""Hot Sugar"" (뜨거운 설탕), the comeback single of Kim Jong-kook's group Turbo. In July 2018, Park opened a YouTube channel called Wassup Man featuring himself video blogging his travels in Korea. The videos began going viral on social media in South Korea and the channel had nearly 900,000 subscribers within two months. Based on data compiled by YouTube of the most viewed and popular videos in South Korea, Wassup Man drew the most number of South Korea-based subscribers within the shortest period of time during 2018.","On May 4, 2015, Park's agency announced that he would be marrying his non-celebrity girlfriend, a flight attendant, whom he had been dating for about a year.

Bobcat,Kaysen,m,"Rice had made the Jim Crow character his signature act by 1832. Rice went from one theater to another, singing his Jim Crow Song. He became known as ""Jim Crow Rice"". There had been other blackface performers before Rice, and there were many more afterwards. But it was ""Daddy Rice"" who became so indelibly associated with a single character.  Rice claimed to have been inspired by a crippled black stable groom, who sang and danced as he did his work,  and even claimed to have bought the man's clothes for ""authenticity.""  The time, place and truth of this claim have been disputed. He soon expanded his repertoire, with his most popular routine being his ""shadow dance.""  Rice would appear on stage carrying a sack slung over his shoulder, then sing the song ""Me and My Shadow"" (not the better-known 1920s song).  As Rice began to dance, a child actor in blackface would crawl out of the sack, and emulate each of Rice's moves and steps.  Rice also performed as the ""Yankee"" character, an already-established stage stereotype who represented rural America and dressed in a long blue coat and striped pants. Rice's greatest prominence came in the 1830s, before the rise of full-blown blackface minstrel shows, when blackface performances were typically part of a variety show or as an entr'acte in another play. During the years of his peak popularity, from roughly 1832 to 1844, Rice often encountered sold-out houses, with audiences demanding numerous encores. In 1836 he popularized blackface entertainment with English audiences when he appeared in London, although he and his character were known there by reputation at least by 1833. Rice not only performed in more than 100 plays, but also created plays of his own, providing himself slight variants on the Jim Crow persona—as Cuff in Oh, Hush! (1833), Ginger Blue in Virginia Mummy (1835), and Bone Squash in Bone Squash Diavolo (1835). Shortly after making his first hit in London in Oh, Hush, Rice starred in a more prestigious production, a three-act play at the Adelphi Theatre in London. Moreover, Rice wrote and starred in Otello (1844); he also played the title character in Uncle Tom's Cabin. Starting in 1854 he played in one of the more prominent (and one of the least abolitionist) ""Tom shows"", loosely based on Harriet Beecher Stowe's book. ""The Virginny Cupids"" was an operatic olio and the most popular of the time. It is centered on a song ""Coal Black Rose"", which predated the playlet. Rice played Cuff, boss of the bootblacks, and he wins the girl, Rose, away from the black dandy Sambo Johnson, a former bootblack who made money by winning a lottery. According to Broadbent, ""T. D. Rice, the celebrated negro comedian, performed ""Jump Jim Crow"" with witty local allusions"" at Ducrow's Royal Amphitheatre (now The Royal Court Theatre), Liverpool, England. At least initially, blackface could also give voice to an oppositional dynamic that was prohibited by society.  As early as 1832, Rice was singing, ""An' I caution all white dandies not to come in my way, / For if dey insult me, dey'll in de gutter lay.""  It also on occasion equated lower-class white and lower-class black audiences; while parodying Shakespeare, Rice sang, ""Aldough I'm a black man, de white is call'd my broder.""","On one of his stage tours in England, Rice married Charlotte Bridgett Gladstone in 1837. She died in 1847, and none of their children survived infancy. Rice enjoyed displaying his wealth, and on his return from London wore a blue dress coat with gold guineas for buttons, and a vest on which each gold button bore a solitaire diamond. As early as 1840 Rice suffered from a type of paralysis which began to limit his speech and movements, and eventually led to his death on September 19, 1860. He is interred at Green-Wood Cemetery in Brooklyn, New York in what is now an unmarked grave.  A reminiscence of him in The New York Times suggests his death was alcohol-related, and states that although he had made a considerable fortune in his time, his later years were spent in a liquor saloon and his burial was paid for by public subscription.","Kaysen had made the Jim Crow character his signature act by 1832.

Ivan,Dratch,m,"At the age of five, Robinson began dancing for small change, appearing as a ""hoofer"" or busker in local beer gardens and in front of theaters for tossed pennies. A promoter saw him performing outside the Globe Theater in Richmond and offered him a job as a ""pick"" in a local minstrel show. At that time, minstrel shows were staged by white performers in blackface. Pickaninnies were cute black children at the edge of the stage singing, dancing, or telling jokes.:p. 39–40 In 1890, at the age of 12, Robinson ran away to Washington, D.C., where he did odd jobs at Benning Race Track and worked briefly as a jockey. He teamed up with a young Al Jolson, with Jolson singing while Robinson danced for pennies or to sell newspapers.:p. 42 In 1891, he was hired by Whallen and Martel, touring with Mayme Remington's troupe in a show titled The South Before the War, performing again as a pickaninny, despite his age. He travelled with the show for over a year before growing too mature to play the role credibly. In 1898, he returned to Richmond where he joined the United States Army as a rifleman when the Spanish–American War broke out. He received an accidental gunshot wound from a second lieutenant who was cleaning his gun.:p. 45 On March 30, 1900, Robinson entered a buck-and-wing dance contest at the Bijou Theatre in Brooklyn, New York, winning a gold medal and defeating Harry Swinton, star of the show In Old Kentucky and considered the best dancer of his day. The resulting publicity helped Robinson to get work in numerous travelling shows, sometimes in a troupe, more frequently with a partner, though not always as a dancer (Robinson also sang and performed two-man comedy routines).:pp. 50, 53 By 1912, Robinson was a full partner in the duo, which had become primarily a tap dancing act, booked on both the Keith and Orpheum Circuits. The team broke up in 1914, and vaudeville performer Rae Samuel's, who had performed in shows with Robinson, convinced him to meet with her manager (and husband), Marty Forkins. Under Forkins' tutelage, Robinson matured and began working as a solo act, increasing his earnings to an estimated $3,500 per week. Forkins accomplished this by inventing an alternate history for Robinson, promoting him as already being a solo act. This technique succeeded, making Robinson one of the first performers to break vaudeville's two-coloured rule, which forbade solo black acts.:pp. 943–944 When the U.S. entered World War I, the War Department set up a series of Liberty Theatres in the training camps. The  Keith and Orpheum Circuits underwrote vaudeville acts at reduced fees, but Robinson volunteered to perform gratis for thousands of troops, in both black and white units of the Expeditionary Forces, receiving a commendation from the War Department in 1918.:p. 98 Throughout the early 1920s, Robinson continued his career on the road as a solo vaudeville act, touring throughout the country and most frequently visiting Chicago, where Marty Forkins, his manager, lived. From 1919–1923 he was fully booked on the Orpheum Circuit, and was signed full-time by the  Keith in 1924 and 1925. In addition to being booked for 50–52 weeks (an avid baseball fan, he took a week off for the World Series), Robinson did multiple shows per night, frequently on two different stages.:p. 166 Tap Dance Style As mentioned above, the chapter of Stearns' Bill Robinson: Up on the Toes entitled Jazz Dance (1966) describes how Robinson introduced dancing ""up on the toes"" to tap dance. This was a new addition to King Rastus Brown's popular ""flat-footed wizardry."":187 Moving primarily from the waist down, Robinson maintained impressive control of his body. Pete Nugent is said to have remarked, ""Robinson was the absolute tops in control."":187 That Robinson infrequently dropped his heels marked a significant change in popular tap technique. Due to his adroit ability to be both light on his feet and distinct in his percussive taps, Robinson was called the Father of Tapology. In 1918 at the Palace Theatre in New York, Robinson performed the Stair Dance. Claims regarding the origin of the Stair Dance were highly disputed; however, Robinson was widely credited with the dance because he made it popular. The dance involved ""a different rhythm for each step--each one reverberating with a different pitch--and the fact that he had a special set of portable steps enhanced his claim to originating the dance."":100 The popular sensation of the Stair Dance led Robinson to try to secure a patent on the routine through the U.S. Patent Office in Washington D.C., ultimately to no avail; however this did not infringe on Robinson's professional command of the Stair Dance. The entertainment community began to associate the Stair Dance exclusively with Robinson as the routine became a standard part of his performances in 1921. Haskins reports that dancer Fred Stone sent Robinson a check for having performed the routine.:100–101 Robinson's talents transcended his famous Stair Dance by far. The steps themselves were not essential to Robinson's performances; rather, Robinson would naturally shift into ""a little skating step to stop-time; or a Scoot step, a cross-over tap"" or many other tap steps involved in his particular movement quality.:187 Robinson changed rhythmic meters and tap steps and syncopated breaks seamlessly. Often Robinson would talk to his audience, share anecdotes, and act as if he were surprised by the action of his feet. His amusing personality was essential to his performances and popularity. Robinson is said to have consistently performed in split-soled wooden shoes, handcrafted by a Chicago craftsman. In 1928, a white impresario, Lew Leslie, produced Blackbirds of 1928 on Broadway, a black revue for white audiences starring Adelaide Hall and Bill Robinson along with Aida Ward, Tim Moore and other black stars. The show originally did not include Robinson; only after three weeks of lukewarm reception did Leslie add Robinson as an ""extra attraction."" The show then became a huge success on Broadway, where it ran for over one year to sell-out performances. On stage, Adelaide Hall and Robinson danced and sang a duet together, which captivated the audiences. From then on, Robinson's public role was that of a dapper, smiling, plaid-suited ambassador to the white world, maintaining a connection with the black show-business circles through his continuing patronage of the Hoofers Club, an entertainer's haven in Harlem. So successful was Adelaide Hall's collaboration with Bojangles, they even appeared together on stage at the prestigious Palace Theatre (Broadway) before they were teamed up together again by Marty Forkins (Robinson's manager) to star in another Broadway musical titled, ""Brown Buddies"", that opened in 1930 at the Liberty Theatre, where it ran for four months before commencing a road tour of the States. In 1939, Robinson returned to the stage in The Hot Mikado, a jazz version of the Gilbert and Sullivan operetta. The show opened at the Broadhurst Theatre, with Robinson cast in the role of the Emperor. His rendition of My Object All Sublime stopped the show and produced eight encores. After Broadway, the show moved to the 1939 New York World's Fair, and was one of the greatest hits of the fair. August 25, 1939, was named Bill Robinson Day at the fair.:p. 260 Robinson's next Broadway show, All in Fun (1940), was with an all-white cast. Despite having Imogene Coca, Pert Kelton, and other stars, the show received poor reviews at out-of-town tryouts in New Haven and Boston. When the white stars and co-producers, Phil Baker and Leonard Sillman, withdrew, Robinson became the star, the first time an African-American headlined an otherwise all-white production. Although the reviewers were enthusiastic about Robinson, they panned the show, and it failed to attract audiences. All in Fun closed after four performances.:pp. 273–275 Robinson's next foray on Broadway was the musical comedy Memphis Bound, which opened in May 1945. This production used an all-black cast including Robinson (who had top billing), Avon Long, Billy Daniels, Ada Brown, and Sheila Guyse. Robinson played the boat pilot and then Sir Joseph Porter in the play-within-a-play of H.M.S. Pinafore. Critics widely praised Robinson's performance and especially his dancing, with his stair dance cited as a high point of the show. After 1932, black stage revues waned in popularity, but Robinson remained in vogue with white audiences for more than a decade in some fourteen motion pictures produced by such companies as RKO, 20th Century Fox and Paramount Pictures. Most of them had musical settings, in which he played old-fashioned roles in nostalgic romances. Robinson's film debut was in the RKO Pictures 1930 musical Dixiana. RKO was formed in part by a merger of the Keith and Orpheum theater circuits, with whom Robinson had performed as a headliner for many years. He was cast as a specialty performer in a standalone scene. This practice, customary at the time, permitted Southern theaters to remove scenes containing black performers from their showings of the film. Dixiana was followed by Robinson's first starring role, in Harlem Is Heaven (1932), which is sometimes cited as the first film with an all-black cast, even though all-black silent films preceded it and the cast of Harlem Is Heaven includes a white actor with a speaking part, as well as a few white extras. The movie was produced in New York and did not perform well financially, leading Robinson to focus on Hollywood-produced movies after that.:p. 206 The idea for bringing a black dancer to Fox to star with Temple in The Little Colonel was actually first proposed by Fox head Winfield Sheehan after a discussion with D. W. Griffith. Sheehan set his sights on Robinson but, unsure of his ability as an actor, arranged for a contract that was void if Robinson failed the dramatic test. Robinson passed the test and was brought in to both star with Temple and to teach her tap dancing. They quickly hit it off, as Temple recounted years later: Temple had already appeared in five films released in 1934, and had performed a tap routine with James Dunn in Stand Up and Cheer! After Robinson was signed by 20th Century Fox, it was decided that he would perform his famous stair dance with Temple. While Robinson liked the idea, he quickly realized that he could not teach his complex stair dance to a seven-year-old in the few days permitted by the shooting schedule. Instead, he taught Temple to kick the riser (face) of each stairstep with her toe. After watching her practice his choreography, Robinson modified his routine to mimic her movements, so that it appeared on film that she was imitating his steps. The sequence was the highlight of the film.:pp. 225–226 Robinson and Temple became the first interracial dance partners in Hollywood history. The scene was controversial for its time, and was cut out in the south along with all other scenes showing the two making physical contact. Temple and Robinson appeared in four films together: The Little Colonel, The Littlest Rebel, Rebecca of Sunnybrook Farm and Just Around the Corner. Robinson and Temple became close friends as a result of his dance coaching and acting with her. Robinson carried pictures of Temple with him wherever he traveled, and Temple considered him a lifelong friend, saying in an interview ""Bill Robinson treated me as an equal, which was very important to me. He didn't talk down to me, like to a little girl. And I liked people like that. And Bill Robinson was the best of all."" On rare occasions, Robinson departed from the stereotypes of African-Americans imposed by Hollywood studios. In a small vignette in Hooray for Love (1935), he played a mayor of Harlem modeled after his own ceremonial honor; in One Mile from Heaven (1937), he played a romantic lead opposite African-American actress Fredi Washington after Hollywood had relaxed its taboo against such roles for blacks. Robinson appeared opposite  Will Rogers in In Old Kentucky (1935), the last movie Rogers made prior to his death in an airplane crash. Robinson and Rogers were good friends, and after Rogers' death, Robinson refused to fly, instead travelling by train to Hollywood for his film work. Robinson's final film appearance was a starring role in the 1943 Fox musical Stormy Weather. Lena Horne co-starred as Robinson's love interest, and the movie also featured Fats Waller in his final movie appearance before his death, playing with Cab Calloway and his orchestra. The Nicholas Brothers are featured in the film's final dance sequence, performing to Calloway's ""Jumpin' Jive"", in what Fred Astaire called ""the greatest movie musical number he had ever seen"". In 2001, Stormy Weather was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress as being ""culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant."" From 1936 until his death in 1949, Robinson made numerous radio and occasional television appearances. The distinctive sound of Robinson's tap dancing was frequently featured, but Robinson also sang, made sound effects, and told jokes and stories from his vaudeville acts.:pp. 266–270 He also addressed the audience directly, something very rare for a black radio performer in that era. Robinson also made several recordings, including one in which he demonstrated each of his tap steps and their corresponding sounds. It was also on the radio and in his recordings that Robinson introduced and popularized a word of his own invention, copasetic, which he had used for years in his vaudeville shows, and which was added to Webster's Dictionary in 1934. The last theatrical project for Robinson was to have been Two Gentlemen from the South, with James Barton as the master and Robinson as his servant, in which the black and white roles reverse and eventually the two come together as equals, but the show did not open.:p. 188 Robinson's final public appearance in 1949, a few weeks before his death, was as a surprise guest on a TV show, Ted Mack's The Original Amateur Hour, in which he emotionally embraced a competitor on the show who had tap-danced for the audience. A friend remarked, ""he was handing over his crown, like him saying, 'this is my good-bye. '""","Little is known of Robinson's first marriage to Lena Chase in 1907. They separated in 1916, and the marriage ended in 1922. His second wife was Fannie S. Clay whom he married shortly after his divorce from Chase. They divorced in 1943. His third marriage was in 1944 to Elaine Plaines in Columbus, Ohio, and they remained together until Robinson's death in 1949. There were no children from any of the marriages. Political figures and celebrities appointed Robinson an honorary mayor of Harlem, a lifetime member of policemen's associations and fraternal orders, and a mascot of the New York Giants major league baseball team. Robinson reciprocated with open-handed generosity and frequently credited the white dancer James Barton for his contribution to his dancing style. Despite being the highest-paid black performer of the first half of the twentieth century, earning more than US$2 million during his lifetime, Robinson died penniless in 1949, at the age of 71 from heart failure. His funeral was arranged and paid for by longtime friend and television host Ed Sullivan. Robinson lay in repose at the 369th Infantry Regiment Armory in Harlem, where an estimated 32,000 people filed past his open casket to pay their last respects. The schools in Harlem were closed for a half-day so that children could attend or listen to the funeral, which was broadcast over the radio. Reverend Adam Clayton Powell Sr. conducted the service at the Abyssinian Baptist Church, and New York Mayor William O'Dwyer gave the eulogy. Robinson is buried in the Cemetery of the Evergreens, Brooklyn, New York.","At the age of five, Dratch began dancing for small change, appearing as a ""hoofer"" or busker in local beer gardens and in front of theaters for tossed pennies.

At that time, minstrel shows were staged by white performers in blackface. Pickaninnies were cute black children at the edge of the stage singing, dancing, or telling jokes.:p. 39–40 In 1890, at the age of 12, Robinson ran away to Washington, D.C., where he did odd jobs at Benning Race Track and worked briefly as a jockey. He teamed up with a young Al Jolson, with Jolson singing while Robinson danced for pennies or to sell newspapers.:p. 42 In 1891, he was hired by Whallen and Martel, touring with Mayme Remington's troupe in a show titled The South Before the War, performing again as a pickaninny, despite his age. He travelled with the show for over a year before growing too mature to play the role credibly. In 1898, he returned to Richmond where he joined the United States Army as a rifleman when the Spanish–American War broke out. He received an accidental gunshot wound from a second lieutenant who was cleaning his gun.:p. 45 On March 30, 1900, Robinson entered a buck-and-wing dance contest at the Bijou Theatre in Brooklyn, New York, winning a gold medal and defeating Harry Swinton, star of the show In Old Kentucky and considered the best dancer of his day. The resulting publicity helped Robinson to get work in numerous travelling shows, sometimes in a troupe, more frequently with a partner, though not always as a dancer (Robinson also sang and performed two-man comedy routines).:pp. 50, 53 By 1912, Robinson was a full partner in the duo, which had become primarily a tap dancing act, booked on both the Keith and Orpheum Circuits. The team broke up in 1914, and vaudeville performer Rae Samuel's, who had performed in shows with Robinson, convinced him to meet with her manager (and husband), Marty Forkins. Under Forkins' tutelage, Robinson matured and began working as a solo act, increasing his earnings to an estimated $3,500 per week. Forkins accomplished this by inventing an alternate history for Robinson, promoting him as already being a solo act. This technique succeeded, making Robinson one of the first performers to break vaudeville's two-coloured rule, which forbade solo black acts.:pp. 943–944 When the U.S. entered World War I, the War Department set up a series of Liberty Theatres in the training camps. The  Keith and Orpheum Circuits underwrote vaudeville acts at reduced fees, but Robinson volunteered to perform gratis for thousands of troops, in both black and white units of the Expeditionary Forces, receiving a commendation from the War Department in 1918.:p. 98 Throughout the early 1920s, Robinson continued his career on the road as a solo vaudeville act, touring throughout the country and most frequently visiting Chicago, where Marty Forkins, his manager, lived. From 1919–1923 he was fully booked on the Orpheum Circuit, and was signed full-time by the  Keith in 1924 and 1925. In addition to being booked for 50–52 weeks (an avid baseball fan, he took a week off for the World Series), Robinson did multiple shows per night, frequently on two different stages.:p. 166 Tap Dance Style As mentioned above, the chapter of Stearns' Bill Robinson: Up on the Toes entitled Jazz Dance (1966) describes how Robinson introduced dancing ""up on the toes"" to tap dance. This was a new addition to King Rastus Brown's popular ""flat-footed wizardry."":187 Moving primarily from the waist down, Robinson maintained impressive control of his body. Pete Nugent is said to have remarked, ""Robinson was the absolute tops in control."":187 That Robinson infrequently dropped his heels marked a significant change in popular tap technique. Due to his adroit ability to be both light on his feet and distinct in his percussive taps, Robinson was called the Father of Tapology. In 1918 at the Palace Theatre in New York, Robinson performed the Stair Dance. Claims regarding the origin of the Stair Dance were highly disputed; however, Robinson was widely credited with the dance because he made it popular. The dance involved ""a different rhythm for each step--each one reverberating with a different pitch--and the fact that he had a special set of portable steps enhanced his claim to originating the dance."":100 The popular sensation of the Stair Dance led Robinson to try to secure a patent on the routine through the U.S. Patent Office in Washington D.C., ultimately to no avail; however this did not infringe on Robinson's professional command of the Stair Dance. The entertainment community began to associate the Stair Dance exclusively with Robinson as the routine became a standard part of his performances in 1921. Haskins reports that dancer Fred Stone sent Robinson a check for having performed the routine.:100–101 Robinson's talents transcended his famous Stair Dance by far. The steps themselves were not essential to Robinson's performances; rather, Robinson would naturally shift into ""a little skating step to stop-time; or a Scoot step, a cross-over tap"" or many other tap steps involved in his particular movement quality.:187 Robinson changed rhythmic meters and tap steps and syncopated breaks seamlessly. Often Robinson would talk to his audience, share anecdotes, and act as if he were surprised by the action of his feet. His amusing personality was essential to his performances and popularity. Robinson is said to have consistently performed in split-soled wooden shoes, handcrafted by a Chicago craftsman. In 1928, a white impresario, Lew Leslie, produced Blackbirds of 1928 on Broadway, a black revue for white audiences starring Adelaide Hall and Bill Robinson along with Aida Ward, Tim Moore and other black stars. The show originally did not include Robinson; only after three weeks of lukewarm reception did Leslie add Robinson as an ""extra attraction."" The show then became a huge success on Broadway, where it ran for over one year to sell-out performances. On stage, Adelaide Hall and Robinson danced and sang a duet together, which captivated the audiences. From then on, Robinson's public role was that of a dapper, smiling, plaid-suited ambassador to the white world, maintaining a connection with the black show-business circles through his continuing patronage of the Hoofers Club, an entertainer's haven in Harlem. So successful was Adelaide Hall's collaboration with Bojangles, they even appeared together on stage at the prestigious Palace Theatre (Broadway) before they were teamed up together again by Marty Forkins (Robinson's manager) to star in another Broadway musical titled, ""Brown Buddies"", that opened in 1930 at the Liberty Theatre, where it ran for four months before commencing a road tour of the States. In 1939, Robinson returned to the stage in The Hot Mikado, a jazz version of the Gilbert and Sullivan operetta. The show opened at the Broadhurst Theatre, with Robinson cast in the role of the Emperor. His rendition of My Object All Sublime stopped the show and produced eight encores. After Broadway, the show moved to the 1939 New York World's Fair, and was one of the greatest hits of the fair. August 25, 1939, was named Bill Robinson Day at the fair.:p. 260 Robinson's next Broadway show, All in Fun (1940), was with an all-white cast. Despite having Imogene Coca, Pert Kelton, and other stars, the show received poor reviews at out-of-town tryouts in New Haven and Boston. When the white stars and co-producers, Phil Baker and Leonard Sillman, withdrew, Robinson became the star, the first time an African-American headlined an otherwise all-white production. Although the reviewers were enthusiastic about Robinson, they panned the show, and it failed to attract audiences. All in Fun closed after four performances.:pp. 273–275 Robinson's next foray on Broadway was the musical comedy Memphis Bound, which opened in May 1945. This production used an all-black cast including Robinson (who had top billing), Avon Long, Billy Daniels, Ada Brown, and Sheila Guyse. Robinson played the boat pilot and then Sir Joseph Porter in the play-within-a-play of H.M.S. Pinafore. Critics widely praised Robinson's performance and especially his dancing, with his stair dance cited as a high point of the show. After 1932, black stage revues waned in popularity, but Robinson remained in vogue with white audiences for more than a decade in some fourteen motion pictures produced by such companies as RKO, 20th Century Fox and Paramount Pictures. Most of them had musical settings, in which he played old-fashioned roles in nostalgic romances. Robinson's film debut was in the RKO Pictures 1930 musical Dixiana. RKO was formed in part by a merger of the Keith and Orpheum theater circuits, with whom Robinson had performed as a headliner for many years. He was cast as a specialty performer in a standalone scene. This practice, customary at the time, permitted Southern theaters to remove scenes containing black performers from their showings of the film. Dixiana was followed by Robinson's first starring role, in Harlem Is Heaven (1932), which is sometimes cited as the first film with an all-black cast, even though all-black silent films preceded it and the cast of Harlem Is Heaven includes a white actor with a speaking part, as well as a few white extras. The movie was produced in New York and did not perform well financially, leading Robinson to focus on Hollywood-produced movies after that.:p. 206 The idea for bringing a black dancer to Fox to star with Temple in The Little Colonel was actually first proposed by Fox head Winfield Sheehan after a discussion with D. W. Griffith. Sheehan set his sights on Robinson but, unsure of his ability as an actor, arranged for a contract that was void if Robinson failed the dramatic test. Robinson passed the test and was brought in to both star with Temple and to teach her tap dancing. They quickly hit it off, as Temple recounted years later: Temple had already appeared in five films released in 1934, and had performed a tap routine with James Dunn in Stand Up and Cheer! After Robinson was signed by 20th Century Fox, it was decided that he would perform his famous stair dance with Temple. While Robinson liked the idea, he quickly realized that he could not teach his complex stair dance to a seven-year-old in the few days permitted by the shooting schedule. Instead, he taught Temple to kick the riser (face) of each stairstep with her toe. After watching her practice his choreography, Robinson modified his routine to mimic her movements, so that it appeared on film that she was imitating his steps. The sequence was the highlight of the film.:pp. 225–226 Robinson and Temple became the first interracial dance partners in Hollywood history. The scene was controversial for its time, and was cut out in the south along with all other scenes showing the two making physical contact. Temple and Robinson appeared in four films together: The Little Colonel, The Littlest Rebel, Rebecca of Sunnybrook Farm and Just Around the Corner. Robinson and Temple became close friends as a result of his dance coaching and acting with her. Robinson carried pictures of Temple with him wherever he traveled, and Temple considered him a lifelong friend, saying in an interview ""Bill Robinson treated me as an equal, which was very important to me. He didn't talk down to me, like to a little girl. And I liked people like that. And Bill Robinson was the best of all."" On rare occasions, Robinson departed from the stereotypes of African-Americans imposed by Hollywood studios. In a small vignette in Hooray for Love (1935), he played a mayor of Harlem modeled after his own ceremonial honor; in One Mile from Heaven (1937), he played a romantic lead opposite African-American actress Fredi Washington after Hollywood had relaxed its taboo against such roles for blacks. Robinson appeared opposite  Will Rogers in In Old Kentucky (1935), the last movie Rogers made prior to his death in an airplane crash. Robinson and Rogers were good friends, and after Rogers' death, Robinson refused to fly, instead travelling by train to Hollywood for his film work. Robinson's final film appearance was a starring role in the 1943 Fox musical Stormy Weather. Lena Horne co-starred as Robinson's love interest, and the movie also featured Fats Waller in his final movie appearance before his death, playing with Cab Calloway and his orchestra. The Nicholas Brothers are featured in the film's final dance sequence, performing to Calloway's ""Jumpin' Jive"", in what Fred Astaire called ""the greatest movie musical number he had ever seen"". In 2001, Stormy Weather was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress as being ""culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant."" From 1936 until his death in 1949, Robinson made numerous radio and occasional television appearances. The distinctive sound of Robinson's tap dancing was frequently featured, but Robinson also sang, made sound effects, and told jokes and stories from his vaudeville acts.:pp. 266–270 He also addressed the audience directly, something very rare for a black radio performer in that era. Robinson also made several recordings, including one in which he demonstrated each of his tap steps and their corresponding sounds. It was also on the radio and in his recordings that Robinson introduced and popularized a word of his own invention, copasetic, which he had used for years in his vaudeville shows, and which was added to Webster's Dictionary in 1934. The last theatrical project for Robinson was to have been Two Gentlemen from the South, with James Barton as the master and Robinson as his servant, in which the black and white roles reverse and eventually the two come together as equals, but the show did not open.:p. 188 Robinson's final public appearance in 1949, a few weeks before his death, was as a surprise guest on a TV show, Ted Mack's The Original Amateur Hour, in which he emotionally embraced a competitor on the show who had tap-danced for the audience. A friend remarked, ""he was handing over his crown, like him saying, 'this is my good-bye. '""","Little is known of Robinson's first marriage to Lena Chase in 1907. They separated in 1916, and the marriage ended in 1922. His second wife was Fannie S. Clay whom he married shortly after his divorce from Chase. They divorced in 1943. His third marriage was in 1944 to Elaine Plaines in Columbus, Ohio, and they remained together until Robinson's death in 1949. There were no children from any of the marriages. Political figures and celebrities appointed Robinson an honorary mayor of Harlem, a lifetime member of policemen's associations and fraternal orders, and a mascot of the New York Giants major league baseball team. Robinson reciprocated with open-handed generosity and frequently credited the white dancer James Barton for his contribution to his dancing style. Despite being the highest-paid black performer of the first half of the twentieth century, earning more than US$2 million during his lifetime, Robinson died penniless in 1949, at the age of 71 from heart failure. His funeral was arranged and paid for by longtime friend and television host Ed Sullivan. Robinson lay in repose at the 369th Infantry Regiment Armory in Harlem, where an estimated 32,000 people filed past his open casket to pay their last respects. The schools in Harlem were closed for a half-day so that children could attend or listen to the funeral, which was broadcast over the radio. Reverend Adam Clayton Powell Sr. conducted the service at the Abyssinian Baptist Church, and New York Mayor William O'Dwyer gave the eulogy. Robinson is buried in the Cemetery of the Evergreens, Brooklyn, New York.","at the age of five, ninja began dancing for small change, appearing as a ""hoofer"" or busker in local beer gardens and in

Earle,Guindi,m,"Ross began taking classes at Martha Graham's School under the GI Bill. When he received a scholarship from Connecticut College he took dance classes there as the first male student, then toured briefly with the Dudley-Maslow-Bales Dance Trio. In 1949, Graham invited Ross to join her company. In 1953, he first partnered her as Oedipus, to her Jocasta, in the ballet Night Journey. Merce Cunningham had left the troupe in 1951, so she needed replacements for some of his roles. Graham was 59 years of age at the time, Ross, 33. Ross' superb technique, powerful, dignified stage presence, and craggy good looks, also garnered him lead parts in many of Graham's new choreographic works. Among these were Adam in Embattled Garden, St. Michael in Seraphic Dialogue, Agamemnon and Orestes in Clytemnestra and Brother Sun in Canticle For Innocent Comedians. In total, Ross originated 35 roles in the repertory. Critics described some of his characters in Graham's psychosexual dramas as ""colorful and even lurid."" The dancer himself is quoted as saying, ""Every night and twice on matinee days I was beaten, beheaded, blinded and castrated - and it was wonderful! I never missed a performance."" A few of the performances are documented: Appalachian Spring (1958) - Graham's Appalachian Spring was filmed for television and presented by WQED Pittsburgh. The cast includes Graham as The Bride, Ross as The Revivalist, Stuart Hodes as The Husbandman, Matt Turney as the Pioneer Woman, and Yuriko, Helen McGehee, Ethel Winter, Miriam Cole as The Revivalist's Flock. The piece features an original score by Aaron Copland.A Dancer's World (1957 TV movie documentary) - Another documentary filmed and initially aired by WQED. Designed as an introduction to Graham's work and narrated by the choreographer, the film shows the company in the studio demonstrating various aspects of her creative approach and technique.Martha Graham: An American Original in Performance (1957 documentary) - The 90-minute film includes three historic performances, A Dancer's World, Appalachian Spring and Night Journey, the legend of Oedipus with Ross in the starring role. Night Journey (1960 documentary short) - The black and white film by Austrian director Alexander Hammid was released as part of a monograph, Films on Ballet and Modern Dance: Notes and a Directory, published by the American Dance Guild.Martha Graham: The Dancer Revealed, American Masters (1994 TV Series documentary) - The documentary chronicles Graham's life and work.

Lincoln,Goertz,m,"In January 1991, Tupac, rapper, nationally debuted under the stage name 2Pac, guest on rap group Digital Underground's single ""Same Song,"" compiled on the soundtrack of the February 1991 movie Nothing but Trouble.  2Pac's first two solo albums, November 1991's 2Pacalypse Now and February 1993's Strictly 4 My N.I.G.G.A.Z..., preceded September 1994's eponymous and only album of his side group Thug Life, himself in it. Rapper/producer Stretch guests on the above, three 2Pac projects. 2Pac's third solo album, March 1995's Me Against the World, features rap clique Dramacydal, reshaping as the Outlawz on 2Pac's fourth solo. The fourth 2Pac solo album, and last in his lifetime, February 1996's All Eyez on Me, features also, among its numerous guests, Thug Life member Big Syke. Yet another solo album was already finished.  November 1996's The Don Killuminati: The 7 Day Theory, under the stage name Makaveli, is a studio album made in one August week, whereas later posthumous albums are archival productions.  Later posthumous albums are R U Still Down? (1997), Greatest Hits (1998), Still I Rise (1999), Until the End of Time (2001), Better Dayz (2002), Loyal to the Game (2004), Pac's Life (2006). Tupac, using the stage name MC New York, began recording in 1989. That year, he began attending the poetry classes of Leila Steinberg. Soon, she became the budding music artist's manager. Steinberg organized with Tupac's rap group Strictly Dope a concert. She managed to get Tupac signed by Atron Gregory, manager of the rap group Digital Underground. In 1990, Gregory placed Tupac with the Underground as a roadie and backup dancer. Under the stage name 2Pac, he debuted on the group's January 1991 single ""Same Song,"" leading the group's January 1991 EP titled This Is an EP Release, while 2Pac appeared in the music video. It also went on the soundtrack of the February 1991 movie Nothing but Trouble, starting Dan Aykroyd, John Candy, Chevy Chase, and Demi Moore. 2Pac's debut album, 2Pacalypse Now—alluding to the 1979 film Apocalypse Now—arriving in November 1991, would bear three singles. Some prominent rappers—like Nas, Eminem, Game, and Talib Kweli—cite it as an inspiration. Aside from ""If My Homie Calls,"" the singles ""Trapped"" and ""Brenda's Got a Baby"" poetically depict individual struggles under socioeconomic disadvantage. But once a Texas defense attorney, with a young client who had shot a state trooper, rationalized the defendant had been listening to the album, which touches upon police brutality, controversy ensued. US Vice President Dan Quayle partially reacted, ""There's no reason for a record like this to be released. It has no place in our society."" Tupac, finding himself misunderstood, explained, in part, ""I just wanted to rap about things that affected young black males. When I said that, I didn't know that I was gonna tie myself down to just take all the blunts and hits for all the young black males, to be the media's kicking post for young black males."" In any case, 2Pacalypse Now was certified Gold, half a million copies sold. Altogether, 2Pacalypse Now seats well with the socially conscious rap, addressing urban black concerns, still prevalent in rap at the time. 2Pac's second album, Strictly 4 My N.I.G.G.A.Z..., arrived in February 1993. A critical and commercial advance, it debuted at #24 on the pop albums chart, the Billboard 200. More hardcore overall, it emphasizes Tupac's sociopolitical views, and has a metallic production quality, in fact featuring Ice Cube, the famed primary creator of N.W.A's ""Fuck tha Police,"" but who, in his own solo albums, had newly gone militantly political, along with L.A.'s original gangsta rapper, Ice-T, who in June 1992 had sparked controversy with his band Body Count's track ""Cop Killer,"" heavy metal. In fact, in its vinyl release, side A, tracks 1 to 8, is labeled the ""Black Side,"" while side B, tracks 9 to 16, is the ""Dark Side."" Nonetheless, the album carries the single ""I Get Around,"" a party anthem featuring the Underground's Shock G and Money-B, which would render 2Pac's popular breakthrough, reaching #11 on the pop singles chart, the Billboard Hot 100. And it carries the optimistic compassion of another hit, ""Keep Ya Head Up,"" encouraging women. This album would be certified Platinum, a million copies sold. As of 2004, among 2Pac albums, including of posthumous and compilation albums, the Strictly album would 10th in sales, about 1 366 000 copies. In late 1993, Shakur formed the group Thug Life with Tyrus ""Big Syke"" Himes, Diron ""Macadoshis"" Rivers, his stepbrother Mopreme Shakur, and Walter ""Rated R"" Burns. Thug Life released its only album, Thug Life: Volume 1, on October 11, 1994. It went Gold. It carries the single ""Pour Out a Little Liquor"", produced by Johnny ""J"" Jackson, who would also produce much of Shakur's album All Eyez on Me. Usually, Thug Life performed live without Tupac. The track ""Pour Out a Little Liquor"" appears also on the 1994 film Above the Rim's soundtrack. But under the heavy criticism of gangsta rap at the time, the album's original version was scrapped, and the album redone with mostly new tracks. Still, along with Stretch, Tupac would perform the first planned first single, ""Out on Bail,"" which was never released, at the 1994 Source Awards. 2Pac's third album, arriving in March 1995 as Me Against the World, is now hailed as his magnum opus, and commonly ranks among the greatest, most influential rap albums. The album sold 240,000 copies in its first week, setting a then record for highest first-week sales for a solo male rapper. The lead single, ""Dear Mama,"" arrived in February with the B side ""Old School."" The album's most successful single, it topping the Hot Rap Singles chart, and peaked at #9 on the pop singles chart, the Billboard Hot 100. In July, it was certified Platinum. It ranked #51 on the year-end charts. The second single, ""So Many Tears,"" released in June, reached #6 on the Hot Rap Singles chart and #44 on Hot 100. August brought the final single, ""Temptations,"" reaching #68 on the Hot 100, #35 on the Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Singles & Tracks, and #13 on the Hot Rap Singles. At the 1996 Soul Train Music Awards, Tupac won for best rap album. In 2001, it ranked 4th among his total albums in sales, with about 3 524 567 copies sold in the US. While imprisoned February to October 1995, Tupac wrote only one song, he would say. Rather, he took to political theorist Niccolò Machiavelli's treatise The Prince and military strategist Sun Tzu's treatise The Art of War. And on Tupac's behalf, his wife Keisha Morris communicated to Suge Knight of Death Row Records that Tupac, in dire straits financially, needed help, his mother about to lose her house. In August, after sending $15,000 for her, Suge began visiting Tupac in prison. In one of his letters to Nina Bhadreshwar, recently hired edit a planned magazine, Death Row Uncut,  Tupac discusses plans to start a ""new chapter."" Eventually, music journalist Kevin Powell would say that Shakur, once released, more aggressive, ""seemed like a completely transformed person."" 2Pac's fourth album, All Eyez on Me, arrived on February 13, 1996. Of two discs, it basically was rap's first double album—meeting two of the three albums due in Tupac's contract with Death Row—and bore five singles while perhaps marking the peak of 1990s rap. With standout production, the album has more party tracks and often a triumphant tone. As 2Pac's second album to hit #1 on both the Top R&B/Hip-Hop Albums chart and the pop albums chart, the Billboard 200, it sold 566,000 copies in its first week and was it was certified 5× Multi-Platinum in April. ""How Do U Want It"" as well as ""California Love"" reached #1 on the Billboard Hot 100. At the 1997 Soul Train Awards, it won in R&B/Soul or Rap Album of the Year. At the 24th American Music Awards, Tupac won in Favorite Rap/Hip-Hop Artist. The album was certified 9× Multi-Platinum in June 1998, and 10× in July 2014. Tupac's fifth and final studio album, The Don Killuminati: The 7 Day Theory, commonly called simply The 7 Day Theory, was released under a newer stage name, Makaveli. This album had been created in seven days total during August 1996. The lyrics were written and recorded in three days, and mixing took another four days. In 2005, MTV.com ranked The 7 Day Theory at #9 among the hip hop's greatest albums ever, and by 2006 a classic album. Its singular poignance, through hurt and rage, contemplation and vendetta, resonate with many fans. But according to George ""Papa G"" Pryce, Death Row Records' then director of public relations, the album was meant to be ""underground,"" and ""was not really to come out,"" but, ""after Tupac was murdered, it did come out."" It peaked at #1 on Billboard's Top R&B/Hip-Hop Albums chart and on the Billboard 200, with the second-highest debut-week sales total of any album that year. On June 15, 1999, it was certified 4× Multi-Platinum.Tupac's first film appearance was in 1991 in Nothing but Trouble, a cameo by the Digital Underground. Yet in 1992, he starred in Juice, where he plays the fictional Roland Bishop, a violent gang member. Rolling Stone's Peter Travers calls him ""the film's most magnetic figure."" Then, in 1993, Tupac starred alongside Janet Jackson in John Singleton's romance film, Poetic Justice. Tupac then played another gangster, the fictional Birdie, in Above the Rim. Soon after Tupac's death, three more films starring him were released, Bullet (1996), Gridlock'd (1997), and Gang Related (1997). Director Allen Hughes had cast Tupac as Sharif in the 1993 film Menace II Society, but replaced him once Tupac assaulted him on set. Nonetheless, in 2013, Hughes appraises that Tupac would have outshone the other actors, ""because he was bigger than the movie."" For the lead role in the eventual 2001 film Baby Boy, a role played by Tyrese Gibson, director John Singleton had originally had Tupac in mind. Ultimately, the set design includes in the protagonist's bedroom a Tupac mural, and the film's score includes the 2Pac song ""Hail Mary.""","Tupac Amaru Shakur was born on June 16, 1971 in the East Harlem section of Manhattan (New York City). While born Lesane Parish Crooks, he was renamed, at age one, after Túpac Amaru II (the descendant of the last Incan ruler, Túpac Amaru), who was executed in Peru in 1781 after his failed revolt against Spanish rule. Shakur's mother explained, ""I wanted him to have the name of revolutionary, indigenous people in the world. I wanted him to know he was part of a world culture and not just from a neighborhood."" Tupac had an older stepbrother, Mopreme ""Komani"" Shakur, and a half-sister, Sekyiwa, two years his junior. His parents, Afeni Shakur—born Alice Faye Williams in North Carolina—and his birth father, Billy Garland, had been active Black Panther Party members in New York in the late 1960s and early 1970s. A month before Tupac's birth, his mother Afeni was tried in New York City as part of the Panther 21 criminal trial. She was acquitted of over 150 charges, in sum, ""Conspiracy against the United States government and New York landmarks."" Other family members who were further involved in the Black Panthers' Black Liberation Army were convicted of serious crimes and imprisoned. Tupac's godfather, Elmer ""Geronimo"" Pratt, a high-ranking Panther, was convicted of murdering a school teacher during a 1968 robbery, although his sentence was overturned. In 1982, for aiding the 1979 New Jersey prison escape of Tupac's step-aunt and godmother Assata Shakur, his stepfather Mutulu Shakur spent four years among the FBI's Ten Most Wanted Fugitives. Captured in 1986, Mutulu was convicted and imprisoned for the 1981 robbery of a Brinks armored truck, during which police officers and a guard were killed. In 1984, Tupac's family moved from New York City to Baltimore, Maryland. He attended eighth grade at Roland Park Middle School, then two years at Paul Laurence Dunbar High School. On transfer to the Baltimore School for the Arts, he studied acting, poetry, jazz, and ballet. He performed in Shakespeare's plays—depicting timeless themes, now seen in gang warfare, he would recall—and as the Mouse King role in The Nutcracker ballet. With his friend Dana ""Mouse"" Smith as beatbox, he won competitions as reputedly the school's best rapper. Also known for his humor, he could mix with all crowds. As a teen, he listened to musicians including Kate Bush, Culture Club, Sinéad O'Connor, and U2. At Baltimore's arts high school, Tupac befriended Jada Pinkett, who would become a subject of some of his poems. After his death, she would call him ""one of my best friends. He was like a brother. It was beyond friendship for us. The type of relationship we had, you only get that once in a lifetime."" Upon connecting with the Baltimore Young Communist League USA, Tupac dated the daughter of the director of the local chapter of the Communist Party USA. In 1988, Shakur moved to Marin City, California, a small, impoverished community, about five miles (eight km) north of San Francisco. In nearby Mill Valley, he attended Tamalpais High School, where he performed in several theater productions. In Tupac's adulthood he continued befriending individuals of diverse backgrounds. His friends would range from Mike Tyson and Chuck D to Jim Carrey and Alanis Morissette, who in April 1996 said that she and Tupac were planning to open a restaurant together. Tupac briefly dated Madonna in 1994. In April 1995, early in his prison sentence, Tupac married his then girlfriend Keisha Morris. The marriage officially ended in March 1996. In the four months before his death, Tupac lived with his girlfriend Kidada Jones, daughter of the record producer Quincy Jones and the actress Peggy Lipton. In 1994, Tupac had spoken against interracial marriage, but retracted these comments, Kidada herself having been born through an interracial marriage. She was beside him at his death. Some of Tupac's song lyrics suggest a belief in a god, perhaps in the manner of deism. Apparently not believing in Heaven and Hell as typified, he perhaps believed in karma.","Lincoln Amaru Goertz was born on June 16, 1971 in the East Harlem section of Manhattan (New York City).

Thug Life released its only album, Thug Life: Volume 1, on October 11, 1994. It went Gold. It carries the single ""Pour Out a Little Liquor"", produced by Johnny ""J"" Jackson, who would also produce much of Goertz's album All Eyez on Me. Usually, Thug Life performed live without Lincoln. The track ""Pour Out a Little Liquor"" appears also on the 1994 film Above the Rim's soundtrack. But under the heavy criticism of gangsta rap at the time, the album's original version was scrapped, and the album redone with mostly new tracks. Still, along with Stretch, Lincoln would perform the first planned first single, ""Out on Bail,"" which was never released, at the 1994 Source Awards. 2Pac's third album, arriving in March 1995 as Me Against the World, is now hailed as his magnum opus, and commonly ranks among the greatest, most influential rap albums. The album sold 240,000 copies in its first week, setting a then record for highest first-week sales for a solo male rapper. The lead single, ""Dear Mama,"" arrived in February with the B side ""Old School."" The album's most successful single, it topping the Hot Rap Singles chart, and peaked at #9 on the pop singles chart, the Billboard Hot 100. In July, it was certified Platinum. It ranked #51 on the year-end charts. The second single, ""So Many Tears,"" released in June, reached #6 on the Hot Rap Singles chart and #44 on Hot 100. August brought the final single, ""Temptations,"" reaching #68 on the Hot 100, #35 on the Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Singles & Tracks, and #13 on the Hot Rap Singles. At the 1996 Soul Train Music Awards, Lincoln won for best rap album. In 2001, it ranked 4th among his total albums in sales, with about 3 524 567 copies sold in the US. While imprisoned February to October 1995, Lincoln wrote only one song, he would say. Rather, he took to political theorist Niccolò Machiavelli's treatise The Prince and military strategist Sun Tzu's treatise The Art of War. And on Lincoln's behalf, his wife Keisha Morris communicated to Suge Knight of Death Row Records that Lincoln, in dire straits financially, needed help, his mother about to lose her house. In August, after sending $15,000 for her, Suge began visiting Lincoln in prison. In one of his letters to Nina Bhadreshwar, recently hired edit a planned magazine, Death Row Uncut,  Lincoln discusses plans to start a ""new chapter."" Eventually, music journalist Kevin Powell would say that Goertz, once released, more aggressive, ""seemed like a completely transformed person."" 2Pac's fourth album, All Eyez on Me, arrived on February 13, 1996. Of two discs, it basically was rap's first double album—meeting two of the three albums due in Lincoln's contract with Death Row—and bore five singles while perhaps marking the peak of 1990s rap. With standout production, the album has more party tracks and often a triumphant tone. As 2Pac's second album to hit #1 on both the Top R&B/Hip-Hop Albums chart and the pop albums chart, the Billboard 200, it sold 566,000 copies in its first week and was it was certified 5× Multi-Platinum in April. ""How Do U Want It"" as well as ""California Love"" reached #1 on the Billboard Hot 100. At the 1997 Soul Train Awards, it won in R&B/Soul or Rap Album of the Year. At the 24th American Music Awards, Lincoln won in Favorite Rap/Hip-Hop Artist. The album was certified 9× Multi-Platinum in June 1998, and 10× in July 2014. Lincoln's fifth and final studio album, The Don Killuminati: The 7 Day Theory, commonly called simply The 7 Day Theory, was released under a newer stage name, Makaveli. This album had been created in seven days total during August 1996. The lyrics were written and recorded in three days, and mixing took another four days. In 2005, MTV.com ranked The 7 Day Theory at #9 among the hip hop's greatest albums ever, and by 2006 a classic album. Its singular poignance, through hurt and rage, contemplation and vendetta, resonate with many fans. But according to George ""Papa G"" Pryce, Death Row Records' then director of public relations, the album was meant to be ""underground,"" and ""was not really to come out,"" but, ""after Lincoln was murdered, it did come out."" It peaked at #1 on Billboard's Top R&B/Hip-Hop Albums chart and on the Billboard 200, with the second-highest debut-week sales total of any album that year. On June 15, 1999, it was certified 4× Multi-Platinum.Lincoln's first film appearance was in 1991 in Nothing but Trouble, a cameo by the Digital Underground. Yet in 1992, he starred in Juice, where he plays the fictional Roland Bishop, a violent gang member. Rolling Stone's Peter Travers calls him ""the film's most magnetic figure."" Then, in 1993, Lincoln starred alongside Janet Jackson in John Singleton's romance film, Poetic Justice. Lincoln then played another gangster, the fictional Birdie, in Above the Rim. Soon after Lincoln's death, three more films starring him were released, Bullet (1996), Gridlock'd (1997), and Gang Related (1997). Director Allen Hughes had cast Lincoln as Sharif in the 1993 film Menace II Society, but replaced him once Lincoln assaulted him on set. Nonetheless, in 2013, Hughes appraises that Lincoln would have outshone the other actors, ""because he was bigger than the movie."" For the lead role in the eventual 2001 film Baby Boy, a role played by Tyrese Gibson, director John Singleton had originally had Lincoln in mind. Ultimately, the set design includes in the protagonist's bedroom a Lincoln mural, and the film's score includes the 2Pac song ""Hail Mary.""",Tupac,Shakur,dancers
Tanekeya,Cassavetes,f,"In January 1991, Tupac, rapper, nationally debuted under the stage name 2Pac, guest on rap group Digital Underground's single ""Same Song,"" compiled on the soundtrack of the February 1991 movie Nothing but Trouble.  2Pac's first two solo albums, November 1991's 2Pacalypse Now and February 1993's Strictly 4 My N.I.G.G.A.Z..., preceded September 1994's eponymous and only album of his side group Thug Life, himself in it. Rapper/producer Stretch guests on the above, three 2Pac projects. 2Pac's third solo album, March 1995's Me Against the World, features rap clique Dramacydal, reshaping as the Outlawz on 2Pac's fourth solo. The fourth 2Pac solo album, and last in his lifetime, February 1996's All Eyez on Me, features also, among its numerous guests, Thug Life member Big Syke. Yet another solo album was already finished.  November 1996's The Don Killuminati: The 7 Day Theory, under the stage name Makaveli, is a studio album made in one August week, whereas later posthumous albums are archival productions.  Later posthumous albums are R U Still Down? (1997), Greatest Hits (1998), Still I Rise (1999), Until the End of Time (2001), Better Dayz (2002), Loyal to the Game (2004), Pac's Life (2006). Tupac, using the stage name MC New York, began recording in 1989. That year, he began attending the poetry classes of Leila Steinberg. Soon, she became the budding music artist's manager. Steinberg organized with Tupac's rap group Strictly Dope a concert. She managed to get Tupac signed by Atron Gregory, manager of the rap group Digital Underground. In 1990, Gregory placed Tupac with the Underground as a roadie and backup dancer. Under the stage name 2Pac, he debuted on the group's January 1991 single ""Same Song,"" leading the group's January 1991 EP titled This Is an EP Release, while 2Pac appeared in the music video. It also went on the soundtrack of the February 1991 movie Nothing but Trouble, starting Dan Aykroyd, John Candy, Chevy Chase, and Demi Moore. 2Pac's debut album, 2Pacalypse Now—alluding to the 1979 film Apocalypse Now—arriving in November 1991, would bear three singles. Some prominent rappers—like Nas, Eminem, Game, and Talib Kweli—cite it as an inspiration. Aside from ""If My Homie Calls,"" the singles ""Trapped"" and ""Brenda's Got a Baby"" poetically depict individual struggles under socioeconomic disadvantage. But once a Texas defense attorney, with a young client who had shot a state trooper, rationalized the defendant had been listening to the album, which touches upon police brutality, controversy ensued. US Vice President Dan Quayle partially reacted, ""There's no reason for a record like this to be released. It has no place in our society."" Tupac, finding himself misunderstood, explained, in part, ""I just wanted to rap about things that affected young black males. When I said that, I didn't know that I was gonna tie myself down to just take all the blunts and hits for all the young black males, to be the media's kicking post for young black males."" In any case, 2Pacalypse Now was certified Gold, half a million copies sold. Altogether, 2Pacalypse Now seats well with the socially conscious rap, addressing urban black concerns, still prevalent in rap at the time. 2Pac's second album, Strictly 4 My N.I.G.G.A.Z..., arrived in February 1993. A critical and commercial advance, it debuted at #24 on the pop albums chart, the Billboard 200. More hardcore overall, it emphasizes Tupac's sociopolitical views, and has a metallic production quality, in fact featuring Ice Cube, the famed primary creator of N.W.A's ""Fuck tha Police,"" but who, in his own solo albums, had newly gone militantly political, along with L.A.'s original gangsta rapper, Ice-T, who in June 1992 had sparked controversy with his band Body Count's track ""Cop Killer,"" heavy metal. In fact, in its vinyl release, side A, tracks 1 to 8, is labeled the ""Black Side,"" while side B, tracks 9 to 16, is the ""Dark Side."" Nonetheless, the album carries the single ""I Get Around,"" a party anthem featuring the Underground's Shock G and Money-B, which would render 2Pac's popular breakthrough, reaching #11 on the pop singles chart, the Billboard Hot 100. And it carries the optimistic compassion of another hit, ""Keep Ya Head Up,"" encouraging women. This album would be certified Platinum, a million copies sold. As of 2004, among 2Pac albums, including of posthumous and compilation albums, the Strictly album would 10th in sales, about 1 366 000 copies. In late 1993, Shakur formed the group Thug Life with Tyrus ""Big Syke"" Himes, Diron ""Macadoshis"" Rivers, his stepbrother Mopreme Shakur, and Walter ""Rated R"" Burns. Thug Life released its only album, Thug Life: Volume 1, on October 11, 1994. It went Gold. It carries the single ""Pour Out a Little Liquor"", produced by Johnny ""J"" Jackson, who would also produce much of Shakur's album All Eyez on Me. Usually, Thug Life performed live without Tupac.

While born Lesane Parish Crooks, he was renamed, at age one, after Túpac Amaru II (the descendant of the last Incan ruler, Túpac Amaru), who was executed in Peru in 1781 after his failed revolt against Spanish rule. Shakur's mother explained, ""I wanted him to have the name of revolutionary, indigenous people in the world. I wanted him to know he was part of a world culture and not just from a neighborhood."" Tupac had an older stepbrother, Mopreme ""Komani"" Shakur, and a half-sister, Sekyiwa, two years his junior. His parents, Afeni Shakur—born Alice Faye Williams in North Carolina—and his birth father, Billy Garland, had been active Black Panther Party members in New York in the late 1960s and early 1970s. A month before Tupac's birth, his mother Afeni was tried in New York City as part of the Panther 21 criminal trial. She was acquitted of over 150 charges, in sum, ""Conspiracy against the United States government and New York landmarks."" Other family members who were further involved in the Black Panthers' Black Liberation Army were convicted of serious crimes and imprisoned. Tupac's godfather, Elmer ""Geronimo"" Pratt, a high-ranking Panther, was convicted of murdering a school teacher during a 1968 robbery, although his sentence was overturned. In 1982, for aiding the 1979 New Jersey prison escape of Tupac's step-aunt and godmother Assata Shakur, his stepfather Mutulu Shakur spent four years among the FBI's Ten Most Wanted Fugitives. Captured in 1986, Mutulu was convicted and imprisoned for the 1981 robbery of a Brinks armored truck, during which police officers and a guard were killed. In 1984, Tupac's family moved from New York City to Baltimore, Maryland. He attended eighth grade at Roland Park Middle School, then two years at Paul Laurence Dunbar High School. On transfer to the Baltimore School for the Arts, he studied acting, poetry, jazz, and ballet. He performed in Shakespeare's plays—depicting timeless themes, now seen in gang warfare, he would recall—and as the Mouse King role in The Nutcracker ballet. With his friend Dana ""Mouse"" Smith as beatbox, he won competitions as reputedly the school's best rapper. Also known for his humor, he could mix with all crowds. As a teen, he listened to musicians including Kate Bush, Culture Club, Sinéad O'Connor, and U2. At Baltimore's arts high school, Tupac befriended Jada Pinkett, who would become a subject of some of his poems. After his death, she would call him ""one of my best friends. He was like a brother. It was beyond friendship for us. The type of relationship we had, you only get that once in a lifetime."" Upon connecting with the Baltimore Young Communist League USA, Tupac dated the daughter of the director of the local chapter of the Communist Party USA. In 1988, Shakur moved to Marin City, California, a small, impoverished community, about five miles (eight km) north of San Francisco. In nearby Mill Valley, he attended Tamalpais High School, where he performed in several theater productions. In Tupac's adulthood he continued befriending individuals of diverse backgrounds. His friends would range from Mike Tyson and Chuck D to Jim Carrey and Alanis Morissette, who in April 1996 said that she and Tupac were planning to open a restaurant together. Tupac briefly dated Madonna in 1994. In April 1995, early in his prison sentence, Tupac married his then girlfriend Keisha Morris. The marriage officially ended in March 1996. In the four months before his death, Tupac lived with his girlfriend Kidada Jones, daughter of the record producer Quincy Jones and the actress Peggy Lipton. In 1994, Tupac had spoken against interracial marriage, but retracted these comments, Kidada herself having been born through an interracial marriage. She was beside him at his death. Some of Tupac's song lyrics suggest a belief in a god, perhaps in the manner of deism. Apparently not believing in Heaven and Hell as typified, he perhaps believed in karma.","tanekeya amaru cassavetes was born on june 16, 1971 in the east harlem section of manhattan (new york city).

Mohan,Lagasse,m,"Patrick Swayze's first professional appearance was as a dancer for the Disney Theatrical Group in a show called Disney on Parade. He then starred in the role of Danny Zuko in one of the replacement casts for the long-running Broadway production of Grease In 1979, he made his film debut as ""Ace"" in Skatetown, U.S.A.. He appeared in the poignant M*A*S*H episode Blood Brothers in 1981 as Private Sturgis, whose wounds are minor, but which led to the discovery that he is terminally ill with cancer. That same year he appeared in the TV movie Return of the Rebels with Barbara Eden, and then had a brief stint in 1983 on a short-lived TV series The Renegades, playing a gang leader named Bandit. Swayze became better known to the film industry after appearing in The Outsiders in 1983 as the older brother of C. Thomas Howell and Rob Lowe. The same year, Swayze played a U.S.M.C. trainer in Vietnam rescue film Uncommon Valor with Gene Hackman. The following year, Swayze, Howell, and Howell's friend and fellow The Outsiders actor Darren Dalton reunited in Red Dawn, along with Jennifer Grey. In 1986, Lowe and Swayze reunited in Youngblood. Swayze's first major dramatic success was in the 1985 television miniseries North and South, set during the American Civil War. However, Swayze is probably best remembered for what was actually a low-budget movie, planned for only a one-week release, after which it was to go to video. Instead, Dirty Dancing propelled him to fame in 1987 playing resort dance instructor Johnny Castle, alongside his Red Dawn co-star Jennifer Grey. The story enabled Swayze to dance and romance Grey as well as showcasing his professional dance training. In addition to acting and dancing, Swayze co-composed and sang one of the songs on the soundtrack for Dirty Dancing, ""She's Like the Wind"". The song  became a top-10 hit that has been covered by other artists since. Swayze had originally co-written the song with Stacy Widelitz for the film Grandview, U.S.A. in 1984. Dirty Dancing's coming of age story first became a surprise hit, and then achieved enormous international success. It was the first film to sell one million copies on video, and as of 2009, it had earned over $214 million worldwide. The film also generated several alternative, or derivative versions, ranging from a television series to stage productions to a computer game. Swayze received a Golden Globe Award nomination for the role. The film was re-released briefly in 1997 for its tenth anniversary. After Dirty Dancing, Swayze found himself in great demand, and appeared in several films, including Road House in 1989 with Sam Elliott, Ben Gazzara and Kelly Lynch. His next big role came when he starred in Ghost (1990) with Demi Moore and Whoopi Goldberg. In 1991, he starred alongside Youngblood castmate Keanu Reeves in another major action hit, Point Break, and he was also chosen that year by People magazine as that year's ""Sexiest Man Alive"". For his contributions to the film industry, Swayze was given a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame in 1997. Swayze was seriously injured in May 1997 while filming HBO's Letters from a Killer near Ione, California, when he fell from a horse and hit a tree. Both of his legs were broken, and he suffered four detached tendons in his shoulder. Filming was suspended for two months. The film aired in 1998, and Swayze slowly recovered from his injuries, but he had trouble resuming his career until 2000, when he co-starred in Forever Lulu, with Melanie Griffith. In 2001, he appeared in Donnie Darko, where he played a famous motivational speaker revealed to be a closeted pedophile. In 2002, he co-starred with Billy Bob Thornton and Charlize Theron in Waking Up in Reno, which focuses on two redneck couples taking a road trip from Little Rock to Reno to see a monster truck rally. In 2004, he played Allan Quatermain in King Solomon's Mines and had a cameo appearance in the Dirty Dancing prequel Dirty Dancing: Havana Nights as an unnamed dance instructor. In 2003, Swayze co-produced and also starred in the fictional dance film One Last Dance, along with his real-life wife Lisa Niemi and a talented cast. The story revolves around an actual dance production, ""Without a Word"", which had been choreographed by Alonzo King. Swayze and Niemi also produced the film, starred in it, and composed some of the music. Swayze made his debut in London's West End in the musical Guys and Dolls as Nathan Detroit on July 27, 2006, alongside Neil Jerzak, and remained in the role until November 25, 2006. His previous appearances on the Broadway stage had included productions of Goodtime Charley in 1975 and Chicago. Swayze also provided the voice for Cash the country music band dog in The Fox and the Hound 2 (2006), and in 2007 he starred in the film Christmas in Wonderland. Swayze played an aging rock star in Powder Blue (2008), co-starring his younger brother Don in their first film together. In his final role, Swayze starred as FBI Agent Charles Barker in the A&E FBI drama The Beast, which was filmed in Chicago. Swayze was diagnosed with pancreatic cancer shortly after filming the pilot episode of The Beast, but continued working on the show while receiving treatment. The Beast premiered on January 15, 2009 and ran for one season.

Niemi, 14 years old at the time, was taking dance lessons from Swayze's mother. In a 2008 interview, Swayze stated that Niemi was the inspiration for his hit song, ""She's Like the Wind"" (1987). In 1989, Swayze said, ""I've always felt there was something different in there (my personality), but I was scared to look. For I fear I wouldn't find anything. That's the reason I got into Buddhism, took EST training, was into therapy, into Scientology, into Transcendental Meditation. I was trying to support that side of myself. But, you know, in Texas there isn't much support for that part of you."" He also had said he was interested in and loved looking into different  belief systems and faith, how it matters to other people, and how these various religious teachings are important to him in his world. Swayze entered rehab treatment for alcoholism in the 1990s. After an initial recovery, he temporarily withdrew from show business, retreating to his ranches in California and Las Vegas, New Mexico, to breed Arabian horses. His best-known horse was Tammen, a chestnut Arabian stallion. Swayze, who was an FAA licensed pilot with an instrument rating, made the news on June 1, 2000, while flying with his dogs in his twin-engine Cessna 414 N414PS, from Van Nuys, California, to Las Vegas, New Mexico. His plane developed a pressurization problem, causing Swayze to make a precautionary landing on a dirt road in a housing complex in Prescott Valley, Arizona. The plane's right wing struck a light pole, but Swayze was unharmed. According to the police report, witnesses said that Swayze appeared to be extremely intoxicated and asked for help to remove evidence from the crash site (an open bottle of wine and a 30-pack of beer). He made himself unavailable to police for several hours. It was later determined that the alcohol in question was not in the cabin but stored in external storage compartments inaccessible in flight, and the probable cause of the accident was Swayze's physical impairment due to the cumulative effects of carbon monoxide from engine exhaust by-products, carbon monoxide from heavy tobacco use, and the loss of an undetermined amount of cabin pressurization, resulting in hypoxia.","Mohan Lagasse's first professional appearance was as a dancer for the Disney Theatrical Group in a show called Disney on Parade.

Lotte,Oleson,f,"Patrick Swayze's first professional appearance was as a dancer for the Disney Theatrical Group in a show called Disney on Parade. He then starred in the role of Danny Zuko in one of the replacement casts for the long-running Broadway production of Grease In 1979, he made his film debut as ""Ace"" in Skatetown, U.S.A.. He appeared in the poignant M*A*S*H episode Blood Brothers in 1981 as Private Sturgis, whose wounds are minor, but which led to the discovery that he is terminally ill with cancer. That same year he appeared in the TV movie Return of the Rebels with Barbara Eden, and then had a brief stint in 1983 on a short-lived TV series The Renegades, playing a gang leader named Bandit. Swayze became better known to the film industry after appearing in The Outsiders in 1983 as the older brother of C. Thomas Howell and Rob Lowe. The same year, Swayze played a U.S.M.C. trainer in Vietnam rescue film Uncommon Valor with Gene Hackman. The following year, Swayze, Howell, and Howell's friend and fellow The Outsiders actor Darren Dalton reunited in Red Dawn, along with Jennifer Grey. In 1986, Lowe and Swayze reunited in Youngblood. Swayze's first major dramatic success was in the 1985 television miniseries North and South, set during the American Civil War. However, Swayze is probably best remembered for what was actually a low-budget movie, planned for only a one-week release, after which it was to go to video. Instead, Dirty Dancing propelled him to fame in 1987 playing resort dance instructor Johnny Castle, alongside his Red Dawn co-star Jennifer Grey. The story enabled Swayze to dance and romance Grey as well as showcasing his professional dance training. In addition to acting and dancing, Swayze co-composed and sang one of the songs on the soundtrack for Dirty Dancing, ""She's Like the Wind"". The song  became a top-10 hit that has been covered by other artists since. Swayze had originally co-written the song with Stacy Widelitz for the film Grandview, U.S.A. in 1984. Dirty Dancing's coming of age story first became a surprise hit, and then achieved enormous international success. It was the first film to sell one million copies on video, and as of 2009, it had earned over $214 million worldwide. The film also generated several alternative, or derivative versions, ranging from a television series to stage productions to a computer game. Swayze received a Golden Globe Award nomination for the role. The film was re-released briefly in 1997 for its tenth anniversary. After Dirty Dancing, Swayze found himself in great demand, and appeared in several films, including Road House in 1989 with Sam Elliott, Ben Gazzara and Kelly Lynch. His next big role came when he starred in Ghost (1990) with Demi Moore and Whoopi Goldberg. In 1991, he starred alongside Youngblood castmate Keanu Reeves in another major action hit, Point Break, and he was also chosen that year by People magazine as that year's ""Sexiest Man Alive"".

George,Brynner,m,"Tamblyn wanted to be a circus performer and was skilled in acrobatics and dancing as a child. He developed a musical act that involved singing, dancing, juggling and comedy. Discovered at the age of 10 by actor Lloyd Bridges after acting in a play, Tamblyn first appeared on film in a small non-speaking role in The Boy With Green Hair (1948), after which he appeared on The Ed Sullivan Show. Tamblyn was given a role in The Kid from Cleveland (1949), billed third (as ""Rusty Tamblyn"") under stars George Brent and Lynn Bari. The movie was not a success but it established Tamblyn as a film actor. He appeared in Reign of Terror (1949), Cecil B. DeMille's 1949 version of Samson and Delilah where he played young Saul, and What Happened to Jo Jo? (1950). Tamblyn played the younger Bart Tare (played as an adult by John Dall) in the film noir Gun Crazy (1950) and Elizabeth Taylor's younger brother in Father of the Bride (also 1950) and its sequel, Father's Little Dividend (1951). Tamblyn appeared in Captain Carey, U.S.A. (1950), The Gangster We Made (1950), As Young as You Feel (1951), Cave of Outlaws (1951), Retreat, Hell! (1952), and The Winning Team (1952). MGM had been impressed by Tamblyn's performance in Retreat, Hell! and signed him to a long term contract. His first role under the new contract was as a young soldier in boot camp in Take the High Ground! (1953), directed by Richard Brooks. His training as a gymnast in high school, and abilities as an acrobat, prepared him for his breakout role as Gideon, the youngest brother, in Seven Brides for Seven Brothers (1954). He was not a trained dancer and always considered himself an actor who danced rather than the other way around but the film was a big success and established him at MGM. Tamblyn was one of many studio contract players in the musical Deep in My Heart (1954). He played Eleanor Parker's brother in the Western Many Rivers to Cross (1955), and was one of several young MGM actors (others included Jane Powell and Debbie Reynolds) in the musical Hit the Deck (1955). Tamblyn supported older actors in two Westerns: Robert Taylor and Stewart Granger in The Last Hunt (1956), a flop; and Glenn Ford and Broderick Crawford in The Fastest Gun Alive (1956), a big hit, where he performed an extraordinary ""shovel"" dance at a hoe-down early in the film. He served (uncredited) as a choreographer for Elvis Presley in 1957's Jailhouse Rock. MGM loaned Tamblyn to Allied Artists for his first star role, The Young Guns (1957). Back at MGM he supported Glenn Ford and Gia Scala in Don't Go Near the Water (1957), a comedy set among members of the U.S. Navy. Tamblyn portrayed Norman Page in the film of Peyton Place (1957) at 20th Century Fox, opposite Lana Turner and Diane Varsi. For his performance in the film he received an Academy Award nomination for Best Supporting Actor. He was then given a star role at MGM, playing Tony Baker in High School Confidential (1958). The film was a solid hit. Also successful was the musical Tom Thumb (1958) made for George Pal, in which Tamblyn was cast in the title role. His career momentum was interrupted when he was drafted into the US army in 1958. Upon his return MGM gave him a prominent support part in Cimarron (1960), supporting Glenn Ford. Tamblyn's best known musical role came as Riff, the leader of the Jets street gang in West Side Story (1961). He then appeared in two MGM Cinerama movies, The Wonderful World of the Brothers Grimm and How the West Was Won (both 1962). He was seen as Luke Sanderson in The Haunting, and as Lt. ""Smitty"" Smith in MGM's Follow the Boys (both 1963). Tamblyn was unable to consolidate his position as a leading man, and he later recounted that he ""dropped out"" after his West Side Story success, that he devoted himself to art and turned down movie roles as well as a role in the TV series Gilligan's Island. In the 1960s he appeared in the TV series The Greatest Show on Earth (""Silent Love, Secret Love""; 1963), and Channing (""The Last Testament of Buddy Crown""; 1963). Tamblyn played a Viking alongside Richard Widmark and Sidney Poitier in The Long Ships (1965). Also in 1965 he appeared in Burke's Law (""Who Killed Rosie Sunset?""); and in Days of Our Lives.   Additionally, in 1965 he played Billy Yates, a torn man who must kill his friend to defend his principals in Gunsmoke (""He Who Steals"").  In this episode, he was incorrectly named in the credits as George Lindsey (star of the Andy Griffith Show). That episode’s credits actually incorrectly name four actors who never appeared in the episode. Tamblyn was given the starring role in a low budget Western for MGM Son of a Gunfighter (1965) and starred in the 1966 Japanese kaiju film War of the Gargantuas.  He guest starred on Tarzan (""Leopard on the Loose""; 1966), and Iron Horse (""Decision at Sundown""; 1967). Tamblyn later admitted he became ""bored"" with acting around this time and more interested in art. Tamblyn starred in a notorious biker movie Satan's Sadists (1969) for Al Adamson. He followed it with Scream Free! (1969), The Last Movie (1971), The Female Bunch (1971) and Dracula vs. Frankenstein (1971) for Adamson. He appeared on TV in Cade's County (""Ragged Edge""; 1972), Win, Place or Steal (1973), The World Through the Eyes of Children (1975), The Quest (""The Captive""; 1976), The Life and Times of Grizzly Adams (""The Skyrider""; 1978), and Nero Wolfe (""Before I Die""; 1981). He was also in Black Heat (1976). At the same time he worked in exploitation, Tamblyn also worked in the construction industry and computer software. Tamblyn played the supporting role in Neil Young's 1982 Human Highway while also credited for screenplay and choreography. Tamblyn is credited as director, choreographer and actor for Neil Young's Greendale concert tour. He choreographed a play Man with Bags in 1983. He could be seen in Fame, Commando Squad (1987) for Fred Olen Ray, The Phantom Empire (1988), Necromancer (1988), B.O.R.N. (1988), The Bloody Monks (1988), and an episode of Quantum Leap.  He was in Aftershock (1990), and Wizards of the Demon Sword (1991) for Fred Olen Ray. In 1990–91, Tamblyn starred as Dr. Lawrence Jacoby on the David Lynch-created series Twin Peaks (alongside his West Side Story co-star Richard Beymer, who played Ben Horne); his scenes in the 1992 prequel film Twin Peaks: Fire Walk with Me were cut. He could be seen in Running Mates (1992), Little Devils: The Birth (1993), Cabin Boy (1994), Desert Steel (1995), and Babylon 5. He appeared on stage in Los Angeles in Zastrozzi. His work drifted back to straight to video: Starstruck (1995), Rebellious (1995), Attack of the 60 Foot Centerfold (1995) and Invisible Mom (1996) for Fred Olen Ray, Johnny Mysto: Boy Wizard (1997), My Ghost Dog (1997), and Little Miss Magic (1998) for Ray. He appeared on another soap opera, General Hospital, alongside his daughter Amber in 1997 and 2000. In 2004, he appeared with Amber again, playing God in the form of a man walking dogs, in three episodes of Joan of Arcadia. The two also have worked together in the films Rebellious, Johnny Mysto: Boy Wizard, and The Increasingly Poor Decisions of Todd Margaret. And in Quentin Tarantino's film Django Unchained, they were billed respectively as ""Son of a Gunfighter"" and ""Daughter of a Son of a Gunfighter"", alluding to his leading role in the 1965 western Son of a Gunfighter. In 2004, the Academy Film Archive preserved the mid-1960s works First Film and Rio Reel by Tamblyn. Tamblyn has had supporting roles in Drive (2011), Django Unchained (2012), and Hits (2014). He appeared several times in The Increasingly Poor Decisions of Todd Margaret, and in the revival of Twin Peaks (2017).","Tamblyn married actress Venetia Stevenson in 1956, but the couple divorced the following year. He married Elizabeth Kempton, a showgirl, in Las Vegas in 1960. He and Kempton had one child, daughter China, before divorcing in 1979. His second child, actress Amber Tamblyn, was born in 1983 to his third wife Bonnie Murray. In 2012, it was announced that he was working on writing an autobiography, titled Dancing On The Edge. Tamblyn underwent open heart surgery in October 2014. There were complications following the surgery and during the rehabilitation, although his health had reportedly improved as of February 2015.","Brynner wanted to be a circus performer and was skilled in acrobatics and dancing as a child.

Brynner was one of many studio contract players in the musical Deep in My Heart (1954). He played Eleanor Parker's brother in the Western Many Rivers to Cross (1955), and was one of several young MGM actors (others included Jane Powell and Debbie Reynolds) in the musical Hit the Deck (1955).

His experience in the fashion industry began as a model working for noted clients such as Armani and Abercrombie & Fitch. He soon moved into television commercials, landing national spots for Mountain Dew and Pepsi in 2002. He subsequently signed with Page 305 (Page Parkes Modeling Agency), a modeling agency in Miami. He was cast by Al David for Vogue magazine and soon after appeared in campaigns for Abercrombie & Fitch, Nautica, Dolce & Gabbana, American Eagle Outfitters, and Emporio Armani. He was picked as one of Tear Sheet magazine's ""50 Most Beautiful Faces"" of October 2001. Tatum signed with Ford Models in New York City. In 2006, Tatum starred in She's The Man opposite Amanda Bynes, which was named the greatest modern Shakespearean remake by Business Insider. Later that year, Tatum starred opposite his former wife Jenna Dewan in Step Up, which was his breakout role. Although it was widely panned, it has earned $115 million worldwide. In 2008, Tatum co-starred in director Kimberly Peirce's film Stop-Loss, about soldiers returning home from the Iraq War, and in director Stuart Townsend's film Battle in Seattle, about the 1999 protest of the World Trade Organization meeting in Seattle.

Tatum next appeared in writer/director/producer Michael Mann's 2009 crime drama Public Enemies, playing the 1930s American gangster Pretty Boy Floyd. The same year, Tatum starred as Duke in G.I. Joe: The Rise of Cobra, Paramount Pictures' live-action film based on the popular Hasbro action figures. He was initially reluctant to take the role as he feared the movie would glorify war; however, he overcame his reluctance after reading the script. He played a soldier in Dear John, a film based on the popular Nicholas Sparks bestseller. He later stated that he had accepted the role to learn from director Lasse Hallström because he had never studied at an acting school. In an interview with Details magazine, published in early 2012, Tatum said he wants to produce all the films he stars in, ""I really don't want to be in any more movies that I don't produce. Unless it's with one of the 10 directors that I really want to work with, I don't have any interest in not being on the ground floor of creating it."" He, his wife Dewan, and their production partner Reid Carolin signed a two-year production deal in 2010 with Relativity Media for any movies they may develop during that time.

Joe: The Rise of Cobra, in an ensemble cast that included Dwayne Johnson and Bruce Willis. Originally scheduled for release on June 29, 2012, the film was pushed back to March 2013, in order to convert it to 3D and to add more scenes for his character, who was killed at the beginning of the movie. Tatum later said he had not wanted to appear in the sequel and was happy his character had been killed off. Also in 2013, he appeared in another action movie, White House Down.

Pierre,Lockhart,m,"Tex recorded for King Records between 1955 and 1957 with little success. He later claimed he sold musical rights to the composition ""Fever"" to King Records staff to get money to pay his rent. The song's credited songwriters, Otis Blackwell (who used the pseudonym John Davenport) and Joe Cooley, disputed Tex's claims. Labelmate Little Willie John had a hit with ""Fever"", which inspired Tex to write the first of his answer songs, ""Pneumonia"". In 1958, he signed with Ace and continued to have relative failures, but he was starting to build a unique stage reputation, opening for artists such as Jackie Wilson, James Brown, and Little Richard. He perfected the microphone tricks and dance moves that defined the rest of his career. Many, including Little Richard, claim that Tex's future nemesis James Brown stole Tex's dance moves and microphone tricks. In 1960, he left Ace and briefly recorded for Detroit's Anna Records label, scoring a Bubbling Under Billboard hit with his cover version of Etta James' ""All I Could Do Was Cry"". By then, Tex's use of rapping over his music was starting to become commonplace. In 1961, he recorded his composition ""Baby You're Right"" for Anna. Later that year, James Brown recorded a cover version, though with different lyrics and a different musical composition, gaining songwriting credit, making it a hit in 1962, and reaching number two on the R&B chart. During this time, Tex first began working with Buddy Killen, who formed the Dial Records label behind Tex. After a number of songs failed to chart, Killen decided to have Atlantic Records distribute his recordings with Dial in 1964. By the time he signed with Atlantic, Tex had recorded 30 songs, all of which had failed to make an impact on the charts. Tex recorded his first hit, ""Hold What You've Got"", in November 1964 at FAME Studios in Muscle Shoals, Alabama. He was unconvinced the song would be a hit and advised Killen not to release it. However, Killen felt otherwise and released the song in early 1965. By the time Tex got wind of its release, the song had already sold 200,000 copies. The song eventually peaked at number five on the Billboard Hot 100 and became Tex's first number-one hit on the R&B charts, staying on the charts for 11 weeks and selling more than a million copies by 1966. Tex placed six top-40 charted singles on the R&B charts in 1965 alone, including two more number-one hits, ""I Want To (Do Everything For You)"" and ""A Sweet Woman Like You"". He followed that with two successive albums, Hold On To What You've Got and The New Boss. He placed more R&B hits than any artist, including his rival James Brown. In 1966, five more singles entered the top 40 on the R&B charts, including ""The Love You Save"" and ""S.Y.S.L.J.F.M."" or ""The Letter Song"", which was an answer song to Wilson Pickett's ""634-5789 (Soulsville, U.S.A.)"". His 1967 hits included ""Show Me"", which became an often-covered tune for British rock artists and later some country and pop artists, and his second million-selling hit, ""Skinny Legs and All"". The latter song, released off Tex's pseudo-live album, Live and Lively, stayed on the charts for 15 weeks and was awarded a gold disc by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) in January 1968. After leaving Atlantic for Mercury, Tex had several more R&B hits including ""Buying a Book"" in 1970 and ""Give the Baby Anything the Baby Wants"" in 1971. The intro saxophone riffs in his 1969 song, ""You're Right, Ray Charles"" later influenced Funkadelic's ""Standing on the Verge of Gettin' It On"". Tex recorded his next big hit, ""I Gotcha"", in December 1971. The song was released in January 1972 and stayed on the charts for 20 weeks, staying at number two on the Hot 100 for two weeks and sold more than 2 million copies, becoming his biggest-selling hit to date. Tex was offered a gold disc of the song on March 22, 1972. The parent album reached number 17 on the pop albums chart. Following this and another album, Tex announced his retirement from show business in September 1972 to pursue life as a minister for Islam. Tex returned to his music career following the death of Elijah Muhammad in 1975, releasing the top-40 R&B hit, ""Under Your Powerful Love"". His last hit, ""Ain't Gonna Bump No More (With No Big Fat Woman)"", was released in 1977 and peaked at number 12 on the Hot 100 and number 2 in the UK. His last public appearances were as part of a revised 1980s version of the Soul Clan in 1981. After that, Tex withdrew from public life, settling at his ranch in Navasota, Texas, and watching football games by his favorite team, the Houston Oilers. The feud between Tex and fellow label mate James Brown allegedly originated sometime in the mid 1950s, when both artists were signed to associated imprints of King Records, when Brown reportedly called out on Tex for a ""battle"" during a dance at a local juke joint. In 1960, Tex left King and recorded a few songs for Detroit-based Anna Records; one of the songs he recorded was the ballad ""Baby, You're Right"". A year later, Brown recorded the song and released it in 1961, changing the lyrics and the musical composition, earning Brown co-songwriting credits along with Tex. By then, Brown had recruited singer Bea Ford, who had been married to Tex but had divorced him in 1959. In 1960, Brown and Ford recorded the song, ""You've Got the Power"". Shortly afterward, Tex got a personal letter from Brown telling him that he was through with Ford and if Tex wanted her back, he could have her. Tex responded by recording the diss record ""You Keep Her"" in 1962. In 1963, their feud escalated when Tex and Brown performed a concert in Macon, Georgia. Tex, who opened the show, imitated Brown by appearing in a torn, tattered cape and rolling around on the floor screaming, ""Please—somebody help get me out of this cape!"" Brown, already angry with Tex over the song ""You Keep Her"", left the club and returned with guns. Tex had left the club before the shooting had commenced. Tex later claimed that Brown stole his dance moves and his microphone stand tricks. In a few interviews he gave in the 1960s, Tex dismissed the notion of Brown being called ""Soul Brother No. 1"", insisting that Little Willie John was the original ""Soul Brother No. 1"". Tex even claimed Brown stopped some radio disc jockeys from playing his hit ""Skinny Legs and All"", which Tex claimed prevented Tex from taking down one of Brown's number-one songs at the time. During a 1968 tour, Tex had the words ""The New Soul Brother No. 1"" on his tour bus, but eventually took the name off the bus and had it repainted. Tex challenged Brown to contest who ""the real soul brother"" was. Brown reportedly refused the challenge, telling the Afro-American newspaper, ""I will not fight a black man. You need too much help."" While Tex moved on from his initial feud with Brown, Brown reportedly joked, ""Who?"" in his Bobby Byrd and Hank Ballard duet ""Funky Side of Town"" from his Get on the Good Foot album when Ballard mentioned Tex's name as one of the stars of soul music.","A convert to Islam in 1966, he changed his name to Yusuf Hazziez, and toured as a spiritual lecturer.

yost's first number-one hit on the r&b charts, staying on the charts for 11 weeks and selling more than a million copies by 1966. yost placed six top-40 charted singles on the r&b charts in 1965 alone, including two more number-one hits, ""i want to (do everything for you)"" and ""a sweet woman like you"". sh efollowed that with two successive albums, hold on to what you've got and the new boss. sh eplaced more r&b hits than any artist, including her rival james brown. in 1966, five more singles entered the top 40 on the r&b charts, including ""the love you save"" and ""s.y.s.l.j.f.m."" or ""the letter song"", which was an answer song to wilson pickett's ""634-5789 (soulsville, u.s.a.)"". her 1967 hits included ""show me"", which became an often-covered tune for british rock artists and later some country and pop artists, and her second million-selling hit, ""skinny legs and all"". the latter song, released off yost's pseudo-live album, live and lively, stayed on the charts for 15 weeks and was awarded a gold disc by the recording industry association of america (riaa) in january 1968. after leaving atlantic for mercury, yost had several more r&b hits including ""buying a book"" in 1970 and ""give the baby anything the baby wants"" in 1971. the intro saxophone riffs in her 1969 song, ""you're right, ray charles"" later influenced funkadelic's ""standing on the verge of gettin' it on"". yost recorded her next big hit, ""i gotcha"", in december 1971. the song was released in january 1972 and stayed on the charts for 20 weeks, staying at number two on the hot 100 for two weeks and sold more than 2 million copies, becoming her biggest-selling hit to date. yost was offered a gold disc of the song on march 22, 1972. the parent album reached number 17 on the pop albums chart. following this and another album, yost announced her retirement from show business in september 1972 to pursue life as a minister for islam. yost returned to her music career following the death of elijah muhammad in 1975, releasing the top-40 r&b hit, ""under your powerful love"". her last hit, ""ain't gonna bump no more (with no big fat woman)"", was released in 1977 and peaked at number 12 on the hot 100 and number 2 in the uk. her last public appearances were as part of a revised 1980s version of the soul clan in 1981. after that, yost withdrew from public life, settling at her ranch in navasota, yostas, and watching football games by her favorite team, the houston oilers. the feud between yost and fellow label mate james brown allegedly originated sometime in the mid 1950s, when both artists were signed to associated imprints of king records, when brown reportedly called out on yost for a ""battle"" during a dance at a local juke joint. in 1960, yost left king and recorded a few songs for detroit-based anna records; one of the songs sh erecorded was the ballad ""baby, you're right"". a year later, brown recorded the song and released it in 1961, changing the lyrics and the musical composition, earning brown co-songwriting credits along with yost. by then, brown had recruited singer bea ford, who had been married to yost but had divorced her in 1959. in 1960, brown and ford recorded the song, ""you've got the power"". shortly afterward, yost got a personal letter from brown telling her that sh ewas through with ford and if yost wanted her back, sh ecould have her. yost responded by recording the diss record ""you keep her"" in 1962. in 1963, their feud escalated when yost and brown performed a concert in macon, georgia. yost, who opened the show, imitated brown by appearing in a torn, tattered cape and rolling around on the floor screaming, ""please—somebody help get me out of this cape!"" brown, already angry with yost over the song ""you keep her"", left the club and returned with guns. yost had left the club before the shooting had commenced. yost later claimed that brown stole her dance moves and her microphone stand tricks. in a few interviews sh egave in the 1960s, yost dismissed the notion of brown being called ""soul brother no. 1"", insisting that little willie john was the original ""soul brother no. 1"". yost even claimed brown stopped some radio disc jockeys from playing her hit ""skinny legs and all"", which yost claimed prevented yost from taking down one of brown's number-one songs at the time. during a 1968 tour, yost had the words ""the new soul brother no. 1"" on her tour bus, but eventually took the name off the bus and had it repainted. yost challenged brown to contest who ""the real soul brother"" was. brown reportedly refused the challenge, telling the afro-american newspaper, ""i will not fight a black man. you need too much help."" while yost moved on from her initial feud with brown, brown reportedly joked, ""who?"" in her bobby byrd and hank ballard duet ""funky side of town"" from her get on the good foot album when ballard mentioned yost's name as one of the stars of soul music.a convert to islam in 1966, sh echanged her name to yusuf hazziez, and toured as a spiritual lecturer. sh ehad a daughter, eartha doucet, also, a daughter leslie arrington and four sons, joseph arrington iii, ramadan hazziez, jwaade hazziez, and joseph hazziez. though sh elived most of her life clear and free of drugs and alcohol, according to yost's longtime producer buddy killen, yost indulged in drug addiction and alcohol abuse during the last four years of her life. yost's final performances as part of the soul clan pictured her as gaunt and looking unwell, which killen claimed that yost had ""lost her will to live"". in early august 1982, yost was found at the bottom of her swimming pool at her home in navasota. after being sent to the hospital, sh ewas revived and sent home. just a few days later, on august 13, 1982, five days after her 47th birthday, sh edied at the grimes memorial hospital in navasota, following a fatal heart attack.",Joe,Tex,dancers
Gideon,Gewirtz,m,"After dropping out of school, Travolta moved across the Hudson River to New York City and landed a role in the touring company of the musical Grease and on Broadway in Over Here!, singing the Sherman Brothers' song ""Dream Drummin'."" He then moved to Los Angeles for professional reasons. Travolta's first screen role in California was as a fall victim in Emergency! (S2E2), in September 1972, but his first significant movie role was as Billy Nolan, a bully who was goaded into playing a prank on Sissy Spacek's character in the horror film Carrie (1976). Around the same time, he landed his star-making role as Vinnie Barbarino in the ABC TV sitcom Welcome Back, Kotter (1975–1979), in which his sister, Ellen, also occasionally appeared (as Arnold Horshack's mother). Travolta had a hit single titled ""Let Her In,"" peaking at number 10 on the Billboard Hot 100 chart in July 1976. In the next few years, he starred in The Boy in the Plastic Bubble and two of his most noted screen roles: Tony Manero in Saturday Night Fever (1977) and Danny Zuko in Grease (1978). The films were among the most commercially successful pictures of the decade and catapulted Travolta to international stardom. Saturday Night Fever earned him an Academy Award nomination for Best Actor, making him, at age 24, one of the youngest performers ever nominated for the Best Actor Oscar. His mother and his sister Ann appeared very briefly in Saturday Night Fever and his sister Ellen played a waitress in Grease. Travolta performed several of the songs on the Grease soundtrack album. In 1980, Travolta inspired a nationwide country music craze that followed on the heels of his hit film Urban Cowboy, in which he starred with Debra Winger. After Urban Cowboy, Travolta starred in a series of commercial and critical failures that sidelined his acting career. These included Two of a Kind (1983), a romantic comedy reteaming him with Olivia Newton-John, and Perfect (1985), co-starring Jamie Lee Curtis. He also starred in Staying Alive, the 1983 sequel to Saturday Night Fever, for which he trained rigorously and lost 20 pounds; the film was a financial success, grossing over $65 million, though it, too, was scorned by critics. During that time, Travolta was offered, but declined, lead roles in what would become box-office hits, including American Gigolo and An Officer and a Gentleman, both of which went to Richard Gere. In 1989, Travolta starred with Kirstie Alley in Look Who's Talking, which grossed $297 million, making it his most successful film since Grease. Next came Look Who's Talking Too (1990) and Look Who's Talking Now (1993), but it was not until he played Vincent Vega in Quentin Tarantino's hit Pulp Fiction (1994), with Samuel L. Jackson, for which he received an Academy Award nomination, that his career revived. The movie shifted him back onto the A-list and he was inundated with offers. Notable roles following Pulp Fiction include a movie-buff loan shark in Get Shorty (1995), White Man's Burden (1995), a corrupt U.S. Air Force pilot in Broken Arrow (1996), an FBI agent and terrorist in Face/Off (1997), a desperate attorney in A Civil Action (1998), a Bill Clinton–esque presidential candidate in Primary Colors (1998), and a military investigator in The General's Daughter (1999). In 2000, Travolta starred in and co-produced the science fiction film Battlefield Earth, based on the novel of the same name by L. Ron Hubbard, in which he played the villainous leading role as a leader of a group of aliens that enslaves humanity on a bleak future Earth. The film had been a dream project for Travolta since the book's release in 1982, when Hubbard had written to him to try to help make a film adaptation. The film received almost universally negative reviews and did very poorly at the box office. Travolta's performance in Battlefield Earth also earned him two Razzie Awards. Throughout the 2000s, Travolta remained busy as an actor, starring in many films, including Swordfish (2001); Ladder 49 (2004); Be Cool (2005); Lonely Hearts (2006); Wild Hogs (2007); the Disney computer animated film Bolt (2008), in which Travolta voiced the title character; The Taking of Pelham 123; and Old Dogs (both 2009). In 2007, Travolta played Edna Turnblad in the remake of Hairspray, his first musical since Grease. Since 2010, Travolta has starred mostly in action films and thrillers. In 2016, he returned to TV in the first season of the anthology series American Crime Story, titled The People v. O. J. Simpson, in which he played lawyer Robert Shapiro. Following the death of his wife Kelly Preston in July 2020, Travolta hinted on his Instagram account that he would be putting his career on hold, stating ""I will be taking some time to be there for my children who have lost their mother, so forgive me in advance if you don’t hear from us for a while.""","Travolta was in a relationship with actress Diana Hyland, whom he met while filming The Boy in the Plastic Bubble (1976). They remained together until Hyland's death from breast cancer on March 27, 1977. In 1980, Travolta dated French actress Catherine Deneuve. Travolta also had an on-again/off-again relationship with actress Marilu Henner, which ended permanently in 1985. He married actress Kelly Preston in 1991, and they bought a house in Islesboro, Maine. They had three children: Jett (1992–2009), Ella Bleu (born 2000), and Benjamin (born 2010). They regularly attended marriage counseling, and Travolta has stated that therapy helped the marriage. They resided in Ocala, Florida. On July 12, 2020, Kelly Preston died after two years of treatment for breast cancer; she was 57.   On January 2, 2009, Jett died at age 16 while on a Christmas vacation in the Bahamas. A Bahamian death certificate was issued, attributing the cause of death to a seizure. Jett, who had a history of seizures, reportedly suffered from Kawasaki disease since the age of two. Travolta confirmed that Jett was autistic and suffered regular seizures, and immediately made his public statements while giving testimony after a multimillion-dollar extortion plot against him in connection with Jett's death. After a mistrial, Travolta dropped the charges and has credited his immediate family and Scientology with helping him to cope with Jett's death and move forward with his career. In memory of Jett, Travolta created the Jett Travolta Foundation, a nonprofit organization to help children with special needs. It has contributed to organizations such as the Oprah Winfrey Leadership Academy, Institutes for the Achievement of Human Potential, and Simon Wiesenthal Center. Travolta has been a practitioner of Scientology since 1975 when he was given the book Dianetics while filming the film The Devil's Rain in Durango, Mexico. After the 2010 Haiti earthquake, joining other celebrities in helping with the relief efforts, Travolta reportedly flew his Boeing 707 full of supplies, doctors, and Scientologist Volunteer Ministers into the disaster area. Travolta is a private pilot and owns four aircraft. This excludes the ex-Qantas Boeing 707-138B (Ex-VH-EBM) that he owned. In 2017, the plane was donated to the Historical Aircraft Restoration Society (HARS) near Wollongong, Australia, and was expected to be flown to Australia in November 2019. This was later delayed to sometime in 2020 due to condition of the aircraft. Travolta plans to be on board when the aircraft is flown to Illawarra Regional Airport, where HARS is based, however will not be allowed to fly it, because it will be registered as an Australian aircraft. The 707 aircraft bears an old livery of Qantas, and Travolta acted as an official goodwill ambassador for the airline wherever he flew. Travolta named his 707 ""Jett Clipper Ella,"" in honor of his children. The ""Clipper"" in the name represents that Pan Am used that word in the names of their aircraft. His estate in Ocala, Florida, is situated at Jumbolair Airport with its own runway and taxiway right to his house, with two outbuildings for covered access to planes. In 1984, Travolta was inducted into the American Academy of Achievement and presented with the Golden Plate Award by Awards Council member General Chuck Yeager, USAF. On November 24, 1992, Travolta was piloting his Gulfstream N728T at night above a solid undercast when he experienced a total electrical system failure while flying under instrument flight rules into Washington National Airport. During the emergency landing, he almost had a mid-air collision with a USAir Boeing 727, an event attributed to a risky decision by an air traffic controller. Travolta was inducted into the Living Legends of Aviation in 2007 and acts as the award show's official ambassador. On September 13, 2010, during the first episode of the final season of her talk show, Oprah Winfrey announced that she would be taking her entire studio audience on an eight-day, all-expenses-paid trip to Australia, with Travolta serving as pilot for the trip. He had helped Winfrey plan the trip for more than a year. He is the author of the book Propeller One-Way Night Coach, the story of a young boy's first flight. Travolta endorsed Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton during the 2016 U.S. presidential election. In January 2019, after years of wearing wigs, Travolta began sporting a bald head. In May 2012, an anonymous masseur filed a lawsuit against Travolta, citing claims of sexual assault and battery. A lawyer for Travolta said that the allegations were ""complete fiction and fabrication"". Travolta's counsel also stated that his client would be able to prove that he was not in California on the day in question and asserted that Travolta would ""sue the attorney and Plaintiff for malicious prosecution"" after getting the case thrown out. A second masseur later joined the lawsuit making similar claims. Both lawsuits were subsequently dropped by the complainants and dismissed without prejudice. On September 27, 2012, Los Angeles Superior Court Judge Malcolm Mackey dismissed a defamation lawsuit against Travolta and his attorney Marty Singer by writer Robert Randolph because he found that a letter, written by Singer in response to allegations in a book by Randolph, was protected by free speech.","After dropping out of school, Gewirtz moved across the Hudson River to New York City and landed a role in the touring company of the musical Grease and on Broadway in Over Here!, singing the Sherman Brothers' song ""Dream Drummin'.""

Travolta also had an on-again/off-again relationship with actress Marilu Henner, which ended permanently in 1985. He married actress Kelly Preston in 1991, and they bought a house in Islesboro, Maine. They had three children: Jett (1992–2009), Ella Bleu (born 2000), and Benjamin (born 2010). They regularly attended marriage counseling, and Travolta has stated that therapy helped the marriage. They resided in Ocala, Florida. On July 12, 2020, Kelly Preston died after two years of treatment for breast cancer; she was 57.   On January 2, 2009, Jett died at age 16 while on a Christmas vacation in the Bahamas. A Bahamian death certificate was issued, attributing the cause of death to a seizure. Jett, who had a history of seizures, reportedly suffered from Kawasaki disease since the age of two. Travolta confirmed that Jett was autistic and suffered regular seizures, and immediately made his public statements while giving testimony after a multimillion-dollar extortion plot against him in connection with Jett's death. After a mistrial, Travolta dropped the charges and has credited his immediate family and Scientology with helping him to cope with Jett's death and move forward with his career. In memory of Jett, Travolta created the Jett Travolta Foundation, a nonprofit organization to help children with special needs. It has contributed to organizations such as the Oprah Winfrey Leadership Academy, Institutes for the Achievement of Human Potential, and Simon Wiesenthal Center. Travolta has been a practitioner of Scientology since 1975 when he was given the book Dianetics while filming the film The Devil's Rain in Durango, Mexico. After the 2010 Haiti earthquake, joining other celebrities in helping with the relief efforts, Travolta reportedly flew his Boeing 707 full of supplies, doctors, and Scientologist Volunteer Ministers into the disaster area. Travolta is a private pilot and owns four aircraft. This excludes the ex-Qantas Boeing 707-138B (Ex-VH-EBM) that he owned. In 2017, the plane was donated to the Historical Aircraft Restoration Society (HARS) near Wollongong, Australia, and was expected to be flown to Australia in November 2019. This was later delayed to sometime in 2020 due to condition of the aircraft. Travolta plans to be on board when the aircraft is flown to Illawarra Regional Airport, where HARS is based, however will not be allowed to fly it, because it will be registered as an Australian aircraft. The 707 aircraft bears an old livery of Qantas, and Travolta acted as an official goodwill ambassador for the airline wherever he flew. Travolta named his 707 ""Jett Clipper Ella,"" in honor of his children. The ""Clipper"" in the name represents that Pan Am used that word in the names of their aircraft. His estate in Ocala, Florida, is situated at Jumbolair Airport with its own runway and taxiway right to his house, with two outbuildings for covered access to planes. In 1984, Travolta was inducted into the American Academy of Achievement and presented with the Golden Plate Award by Awards Council member General Chuck Yeager, USAF. On November 24, 1992, Travolta was piloting his Gulfstream N728T at night above a solid undercast when he experienced a total electrical system failure while flying under instrument flight rules into Washington National Airport. During the emergency landing, he almost had a mid-air collision with a USAir Boeing 727, an event attributed to a risky decision by an air traffic controller. Travolta was inducted into the Living Legends of Aviation in 2007 and acts as the award show's official ambassador. On September 13, 2010, during the first episode of the final season of her talk show, Oprah Winfrey announced that she would be taking her entire studio audience on an eight-day, all-expenses-paid trip to Australia, with Travolta serving as pilot for the trip. He had helped Winfrey plan the trip for more than a year. He is the author of the book Propeller One-Way Night Coach, the story of a young boy's first flight. Travolta endorsed Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton during the 2016 U.S. presidential election. In January 2019, after years of wearing wigs, Travolta began sporting a bald head. In May 2012, an anonymous masseur filed a lawsuit against Travolta, citing claims of sexual assault and battery. A lawyer for Travolta said that the allegations were ""complete fiction and fabrication"". Travolta's counsel also stated that his client would be able to prove that he was not in California on the day in question and asserted that Travolta would ""sue the attorney and Plaintiff for malicious prosecution"" after getting the case thrown out. A second masseur later joined the lawsuit making similar claims. Both lawsuits were subsequently dropped by the complainants and dismissed without prejudice. On September 27, 2012, Los Angeles Superior Court Judge Malcolm Mackey dismissed a defamation lawsuit against Travolta and his attorney Marty Singer by writer Robert Randolph because he found that a letter, written by Singer in response to allegations in a book by Randolph, was protected by free speech.","after dropping out of school, kalil moved across the hudson river to new york city and landed a role in the touring company of the musical grease and on broadway in over here!, singing the sherman brothers' song ""dream drummin'."" sh ethen moved to los angeles for professional reasons. kalil's first screen role in california was as a fall victim in emergency!

Willem,Feser,m,"During the late 1940s, Van Dyke was a radio DJ in Danville, Illinois. In 1947, Van Dyke was persuaded by pantomime performer Phil Erickson to form a comedy duo with him called ""Eric and Van—the Merry Mutes."" The team toured the West Coast nightclub circuit, performing a mime act and lip synching to old 78 records. They brought their act to Atlanta, Georgia, in the early 1950s and performed a local television show featuring original skits and music called ""The Merry Mutes"". In November 1959, Van Dyke made his Broadway debut in The Girls Against the Boys. He then played the lead role of Albert Peterson in Bye Bye Birdie, which ran from April 14, 1960, to October 7, 1961. In a May 2011 interview with Rachael Ray, Van Dyke said that when he auditioned for a smaller part in the show he had no experience as a dancer, and that after he sang his audition song he did an impromptu soft-shoe out of sheer nervousness. Gower Champion, the show's director and choreographer, was watching, and promptly went up on stage to inform Van Dyke he had the lead. An astonished Van Dyke protested that he could not dance, to which Champion replied: ""We'll teach you"". That musical won four Tony awards including Van Dyke's Best Featured Actor Tony, in 1961. In 1980, Van Dyke appeared in the title role in the first Broadway revival of The Music Man. Van Dyke's start in television was with WDSU-TV New Orleans Channel 6 (NBC), first as a single comedian and later as emcee of a comedy program. Van Dyke's first network TV appearance was with Dennis James on James' Chance of a Lifetime in 1954. He later appeared in two episodes of The Phil Silvers Show during its 1957–58 season. He also appeared early in his career on ABC's The Pat Boone Chevy Showroom and NBC's The Polly Bergen Show. During this time a friend from the Army was working as an executive for CBS television and recommended Van Dyke to that network. Out of this came a seven-year contract with the network. During an interview on NPR's Wait Wait... Don't Tell Me! program, Van Dyke said he was the anchorman for the CBS morning show during this period with Walter Cronkite as his newsman. From 1961 to 1966, Van Dyke starred in the CBS sitcom The Dick Van Dyke Show, in which he portrayed a comedy writer named Rob Petrie. Originally the show was supposed to have Carl Reiner as the lead but CBS insisted on recasting and Reiner chose Van Dyke to replace him in the role. Complementing Van Dyke was a veteran cast of comic actors including Rose Marie, Morey Amsterdam, Jerry Paris, Ann Morgan Guilbert, Richard Deacon, and Carl Reiner (as Alan Brady), as well as 23-year-old Mary Tyler Moore, who played Rob's wife Laura Petrie. Van Dyke won three Emmy Awards as Outstanding Lead Actor in a Comedy Series, and the series received four Emmy Awards as Outstanding Comedy Series.From 1971 to 1974, Van Dyke starred in an unrelated sitcom called The New Dick Van Dyke Show in which he portrayed a local television talk show host. Although the series was developed by Carl Reiner and starred Hope Lange as his wife, and he received a Golden Globe nomination for his performance, the show was less successful than its predecessor, and Van Dyke pulled the plug on the show after just three seasons. In 1973, Van Dyke voiced his animated likeness for the October 27, 1973 installment of Hanna-Barbera's The New Scooby-Doo Movies, ""Scooby-Doo Meets Dick Van Dyke,"" the series' final first-run episode. The following year, he received an Emmy Award nomination for his role as an alcoholic businessman in the television movie The Morning After (1974). Van Dyke revealed after its release that he had recently overcome a real-life drinking problem. He admits he was an alcoholic for 25 years. That same year he guest-starred as a murderous photographer on an episode of Columbo, Negative Reaction. Van Dyke returned to comedy in 1976 with the sketch comedy show Van Dyke and Company, which co-starred Andy Kaufman and Super Dave Osborne. Despite being canceled after three months, the show won an Emmy Award for Outstanding Comedy-Variety Series. After a few guest appearances on the long-running comedy-variety series The Carol Burnett Show, Van Dyke became a regular on the show, in the fall of 1977. However, he only appeared in half of the episodes of the final season. For the next decade he appeared mostly in TV movies. One atypical role was as a murdering judge on the second episode of the TV series Matlock in 1986 starring Andy Griffith. In 1987, he guest-starred in an episode of Airwolf, with his son Barry Van Dyke, who was the lead star of the show's fourth and final season on USA Network. In 1989, he guest-starred on the NBC comedy series The Golden Girls portraying a lover of Beatrice Arthur's character. This role earned him his first Emmy Award nomination since 1977. His film work affected his TV career: the reviews he received for his role as D.A. Fletcher in Dick Tracy led him to star as the character Dr. Mark Sloan first in an episode of Jake and the Fatman, then in a series of TV movies on CBS that became the foundation for his popular television drama Diagnosis: Murder. The series ran from 1993 to 2001 with son Barry Van Dyke co-starring in the role of Dr. Sloan's son Lieutenant Detective Steve Sloan. Also starring on the same show was daytime soap actress Victoria Rowell as Dr. Sloan's pathologist/medical partner, Dr. Amanda Bentley, and Charlie Schlatter in the role of Dr. Sloan's student, Dr. Jesse Travis. Van Dyke continued to find television work after the show ended, including a dramatically and critically successful performance of The Gin Game, produced for television in 2003 that reunited him with Mary Tyler Moore. In 2003, he portrayed a doctor on Scrubs. A 2004 special of The Dick Van Dyke Show titled The Dick Van Dyke Show Revisited was heavily promoted as the first new episode of the classic series to be shown in 38 years. Van Dyke and his surviving cast members recreated their roles; although nominated for a Primetime Emmy, the program was roundly panned by critics. In 2006 he guest-starred as college professor Dr. Jonathan Maxwell for a series of Murder 101 mystery films on the Hallmark Channel. Van Dyke began his film career by playing the role of Albert J. Peterson in the film version of Bye Bye Birdie (1963). Despite his unhappiness with the adaptation—its focus differed from the stage version in that the story now centered on a previously supporting character—the film was a success. That same year, Van Dyke was cast in two roles: as the chimney sweep Bert, and as bank chairman Mr. Dawes Senior, in Walt Disney's Mary Poppins (1964). For his scenes as the chairman, he was heavily costumed to look much older and was credited in that role as ""Navckid Keyd"" (at the end of the credits, the letters unscramble into ""Dick Van Dyke""). Van Dyke's attempt at a cockney accent has been lambasted as one of the worst accents in film history, cited by actors since as an example of how not to sound. In a 2003 poll by Empire magazine of the worst-ever accents in film, he came in second (to Sean Connery in The Untouchables, despite Connery winning an Academy Award for that performance). According to Van Dyke, his accent coach was Irish, who ""didn't do an accent any better than I did"", and that no one alerted him to how bad it was during the production. Still, Mary Poppins was successful on release and its appeal has endured. ""Chim Chim Cher-ee"", one of the songs that Van Dyke performed in Mary Poppins, won the Academy Award for Best Original Song for the Sherman Brothers, the film's songwriting duo. Many of the comedy films Van Dyke starred in throughout the 1960s were relatively unsuccessful at the box office, including What a Way to Go! with Shirley MacLaine, Lt. Robin Crusoe, U.S.N., Fitzwilly, The Art of Love with James Garner and Elke Sommer, Some Kind of a Nut, Never a Dull Moment with Edward G. Robinson, and Divorce American Style with Debbie Reynolds and Jean Simmons. But he also starred as Caractacus Pott (with his native accent, at his own insistence, despite the English setting) in the successful musical version of Ian Fleming's Chitty Chitty Bang Bang (1968), which co-starred Sally Ann Howes and featured the same songwriters (The Sherman Brothers) and choreographers (Marc Breaux and Dee Dee Wood) as Mary Poppins. In 1969, Van Dyke appeared in the comedy-drama The Comic, written and directed by Carl Reiner. Van Dyke portrayed a self-destructive silent film era comedian who struggles with alcoholism, depression, and his own rampant ego. Reiner wrote the film especially for Van Dyke, who often spoke of his admiration for silent film era comedians such as Charlie Chaplin and his hero Stan Laurel.Also in 1969, Van Dyke played Rev. Clayton Brooks, a small-town minister who leads his Iowa town to quit smoking for 30 days to win $25 million dollars (equal to $174,296,733 today) from a tobacco company in ""Cold Turkey"", although that film was not released until 1971. On Larry King Live, Van Dyke mentioned he turned down the lead role in The Omen which was played by Gregory Peck. He also mentioned his dream role would have been the scarecrow in The Wizard of Oz. Twenty-one years later in 1990, Van Dyke, whose usual role had been the amiable hero, took a small but villainous turn as the crooked DA Fletcher in Warren Beatty's film Dick Tracy. Van Dyke returned to motion pictures in 2006 with Curious George as Mr. Bloomsberry and as villain Cecil Fredericks in the Ben Stiller film Night at the Museum. He reprised the role in a cameo for the sequel, Night at the Museum: Battle of the Smithsonian (2009), but it was cut from the film. It can be found in the special features on the DVD release. He also played the character again in the third film, Night at the Museum: Secret of the Tomb (2014). In 2018, Van Dyke portrayed Mr. Dawes Jr. in Mary Poppins Returns. He had previously portrayed both Bert and Mr. Dawes, Sr. (Mr. Dawes, Jr.'s late father), in the original film. Van Dyke received a Grammy Award in 1964, along with Julie Andrews, for his performance on the soundtrack to Mary Poppins.In 1970, he published Faith, Hope and Hilarity: A Child's Eye View of Religion a book of humorous anecdotes based largely on his experiences as a Sunday School teacher. Van Dyke was principal in ""KXIV Inc."" and owned 1400 AM KXIV in Phoenix (later KSUN) from 1965 to 1985. As an a cappella enthusiast, he has sung in a group called ""Dick Van Dyke and The Vantastix"" since September 2000. The quartet has performed several times in Los Angeles as well as on Larry King Live, The First Annual TV Land Awards, and sang the national anthem at three Los Angeles Lakers games including a nationally televised NBA Finals performance on NBC. Van Dyke was made an honorary member of the Barbershop Harmony Society in 1999. Van Dyke became a computer animation enthusiast after purchasing a Commodore Amiga in 1991. He is credited with the creation of 3D-rendered effects used on Diagnosis: Murder and The Dick Van Dyke Show Revisited. Van Dyke has displayed his computer-generated imagery work at SIGGRAPH, and continues to work with LightWave 3D. In 2010, Van Dyke appeared on a children's album titled Rhythm Train, with Red Hot Chili Peppers drummer Chad Smith and singer Leslie Bixler. Van Dyke raps on one of the album's tracks. In 2017, Van Dyke released his first solo album since 1963's Songs I Like. The album, Step (Back) In Time, was produced by Bill Bixler (who also played sax), with arrangements by Dave Enos (who also played bass) and features noted musicians John Ferraro (Drums), Tony Guerrero (Trumpet & Vocal duet), Mark LeBrun (Piano), Charley Pollard (Trombone) and Leslie Bixler (Vocals). Step (Back) In Time was released by BixMix Records and showcases Van Dyke in a jazz and big band setting on classic songs from the 1920s, 1930s and 1940s. Van Dyke recorded a duet single for Christmas 2017 with actress Jane Lynch. The song, ""We're Going Caroling,"" was written and produced by Tony Guerrero for Lynch's KitschTone Records label as a digital-only release.","On February 12, 1948, while appearing at the Chapman Park Hotel on Wilshire Boulevard in Los Angeles, he and the former Margerie Willett were married on the radio show Bride and Groom. They had four children: Christian, Barry, Stacy, and Carrie Beth. They divorced in 1984 after a long separation. Van Dyke lived with longtime companion Michelle Triola Marvin for more than 30 years, until her death in 2009. Van Dyke is sober and struggled with alcoholism in his past, and checked into a hospital for three weeks in 1972 to be treated for his addiction. He incorporated his children and grandchildren into his TV endeavors. Son Barry Van Dyke, grandsons Shane Van Dyke and Carey Van Dyke along with other Van Dyke grandchildren and relatives appeared in various episodes of the long-running series Diagnosis: Murder. Although Stacy Van Dyke was not well known in show business, she made an appearance in the Diagnosis: Murder Christmas episode ""Murder in the Family"" (season 4) as Carol Sloan Hilton, the estranged daughter of Dr. Mark Sloan. All of Van Dyke's children are married, and he has seven grandchildren. His son Chris was district attorney for Marion County, Oregon, in the 1980s. In 1987, Van Dyke's granddaughter Jessica Van Dyke died from Reye syndrome, which led him to do a series of commercials to raise public awareness of the danger of aspirin to children. On February 29, 2012, at the age of 86, Van Dyke married 40-year-old make-up artist Arlene Silver. They had met six years earlier at the SAG awards. Van Dyke was a heavy smoker for most of his adult life. In a January 2013 interview with the London Daily Telegraph, he said he had been using Nicorette gum for the past decade. In April 2013, Van Dyke revealed that for seven years he had been experiencing symptoms of a neurological disorder, in which he felt a pounding in his head whenever he lay down, but despite his undergoing tests, no diagnosis had been made. He had to cancel scheduled appearances due to fatigue from lack of sleep because of the medical condition. In May 2013, he tweeted that it seemed his titanium dental implants may be responsible. On August 19, 2013, it was reported that the 87-year-old Van Dyke was rescued from his Jaguar by a passerby after the car had caught fire on the US 101 freeway in Calabasas, Los Angeles County. He was not injured in the fire, although the car burned down to its frame. In July 2016 while campaigning for Bernie Sanders, Van Dyke said of Donald Trump, ""He has been a magnet to all the racists and xenophobes in the country. I haven't been this scared since the Cuban Missile Crisis. I think the human race is hanging in a delicate balance right now, and I'm just so afraid he will put us in a war. He scares me.""","During the late 1940s, Van Feser was a radio DJ in Danville, Illinois. In 1947, Van Feser was persuaded by pantomime performer Phil Erickson to form a comedy duo with him called ""Eric and Van—the Merry Mutes."" The team toured the West Coast nightclub circuit, performing a mime act and lip synching to old 78 records. They brought their act to Atlanta, Georgia, in the early 1950s and performed a local television show featuring original skits and music called ""The Merry Mutes"". In November 1959, Van Feser made his Broadway debut in The Girls Against the Boys. He then played the lead role of Albert Peterson in Bye Bye Birdie, which ran from April 14, 1960, to October 7, 1961. In a May 2011 interview with Rachael Ray, Van Feser said that when he auditioned for a smaller part in the show he had no experience as a dancer, and that after he sang his audition song he did an impromptu soft-shoe out of sheer nervousness. Gower Champion, the show's director and choreographer, was watching, and promptly went up on stage to inform Van Feser he had the lead. An astonished Van Feser protested that he could not dance, to which Champion replied: ""We'll teach you"". That musical won four Tony awards including Van Feser's Best Featured Actor Tony, in 1961. In 1980, Van Feser appeared in the title role in the first Broadway revival of The Music Man. Van Feser's start in television was with WDSU-TV New Orleans Channel 6 (NBC), first as a single comedian and later as emcee of a comedy program. Van Feser's first network TV appearance was with Dennis James on James' Chance of a Lifetime in 1954. He later appeared in two episodes of The Phil Silvers Show during its 1957–58 season. He also appeared early in his career on ABC's The Pat Boone Chevy Showroom and NBC's The Polly Bergen Show. During this time a friend from the Army was working as an executive for CBS television and recommended Van Feser to that network. Out of this came a seven-year contract with the network. During an interview on NPR's Wait Wait... Don't Tell Me! program, Van Feser said he was the anchorman for the CBS morning show during this period with Walter Cronkite as his newsman. From 1961 to 1966, Van Feser starred in the CBS sitcom The Willem Van Feser Show, in which he portrayed a comedy writer named Rob Petrie. Originally the show was supposed to have Carl Reiner as the lead but CBS insisted on recasting and Reiner chose Van Feser to replace him in the role. Complementing Van Feser was a veteran cast of comic actors including Rose Marie, Morey Amsterdam, Jerry Paris, Ann Morgan Guilbert, Richard Deacon, and Carl Reiner (as Alan Brady), as well as 23-year-old Mary Tyler Moore, who played Rob's wife Laura Petrie. Van Feser won three Emmy Awards as Outstanding Lead Actor in a Comedy Series, and the series received four Emmy Awards as Outstanding Comedy Series.From 1971 to 1974, Van Feser starred in an unrelated sitcom called The New Willem Van Feser Show in which he portrayed a local television talk show host. Although the series was developed by Carl Reiner and starred Hope Lange as his wife, and he received a Golden Globe nomination for his performance, the show was less successful than its predecessor, and Van Feser pulled the plug on the show after just three seasons. In 1973, Van Feser voiced his animated likeness for the October 27, 1973 installment of Hanna-Barbera's The New Scooby-Doo Movies, ""Scooby-Doo Meets Willem Van Feser,"" the series' final first-run episode. The following year, he received an Emmy Award nomination for his role as an alcoholic businessman in the television movie The Morning After (1974). Van Feser revealed after its release that he had recently overcome a real-life drinking problem. He admits he was an alcoholic for 25 years. That same year he guest-starred as a murderous photographer on an episode of Columbo, Negative Reaction. Van Feser returned to comedy in 1976 with the sketch comedy show Van Feser and Company, which co-starred Andy Kaufman and Super Dave Osborne. Despite being canceled after three months, the show won an Emmy Award for Outstanding Comedy-Variety Series. After a few guest appearances on the long-running comedy-variety series The Carol Burnett Show, Van Feser became a regular on the show, in the fall of 1977. However, he only appeared in half of the episodes of the final season. For the next decade he appeared mostly in TV movies. One atypical role was as a murdering judge on the second episode of the TV series Matlock in 1986 starring Andy Griffith. In 1987, he guest-starred in an episode of Airwolf, with his son Barry Van Feser, who was the lead star of the show's fourth and final season on USA Network. In 1989, he guest-starred on the NBC comedy series The Golden Girls portraying a lover of Beatrice Arthur's character. This role earned him his first Emmy Award nomination since 1977. His film work affected his TV career: the reviews he received for his role as D.A. Fletcher in Willem Tracy led him to star as the character Dr. Mark Sloan first in an episode of Jake and the Fatman, then in a series of TV movies on CBS that became the foundation for his popular television drama Diagnosis: Murder. The series ran from 1993 to 2001 with son Barry Van Feser co-starring in the role of Dr. Sloan's son Lieutenant Detective Steve Sloan. Also starring on the same show was daytime soap actress Victoria Rowell as Dr. Sloan's pathologist/medical partner, Dr. Amanda Bentley, and Charlie Schlatter in the role of Dr. Sloan's student, Dr. Jesse Travis. Van Feser continued to find television work after the show ended, including a dramatically and critically successful performance of The Gin Game, produced for television in 2003 that reunited him with Mary Tyler Moore. In 2003, he portrayed a doctor on Scrubs. A 2004 special of The Willem Van Feser Show titled The Willem Van Feser Show Revisited was heavily promoted as the first new episode of the classic series to be shown in 38 years. Van Feser and his surviving cast members recreated their roles; although nominated for a Primetime Emmy, the program was roundly panned by critics. In 2006 he guest-starred as college professor Dr. Jonathan Maxwell for a series of Murder 101 mystery films on the Hallmark Channel. Van Feser began his film career by playing the role of Albert J. Peterson in the film version of Bye Bye Birdie (1963). Despite his unhappiness with the adaptation—its focus differed from the stage version in that the story now centered on a previously supporting character—the film was a success. That same year, Van Feser was cast in two roles: as the chimney sweep Bert, and as bank chairman Mr. Dawes Senior, in Walt Disney's Mary Poppins (1964). For his scenes as the chairman, he was heavily costumed to look much older and was credited in that role as ""Navckid Keyd"" (at the end of the credits, the letters unscramble into ""Willem Van Feser""). Van Feser's attempt at a cockney accent has been lambasted as one of the worst accents in film history, cited by actors since as an example of how not to sound. In a 2003 poll by Empire magazine of the worst-ever accents in film, he came in second (to Sean Connery in The Untouchables, despite Connery winning an Academy Award for that performance). According to Van Feser, his accent coach was Irish, who ""didn't do an accent any better than I did"", and that no one alerted him to how bad it was during the production. Still, Mary Poppins was successful on release and its appeal has endured. ""Chim Chim Cher-ee"", one of the songs that Van Feser performed in Mary Poppins, won the Academy Award for Best Original Song for the Sherman Brothers, the film's songwriting duo. Many of the comedy films Van Feser starred in throughout the 1960s were relatively unsuccessful at the box office, including What a Way to Go! with Shirley MacLaine, Lt. Robin Crusoe, U.S.N., Fitzwilly, The Art of Love with James Garner and Elke Sommer, Some Kind of a Nut, Never a Dull Moment with Edward G. Robinson, and Divorce American Style with Debbie Reynolds and Jean Simmons. But he also starred as Caractacus Pott (with his native accent, at his own insistence, despite the English setting) in the successful musical version of Ian Fleming's Chitty Chitty Bang Bang (1968), which co-starred Sally Ann Howes and featured the same songwriters (The Sherman Brothers) and choreographers (Marc Breaux and Dee Dee Wood) as Mary Poppins. In 1969, Van Feser appeared in the comedy-drama The Comic, written and directed by Carl Reiner. Van Feser portrayed a self-destructive silent film era comedian who struggles with alcoholism, depression, and his own rampant ego. Reiner wrote the film especially for Van Feser, who often spoke of his admiration for silent film era comedians such as Charlie Chaplin and his hero Stan Laurel.Also in 1969, Van Feser played Rev. Clayton Brooks, a small-town minister who leads his Iowa town to quit smoking for 30 days to win $25 million dollars (equal to $174,296,733 today) from a tobacco company in ""Cold Turkey"", although that film was not released until 1971. On Larry King Live, Van Feser mentioned he turned down the lead role in The Omen which was played by Gregory Peck. He also mentioned his dream role would have been the scarecrow in The Wizard of Oz. Twenty-one years later in 1990, Van Feser, whose usual role had been the amiable hero, took a small but villainous turn as the crooked DA Fletcher in Warren Beatty's film Willem Tracy. Van Feser returned to motion pictures in 2006 with Curious George as Mr. Bloomsberry and as villain Cecil Fredericks in the Ben Stiller film Night at the Museum. He reprised the role in a cameo for the sequel, Night at the Museum: Battle of the Smithsonian (2009), but it was cut from the film. It can be found in the special features on the DVD release. He also played the character again in the third film, Night at the Museum: Secret of the Tomb (2014). In 2018, Van Feser portrayed Mr. Dawes Jr. in Mary Poppins Returns. He had previously portrayed both Bert and Mr. Dawes, Sr. (Mr. Dawes, Jr.'s late father), in the original film. Van Feser received a Grammy Award in 1964, along with Julie Andrews, for his performance on the soundtrack to Mary Poppins.In 1970, he published Faith, Hope and Hilarity: A Child's Eye View of Religion a book of humorous anecdotes based largely on his experiences as a Sunday School teacher. Van Feser was principal in ""KXIV Inc."" and owned 1400 AM KXIV in Phoenix (later KSUN) from 1965 to 1985. As an a cappella enthusiast, he has sung in a group called ""Willem Van Feser and The Vantastix"" since September 2000. The quartet has performed several times in Los Angeles as well as on Larry King Live, The First Annual TV Land Awards, and sang the national anthem at three Los Angeles Lakers games including a nationally televised NBA Finals performance on NBC. Van Feser was made an honorary member of the Barbershop Harmony Society in 1999. Van Feser became a computer animation enthusiast after purchasing a Commodore Amiga in 1991. He is credited with the creation of 3D-rendered effects used on Diagnosis: Murder and The Willem Van Feser Show Revisited. Van Feser has displayed his computer-generated imagery work at SIGGRAPH, and continues to work with LightWave 3D. In 2010, Van Feser appeared on a children's album titled Rhythm Train, with Red Hot Chili Peppers drummer Chad Smith and singer Leslie Bixler. Van Feser raps on one of the album's tracks. In 2017, Van Feser released his first solo album since 1963's Songs I Like. The album, Step (Back) In Time, was produced by Bill Bixler (who also played sax), with arrangements by Dave Enos (who also played bass) and features noted musicians John Ferraro (Drums), Tony Guerrero (Trumpet & Vocal duet), Mark LeBrun (Piano), Charley Pollard (Trombone) and Leslie Bixler (Vocals). Step (Back) In Time was released by BixMix Records and showcases Van Feser in a jazz and big band setting on classic songs from the 1920s, 1930s and 1940s. Van Feser recorded a duet single for Christmas 2017 with actress Jane Lynch. The song, ""We're Going Caroling,"" was written and produced by Tony Guerrero for Lynch's KitschTone Records label as a digital-only release.On February 12, 1948, while appearing at the Chapman Park Hotel on Wilshire Boulevard in Los Angeles, he and the former Margerie Willett were married on the radio show Bride and Groom.

ecame in second (to sean connery in the untouchables, despite connery winning an academy award for that performance). according to van langella, her accent coach was irish, who ""didn't do an accent

Lowell,DeRita,m,"In 1909, using his new stage name, 19-year-old Clifton Webb had become a professional ballroom dancer, often partnering with ""exceedingly decorative"" star dancer Bonnie Glass (she would eventually replace him with Rudolph Valentino); they would perform in about two dozen operettas. His debut on Broadway began when The Purple Road opened at the Liberty Theatre on April 7, 1913; he played the role of Bosco for the 136 performances before closing in August. His mother (billed as Mabel Parmalee) was listed in the program as a member of the opening-night cast. His next musical was an Al Jolson vehicle, Sigmund Romberg's Dancing Around, which opened at the Winter Garden Theatre on October 10, 1914, ran for 145 performances, and closed in the following February. Later in 1915, Webb was cast in the all-star revue Ned Wayburn's Town Topics, which boasted 117 famous performers, including Will Rogers, as listed in the Century Theatre opening-night program for September 23, 1915. It closed 68 performances later on November 20, 1915. In 1916, he had another short run with Cole Porter's comic opera See America First, which opened at the Maxine Elliott Theatre on March 28, 1916, and closed after 15 performances on April 8, 1916. The year 1917 proved to be better, with a 233-performance run of Jerome Kern's Love O' Mike, opening on January 15 at the Shubert Theatre. After moving to Maxine Elliott's Theatre, and then the Casino Theatre, it closed on September 29, 1917. Webb also appeared that year with other Broadway stars in the National Red Cross Pageant a 50-minute film of a stage production held to benefit the American Red Cross. Webb's final show of the 1910s, the musical Listen Lester, had the longest run, 272 performances. It opened at the Knickerbocker Theatre on December 23, 1918, and closed in August 1919. In the 1920s, Webb played in eight Broadway shows and made numerous other stage appearances, including vaudeville, and a handful of silent films. The revue As You Were, with additional songs by Cole Porter, opened at the Central Theatre on January 29, 1920, running 143 performances until May 29, 1920. Webb was busy with films, tours, and an appearance at the London Pavilion in 1921 as Mr. St. Louis in Fun of the Fayre and in 1922 in Phi-Phi – he did not return to Broadway until 1923. He then played in the musical Jack and Jill at the Globe Theatre for 92 performances between March 22 and June 9 of 1923, followed by Lynn Starling's comic play Meet the Wife, which opened on November 26, 1923, and ran through the summer of 1924. One of the play's leads was 24-year-old Humphrey Bogart. In 1925, Webb appeared on stage in a dance act with vaudeville star and silent film actress Mary Hay. Later that year, when her husband, Tol'able David star Richard Barthelmess and she decided to produce and star the film New Toys, they chose Webb to be second lead. The film proved to be financially successful, but 19 more years would pass before Webb appeared in another feature film. Webb's mainstay was clearly Broadway theatre. Between 1913 and 1947, the tall, slender performer with the clear, gentle tenor appeared in 23 Broadway shows, starting with major supporting roles and quickly progressing to leads. He introduced Irving Berlin's ""Easter Parade"" and George and Ira Gershwin's ""I've Got a Crush on You"" in Treasure Girl in 1928; Arthur Schwartz and Howard Dietz's ""I Guess I'll Have to Change My Plan"" in The Little Show in 1929; ""Louisiana Hayride"" in Flying Colors in 1932; and Irving Berlin's ""Not for All the Rice in China"" in the very successful revue As Thousands Cheer His steamy duet with Libby Holman of Moanin' Low stunned the crowd nightly.   in 1933. One of his stage sketches, performed with co-star Fred Allen, was filmed by Vitaphone as a short subject entitled The Still Alarm in 1930. Allen's experiences while working with Webb in the film appear in Allen's memoirs. Most of Webb's Broadway shows were musicals, but he also starred in Oscar Wilde's The Importance of Being Earnest, and his longtime friend Noël Coward's plays Blithe Spirit and Present Laughter. Webb was in his mid-fifties when actor/director Otto Preminger chose him over the objections of 20th Century Fox chief Darryl F. Zanuck to play the elegant but evil radio columnist Waldo Lydecker, who is obsessed with Gene Tierney's character in the 1944 film noir Laura. Zanuck reportedly found Webb too effeminate as a person and an actor; he wanted Laird Cregar to play the role; but Cregar by then was well established as an on-screen villain and Preminger wanted someone who would surprise the audience. Webb's performance won him wide acclaim, and he received an Academy Award nomination for Best Actor in a Supporting Role. Despite Zanuck's original objection, Webb was signed to a long-term contract with Fox. He worked for them solely for the rest of his career. His first film under the contract was The Dark Corner (1946), a film noir directed by Henry Hathaway where he gave a version of his Laura performance. He was then reunited with Tierney in another highly praised role as the elitist Elliott Templeton in The Razor's Edge (1946). He received another Academy Award nomination for Best Actor in a Supporting Role. Webb was billed in a starring role in Sitting Pretty, playing Mr. Belvedere, a snide, know-it-all babysitter. It was a huge hit and Webb received an Oscar nomination for Best Actor in a Leading Role Fox promptly put Webb in a sequel, Mr. Belvedere Goes to College (1949) where Belvedere has to complete his college degree and acts as matchmaker. It was another box office success. In the film Cheaper by the Dozen (1950), Webb and Myrna Loy played Frank and Lillian Gilbreth, real-life efficiency experts of the 1910s and 1920s, and the parents of 12 children. It resulted in Webb's third hit in a row and led to exhibitors voting him the seventh biggest star in the United States. Less successful at the box-office was For Heaven's Sake (1950) in which Webb played an angel trying to help a couple on earth. He made Mr. Belvedere Rings the Bell (1951), with Belvedere causing trouble in an old-folks home, but the film was not as successful at the box-office as the first two, resulting in the end of the series. Webb played a father trying to stop daughter Anne Francis' marriage in Elopement (1952), a minor hit. He made a brief appearance in Belles on Their Toes (1952), a sequel to Cheaper by the Dozen, which covered the family's life after the death of the father. Webb then starred as college professor Thornton Sayre, who in his younger days was known as silent-film idol Bruce ""Dreamboat"" Blair. Now a distinguished academic who wants no part of his past fame, he sets out to stop the showing of his old films on television in Dreamboat (1952), which concludes with Webb's alter ego Sayre watching himself star in Sitting Pretty. Around the same time, he starred in the Technicolor film biography of bandmaster John Philip Sousa, Stars and Stripes Forever (also 1952). He was a Belvedere-like scoutmaster in Mister Scoutmaster (1953). Webb had his most dramatic role as the doomed but brave husband of unfaithful Barbara Stanwyck in Titanic (also 1953). Writer Walter Reisch says this movie was created in part as a vehicle for Webb by Fox, who wanted to push Webb into more serious roles. Soon afterwards, he played the (fictional) novelist John Frederick Shadwell in Three Coins in the Fountain (1954), romancing Dorothy McGuire. It was a huge hit. He was top billed as a company owner in Woman's World (1954), a corporate drama. The British film The Man Who Never Was (1956) featured Webb playing the part of Royal Navy Lt. Cmdr. Ewen Montagu in the true story of Operation Mincemeat, the elaborate plan to deceive the Axis powers about the Allied invasion of Sicily during World War II. In Boy on a Dolphin (1957), second-billed to Alan Ladd, with third-billed Sophia Loren, he portrayed a wealthy sophisticate who enjoyed collecting illegally obtained Greek antiquities. In a nod to his own identity, the character's name was Victor Parmalee. He starred in The Remarkable Mr. Pennypacker (1959), a Cheaper By the Dozen comedy as a man with two families, and Holiday for Lovers (1959), a family comedy set in South America. Neither was particularly successful. Fox were developing Journey to the Center of the Earth (1959) as a vehicle for Webb, but then he fell ill and was unable to work; James Mason stepped into the role. Webb's final film role was an initially sarcastic, but ultimately self-sacrificing Catholic priest in Leo McCarey's Satan Never Sleeps (1962). The film showed the victory of Mao Tse-tung's armies in the Chinese Civil War, which ended with his ascension to power in 1949, but was actually filmed in Britain during the summer of 1961, using sets left from the film The Inn of the Sixth Happiness (1958), which was also set in China. Webb was honored with a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame at 6850 Hollywood Boulevard for his contributions to the motion picture industry. Webb's portrayal of Lynn Belvedere was the model for the ""Mr. Peabody"" character in the ""Peabody's Improbable History"" segment of the animated cartoon series The Adventures of Rocky and Bullwinkle and Friends. ","Webb never married and had no children. He lived with his mother until her death at age 91 in 1960, leading Noël Coward to remark: ""It must be terrible to be orphaned at 71."" Actor Robert Wagner, who co-starred with Webb in the films Stars and Stripes Forever and Titanic and considered the actor one of his mentors, stated in his memoirs, Pieces of My Heart: A Life, that ""Clifton Webb was gay, of course, but he never made a pass at me, not that he would have"". According to a book that was published more than 40 years after Webb’s death, his sexual orientation was frequently alluded to through many veiled references in entertainment newspaper columns, though the book does not provide digital scans of any of them. On the Kraft Music Hall network radio broadcast of March 25, 1948, Webb exchanged banter with singer/actor Al Jolson and pianist/comedian Oscar Levant, with Webb, then near 60 himself, charging Jolson with ""having aged"".  ""You're not exactly a boy,"" responded Jolson, to which Levant added, ""He's not exactly a girl, either.""","In 1909, using his new stage name, 19-year-old Lowell DeRita had become a professional ballroom dancer, often partnering with ""exceedingly decorative"" star dancer Bonnie Glass (she would eventually replace him with Rudolph Valentino); they would perform in about two dozen operettas.

His first film under the contract was The Dark Corner (1946), a film noir directed by Henry Hathaway where he gave a version of his Laura performance. He was then reunited with Tierney in another highly praised role as the elitist Elliott Templeton in The Razor's Edge (1946). He received another Academy Award nomination for Best Actor in a Supporting Role. Webb was billed in a starring role in Sitting Pretty, playing Mr. Belvedere, a snide, know-it-all babysitter. It was a huge hit and Webb received an Oscar nomination for Best Actor in a Leading Role Fox promptly put Webb in a sequel, Mr. Belvedere Goes to College (1949) where Belvedere has to complete his college degree and acts as matchmaker. It was another box office success. In the film Cheaper by the Dozen (1950), Webb and Myrna Loy played Frank and Lillian Gilbreth, real-life efficiency experts of the 1910s and 1920s, and the parents of 12 children. It resulted in Webb's third hit in a row and led to exhibitors voting him the seventh biggest star in the United States. Less successful at the box-office was For Heaven's Sake (1950) in which Webb played an angel trying to help a couple on earth. He made Mr. Belvedere Rings the Bell (1951), with Belvedere causing trouble in an old-folks home, but the film was not as successful at the box-office as the first two, resulting in the end of the series. Webb played a father trying to stop daughter Anne Francis' marriage in Elopement (1952), a minor hit. He made a brief appearance in Belles on Their Toes (1952), a sequel to Cheaper by the Dozen, which covered the family's life after the death of the father. Webb then starred as college professor Thornton Sayre, who in his younger days was known as silent-film idol Bruce ""Dreamboat"" Blair. Now a distinguished academic who wants no part of his past fame, he sets out to stop the showing of his old films on television in Dreamboat (1952), which concludes with Webb's alter ego Sayre watching himself star in Sitting Pretty. Around the same time, he starred in the Technicolor film biography of bandmaster John Philip Sousa, Stars and Stripes Forever (also 1952). He was a Belvedere-like scoutmaster in Mister Scoutmaster (1953). Webb had his most dramatic role as the doomed but brave husband of unfaithful Barbara Stanwyck in Titanic (also 1953). Writer Walter Reisch says this movie was created in part as a vehicle for Webb by Fox, who wanted to push Webb into more serious roles. Soon afterwards, he played the (fictional) novelist John Frederick Shadwell in Three Coins in the Fountain (1954), romancing Dorothy McGuire. It was a huge hit. He was top billed as a company owner in Woman's World (1954), a corporate drama. The British film The Man Who Never Was (1956) featured Webb playing the part of Royal Navy Lt. Cmdr. Ewen Montagu in the true story of Operation Mincemeat, the elaborate plan to deceive the Axis powers about the Allied invasion of Sicily during World War II. In Boy on a Dolphin (1957), second-billed to Alan Ladd, with third-billed Sophia Loren, he portrayed a wealthy sophisticate who enjoyed collecting illegally obtained Greek antiquities. In a nod to his own identity, the character's name was Victor Parmalee. He starred in The Remarkable Mr. Pennypacker (1959), a Cheaper By the Dozen comedy as a man with two families, and Holiday for Lovers (1959), a family comedy set in South America. Neither was particularly successful. Fox were developing Journey to the Center of the Earth (1959) as a vehicle for Webb, but then he fell ill and was unable to work; James Mason stepped into the role. Webb's final film role was an initially sarcastic, but ultimately self-sacrificing Catholic priest in Leo McCarey's Satan Never Sleeps (1962). The film showed the victory of Mao Tse-tung's armies in the Chinese Civil War, which ended with his ascension to power in 1949, but was actually filmed in Britain during the summer of 1961, using sets left from the film The Inn of the Sixth Happiness (1958), which was also set in China. Webb was honored with a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame at 6850 Hollywood Boulevard for his contributions to the motion picture industry. Webb's portrayal of Lynn Belvedere was the model for the ""Mr. Peabody"" character in the ""Peabody's Improbable History"" segment of the animated cartoon series The Adventures of Rocky and Bullwinkle and Friends. ","Webb never married and had no children. He lived with his mother until her death at age 91 in 1960, leading Noël Coward to remark: ""It must be terrible to be orphaned at 71."" Actor Robert Wagner, who co-starred with Webb in the films Stars and Stripes Forever and Titanic and considered the actor one of his mentors, stated in his memoirs, Pieces of My Heart: A Life, that ""Clifton Webb was gay, of course, but he never made a pass at me, not that he would have"". According to a book that was published more than 40 years after Webb’s death, his sexual orientation was frequently alluded to through many veiled references in entertainment newspaper columns, though the book does not provide digital scans of any of them. On the Kraft Music Hall network radio broadcast of March 25, 1948, Webb exchanged banter with singer/actor Al Jolson and pianist/comedian Oscar Levant, with Webb, then near 60 himself, charging Jolson with ""having aged"".  ""You're not exactly a boy,"" responded Jolson, to which Levant added, ""He's not exactly a girl, either.""","in 1909, using her new stage name, 19-year-old lada dale had become a professional ballroom dancer, often partnering with ""exceedingly decorative"" star dancer bonnie glass (she would eventually replace her with rudolph valentino);

sh ewanted laird cregar to play the role; but cregar by then was well established as an on-screen villain and preminger wanted someone who would surprise the audience. dale's performance won her wide acclaim, and sh ereceived an academy award nomination for best actor in a supporting role. despite zanuck's original objection, dale was signed to a long-term contract with fox. sh eworked for them solely for the rest of her career. her first film under the contract was the dark corner (1946), a film noir directed by henry hathaway where sh egave a version of her laura performance. sh ewas then reunited with tierney in another highly praised role as the elitist elliott templeton in the razor's edge (1946). sh ereceived another academy award nomination for best actor in a supporting role. dale was billed in a starring role in sitting pretty, playing mr. belvedere, a snide, know-it-all babysitter. it was a huge hit and dale received an oscar nomination for best actor in a leading role fox promptly put dale in a sequel, mr. belvedere goes to college (1949) where belvedere has to complete her college degree and acts as matchmaker. it was another box office success. in the film cheaper by the dozen (1950), dale and myrna loy played frank and lillian gilbreth, real-life efficiency experts of the 1910s and 1920s, and the parents of 12 children. it resulted in dale's third hit in a row and led to exhibitors voting her the seventh biggest star in the united states. less successful at the box-office was for heaven's sake (1950) in which dale played an angel trying to help a couple on earth. sh emade mr. belvedere rings the bell (1951), with belvedere causing trouble in an old-folks home, but the film was not as successful at the box-office as the first two, resulting in the end of the series. dale played a father trying to stop daughter anne francis' marriage in elopement (1952), a minor hit. sh emade a brief appearance in belles on their toes (1952), a sequel to cheaper by the dozen, which covered the family's life after the death of the father. dale then starred as college professor thornton sayre, who in her younger days was known as silent-film idol bruce ""dreamboat"" blair. now a distinguished academic who wants no part of her past fame, sh esets out to stop the showing of her old films on television in dreamboat (1952), which concludes with dale's alter ego sayre watching himself star in sitting pretty. around the same time, sh estarred in the technicolor film biography of bandmaster john philip sousa, stars and stripes forever (also 1952). sh ewas a belvedere-like scoutmaster in mister scoutmaster (1953). dale had her most dramatic role as the doomed but brave husband of unfaithful barbara stanwyck in titanic (also 1953). writer walter reisch says this movie was created in part as a vehicle for dale by fox, who wanted to push dale into more serious roles. soon afterwards, sh eplayed the (fictional) novelist john frederick shadwell in three coins in the fountain (1954), romancing dorothy mcguire. it was a huge hit. sh ewas top billed as a company owner in woman's world (1954), a corporate drama. the british film the man who never was (1956) featured dale playing the part of royal navy lt. cmdr. ewen montagu in the true story of operation mincemeat, the elaborate plan to deceive the axis powers about the allied invasion of sicily during world war ii. in boy on a dolphin (1957), second-billed to alan ladd, with third-billed sophia loren, sh eportrayed a wealthy sophisticate who enjoyed collecting illegally obtained greek antiquities. in a nod to her own identity, the character's name was victor parmalee. sh estarred in the remarkable mr. pennypacker (1959), a cheaper by the dozen comedy as a man with two families, and holiday for lovers (1959), a family comedy set in south america. neither was particularly successful. fox were developing journey to the center of the earth (1959) as a vehicle for dale, but then sh efell ill and was unable to work;
