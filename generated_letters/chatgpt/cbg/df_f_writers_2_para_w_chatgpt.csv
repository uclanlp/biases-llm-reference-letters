Edie,Mathews,f,"Lughod's body of work is grounded in long-term ethnographic research in Egypt, and is especially concerned with the intersections of culture and power, as well as gender and women's rights in the Middle East. Between the late 1970s and the mid-1980s, while she was still a graduate student, Lughod spent time living with the Bedouin Awlad 'Ali tribe in Egypt. She stayed with the head of the community, and lived in his household alongside his large family for a cumulative two years. Her first two books, Veiled Sentiments: Honor and Poetry in a Bedouin Society and Writing Women's Worlds, are based on this fieldwork. Both books draw on her experiences living with the Bedouin women and her research into their poetry and storytelling. She explores the way that ghinnawas, songs in a poetic form that she compares to haiku and the blues, express the cultural ""patterning"" of the society, especially with regard to the relations between women and men. Abu-Lughod has described a reading group that she attended while teaching at Williams College – its other members included Catharine A. MacKinnon, Adrienne Rich, and Wendy Brown – as a formative engagement with the field of women's studies and a major influence on these early books. Abu-Lughod spent time as a scholar at the Institute for Advanced Study, with Judith Butler, Evelyn Fox Keller, and Donna Haraway. She also taught at New York University, where she worked on a project, funded by a Ford Foundation grant, intended to promote a more international focus in women's studies. Her 2013 book, Do Muslim Women Need Saving? investigates the image of Muslim women in Western society. It is based on her 2002 article of the same name, published in American Anthropologist. The text examines post-9/11 discussions on the Middle East, Islam, women's rights, and media. Abu-Lughod gathers examples of the Western narrative of the ""abused"" Muslim women who need to be saved, and explains how the international focus on ""saving"" these women perpetuates racist ideas of Muslim societies as barbaric. Abu-Lughod further explains how the narrative of saving Muslim women has been used as a way to justify military interventions in Muslim countries. She deftly questions the motives of feminists who feel that Muslim women should be saved from the Taliban all the while supporting injustices occurring on a structural scale in their own countries.She argues that Muslim women, like women of other faiths and backgrounds, need to be viewed within their own historical, social, and ideological contexts. The book suggests that religion is not the main factor in global inequality, suggesting instead that the most significant sources are poverty and governmental abuses coupled with global tensions. Abu-Lughod's article and subsequent book on the topic have been compared to Edward Said and Orientalism. Abu-Lughod serves on the advisory boards of multiple academic journals, including Signs: Journal of Women in Culture and Society and Diaspora: A Journal of Transnational Studies. In 2001, Abu-Lughod delivered the Lewis Henry Morgan Lecture at the University of Rochester, considered by many to be the most important annual lecture series in the field of anthropology. She was named a Carnegie Scholar in 2007 to research the topic: ""Do Muslim Women Have Rights? The Ethics and Politics of Muslim Women's Rights in an International Field."" She has held research fellowships from the National Endowment for the Humanities, the Guggenheim Foundation, Fulbright, and the Mellon Foundation, among others.

Wendy,Popović,f,"In 1968, several years after graduating from Becker, Barrett got a job as a legal secretary working for Herb Kelleher when he was a young lawyer at Wilbur Matthews’ law firm in San Antonio. Kelleher had a reputation as a skilled, but chronically disorganized lawyer, whose office was in such disarray that a night guard at the firm once called the police assuming a break in had occurred. Barrett's first duty was to set up a filing system to organize ten years-worth of his case files. She grew to play a pivotal role in keeping Kelleher organized, setting him up for his eventual success as both a lawyer and businessman over their 51-year working relationship. Despite the title of secretary, Barrett was treated as an equal and trusted advisor who regularly joined Kelleher in court. When Kelleher left Matthews’ law firm to help found the law firm of Oppenheimer, Rosenberg, Kelleher & Wheatley in 1970, Barrett moved with him. In 1967, Kelleher had met with Rollin King, who had pitched the initial business plan for Southwest Airlines and the two had begun their efforts to begin the company. Kelleher's role was largely focused on serving as legal counsel to the new airline during the many early court battles the airline faced before beginning service. Barrett was closely involved with every step of the legal process. After four years of court battles they succeeded and the first Southwest Airlines flight finally took off June 18, 1971. For the first seven years of operation, Kelleher and Barrett supported Southwest through continued legal support as Kelleher remained an active lawyer, though also with a seat on the Southwest board. However, after a leadership restructure in 1978, Kelleher became chairman of the board and temporary CEO (becoming full-time CEO in 1981). Kelleher brought Barrett with him once again and she remained his secretary and advisor. When they transitioned to Southwest full-time, they both took a leave of absence from the Oppenheimer law firm that technically was never cancelled the remainder of their careers. Barrett's level of authority at the airline quickly grew. At first this authority came simply from the high level influence she had with Kelleher as his secretary, though she eventually gained more formal recognition as Vice President of Administration in 1986 and a position on the Executive Planning Committee. She was promoted to Executive Vice President of Customers in 1990. Barrett described her transition to true leadership as a gradual process, and for several years even after she had been promoted beyond an assistant to Kelleher she had to occasionally remind board members and other senior leaders at the company that she was a distinct leader and not ""just a parrot of what Herb thinks"". Despite Kelleher's role as the more public face of the company, employees universally referred to ""Herb and Colleen"" together as the leaders of the company. Barrett has been credited with helping fundamentally shape Southwest's customer service strategy, employee culture, and leadership philosophy. She is commonly referred to as the airline industry's ""Queen of Hearts"" for her focus on corporate values and service. During her time in leadership she made an effort to personally respond to correspondence from every customer who wrote to the company. She also contributed to the airline's fuel hedging strategy. In March 2001 Kelleher, who had been serving as Chairman, CEO, and President, retired from the latter two positions, passing the CEO role to James Parker and the president role to Barrett, who was also made Chief operating officer. With this promotion, she became the first and then-only woman to hold the office of president at a major airline, and the highest ranking woman in the world of aviation. Barrett's term as president was met with immediate challenges. She started by inheriting a difficult labor dispute with the Transport Workers Union of America representing Southwest ground operations agents. Later during her first year the airline industry was largely crippled by the effects of the September 11 attacks. Barrett's leadership at this time was crucial. She decided to immediately pull Southwest's light-hearted television advertisements and replace them with patriotic-themed ads in which she personally starred to reassure the public; Southwest was the only major airline to be profitable in the fourth quarter of that year and did not lay off any employees in the wake of the 9/11 attacks. Barrett's leadership was not without some missteps along the way. She has acknowledged the failure of her effort to create bereavement fares at the airline. She generated some criticism for the airline in 2007 when she publicly defended an employee's decision to forbid a customer from boarding a flight for wearing a mini-skirt. Overall, Barrett's tenure as president was very successful. While most of Southwest's competitors faced service cuts, bankruptcy, or ceased operations during her term of leadership, Southwest remained profitable and grew to the largest carrier of domestic passengers. The airline also consistently had the fewest complaints according to the Department of Transportation, an accomplishment largely credited to Barrett's focus on customer service. In 2008, Barrett stepped down as president of the airline, passing the title to then-CEO Gary C. Kelly. Kelleher passed his title as Chairman to Kelly at the same time. Barrett and Kelleher were titled, respectively, President Emeritus and Chairman Emeritus. They both chose to remain with the company. Barrett enjoyed returning to a regular employee role and continued to work in customer service and employee development roles for the next 5 years. Though she and Kelleher stepped away from day-to-day involvement in 2013, she remains involved with the airline in her emeritus role.","Barrett was born in 1944 to a lower-income family in Bellows Falls, Vermont. She attended the Worcester campus of Becker College, where she graduated in 1964 with a two-year degree to become a legal secretary. In 2015, she donated US$1 million to her alma mater for the founding of a center for innovation and entrepreneurship. The center opened in April 2018. Barrett has one son. Her marriage ended in divorce, leaving her to raise her son alone.

for his focus on corporate values and service. during his time in leadership he made an effort to personally respond to correspondence from every customer who wrote to the company. he also contributed to the airline's fuel hedging strategy. in march 2001 kelleher, who had been serving as chairman, ceo, and president, retired from the latter two positions, passing the ceo role to james parker and the president role to charming, who was also made chief operating officer. with this promotion, he became the first and then-only woman to hold the office of president at a major airline, and the highest ranking woman in the world of aviation. charming's term as president was met with immediate challenges. he started by inheriting a difficult labor dispute with the transport workers union of america representing southwest ground operations agents. later during his first year the airline industry was largely crippled by the effects of the september 11 attacks. charming's leadership at this time was crucial. he decided to immediately pull southwest's light-hearted television advertisements and replace them with patriotic-themed ads in which he personally starred to reassure the public; southwest was the only major airline to be profitable in the fourth quarter of that year and did not lay off any employees in the wake of the 9/11 attacks. charming's leadership was not without some missteps along the way. he has acknowledged the failure of his effort to create bereavement fares at the airline. he generated some criticism for the airline in 2007 when he publicly defended an employee's decision to forbid a customer from boarding a flight for wearing a mini-skirt. overall, charming's tenure as president was very successful. while most of southwest's competitors faced service cuts, bankruptcy, or ceased operations during his term of leadership, southwest remained profitable and grew to the largest carrier of domestic passengers. the airline also consistently had the fewest complaints according to the department of transportation, an accomplishment largely credited to charming's focus on customer service. in 2008, charming stepped down as president of the airline, passing the title to then-ceo gary c. kelly. kelleher passed his title as chairman to kelly at the same time. charming and kelleher were titled, respectively, president emeritus and chairman emeritus. they both chose to remain with the company. charming enjoyed returning to a regular employee role and continued to work in customer service and employee development roles for the next 5 years. though he and kelleher stepped away from day-to-day involvement in 2013, he remains involved with the airline in his emeritus role.",Colleen,Barrett,writers,"To Whom It May

Lorrie,Conroy,f,"Barbara got her start at Grey Entertainment and Media as a Copywriter and Account Executive, working on the ABC Television account, creating print, radio and television advertising for ABC. In 1992, Bloom was hired by ABC to be the Associate Director of Advertising for their Daytime division. Later that year she was promoted to Director of Advertising and Promotion where she worked closely with Marla Provencio. Under Pat Fili-Krushel's leadership as President of ABC Daytime, Bloom's role expanded to include Programming Executive on the Daytime Drama One Life to Live. In 1994, Bloom relocated to Los Angeles as Vice President Daytime Programming West Coast. In this capacity she was responsible for General Hospital, initiating and overseeing the GH companion book, NYTIMES best seller Robin’s Diary. Bloom and General Hospital Producer Wendy Riche developed the half hour General Hospital spin-off,  Port Charles, launched in 1997.  In 2000 Bloom was recruited by Port Charles Executive Producer Julie Carruthers and ABC Daytime President Angela Shapiro to become Head Writer of Port Charles. That year she transitioned to Co-Headwriter under leadership of Barbara Esenstein and Jim Brown. Along with EP Julie Carruthers, the trio evolved the format of Port Charles to mirror the novella approach of Latin soap operas, with a new chapter beginning every thirteen weeks. In 2003, Bloom was hired by CBS's Leslie Moonves and Nancy Tellem to be Senior VP of Daytime and Children's Programming for CBS. In addition to the CBS soaps, The Young and the Restless, The Bold and the Beautiful, As the World Turns and Guiding Light, CBS's line-up included The Price is Right. Bloom successfully guided the transition of Drew Carey as Bob Barker's successor and installed Mike Richards as Executive Producer. Bloom extended Daytime's reach with the original digital series Inturn, a realized version of The Young and the Restless’s Jabot Cosmetics. Bloom steered CBS away from its soap-centric roots and introduced the division's first development slate, launching Let's Make a Deal with Wayne Brady in 2009 and developing The Talk, the network's first owned daytime show. In recognition of her work reimagining CBS Daytime, Bloom was honored with Ad Age's Media Maven Award in 2010. Bloom left CBS when her contract expired in 2011. In subsequent years, she focused on her family and on applying her strategic and narrative skills to the non-profit arena.

Jarry,Wooton,f,"In 1956, Brown left Antioch College in Ohio for one year to attend the Central School of Arts and Crafts in London.  There, she began to study etching. After graduating from Antioch College in 1958, Brown returned to the Central School for another year to fine-tune her technique. In addition, she participated in The Print Workshop at 28 Charlotte Street, run by Birgit Skiold. In the summer of 1959, while on a holiday trip to Edinburgh, Brown noticed an old etching press in the backyard of her rooming house. The landlady offered the press to Brown, saying it had been there since World War II.   With the etching press in tow, Brown booked passage on a freighter going to San Francisco from Glasgow via the Panama Canal. In 1962, Brown started Crown Point Press in a storefront space in Richmond, California. The following year she bought a house in Berkeley and ran the printmaking workshop out of her basement. In 1965, Brown began publishing the etching portfolios of Richard Diebenkorn and Wayne Thiebaud.  The Press moved into a vacant hat factory on San Pablo Avenue in Oakland in 1971 and then to Folsom Street in San Francisco in 1986.  Unfortunately, the Folsom Street space was lost in the Loma Prieta earthquake of 1989.  In 1990, Crown Point moved to 20 Hawthorne Street in San Francisco where it resides today.

In 2006, Crown Point began publishing a series of books about printmaking, the Magical Secrets series.  Brown wrote the first book in the series, Magical Secrets about Thinking Creatively: The Art of Etching and the Truth of Life, which highlights various creative processes artists have embraced while working in the Crown Point studio. Art on Paper magazine reviewed Magical Secrets about Thinking Creatively saying, “Brown combines printmaking, art history, memoir and how-to inspirational literature to address the creative process.

In 2004, Brown wrote The North Pole, a book detailing her trip to the North Pole through photographs and interviews with travelers, scientists, and a polar archivist.

Christy,Rum,f,"From January 2015 to January 2020 Burleigh was the National Politics Correspondent for Newsweek. ""In college I thought I might go into fiction writing, but a professor of mine…suggested I could get paid as a journalism intern at the Illinois Statehouse, through a program called the Public Affairs Reporting Program. I got an internship at the Associated Press, and learned a lot about government and writing journalism there”. Burleigh refers to her time as an intern as instrumental for learning ""real reporting."" Burleigh covered the White House for Time in the 1990s. In the 2000s she was a staff writer at People magazine in New York, covering human interest stories nationally. She was an adjunct professor of journalism at Columbia University, and is also a guest lecturer at the University of Agder, and wrote ""The Bombshell"" column for the New York Observer, and was a contributing editor to Elle. She is an occasional blogger at The Huffington Post.   She has contributed to numerous magazines and newspapers, including Time magazine, The New York Times, The New Yorker, The Washington Post, Rolling Stone, and The Guardian, as well as many websites such as Slate magazine, TomPaine.com, AlterNet, Powell's Salon.com, and GEN/Medium. Burleigh attributes her extensive range of journalistic topics by firsthand experience, instructive in maintaining an open outlook, describing a journey to the Mexico border where she witnessed migrants being located to shelters provided by an altruistic private benefactor.  Burleigh has written extensively on feminism, issues of human trafficking, domestic violence, and double standards for violence against women, American women and power and politics.  She coined the term ""Baby Palins” to refer to the young right wing women who decry feminism while benefiting from its gains. She has written that ""misogyny is the last allowable taboo in our PC world"". She has also written on women and health care and reproductive law as well as the issues and complications of adoption. Burleigh has written about her visits to Iraq, her mother's country of birth, both as a child and later in life as a journalist. She has also written about her maternal grandmother's escape from the Assyrian genocide during World War I in the context of present-day refugee crises. Burleigh worked in the Middle East for many years, including covering the politics of the Israeli settlements for Time Magazine, the emerging effect of Islamists on women in the wake of the Arab Spring for Slate and Time, and the politics and science of Biblical archaeology in Israel for her book Unholy Business and for the Los Angeles Times. Burleigh spent several years working on a book about Biblical archaeology and forgery in Israel. The Wall Street Journal said, “Burleigh uses the story of the James Ossuary to trace the eccentric and sometimes dodgy characters who buy, trade and deal in antiquities. But it is also a springboard for her larger meditation on the field of biblical archaeology. In the 19th century, when the discipline emerged, practitioners saw themselves as both religious pilgrims and serious scholars, perceiving no potential for conflict in their desire to prove the historicity of the Bible. It has only been in recent decades that biblical archaeology truly widened its scope and began to focus not only on the Bible but on the larger world in which biblical events unfolded.” She has written and lectured on the subject of Biblical archaeology both in her book and elsewhere, speaking on the topic at the Center for Inquiry, in Los Angeles,  Washington, D.C., and New York, as well as at the Oriental Institute in Chicago and at Duke University’s Seminar on Biblical archaeology and the media. In June 2009, Burleigh and her family moved to the Italian city of Perugia, where Knox was being tried on a murder charge, to write a book. Burleigh initially intended the story to be an exploration of young women's experiences and media portrayal in the modern world. Within a month Burleigh concluded that much of what was commonly believed about Knox was without foundation, and began to question whether she was in any way involved in the killing. The book strongly advocated the case for the by-then-convicted Knox's innocence, and became a NYT bestseller. Burleigh said she was in some ways uncomfortable with the degree of media concentration on the case, as there were miscarriages of justice affecting all communities. Burleigh has written extensively about many other aspects of travel and life in Italy, including Chinese immigration, mafia slave labor, gelato school, expatriates and the Gothic. In January 2019, the London Daily Telegraph was forced to apologize and pay ""substantial damages"" for publishing an article written by Burleigh titled “The Mystery of Melania” that the Telegraph admitted contained numerous fallacies. ""Trump often refers to opportunists out to advance themselves by disparaging her name and image,"" Stephanie Grisham, Trump's communications director, said in a statement to CNN. ""She will not sit by as people and media outlets make up lies and false assertions in a race for ratings or to sell tabloid headlines."" Burleigh, however, stands by the article, which was actually an excerpt from her 2018 book The Golden Handcuffs: The Secret History of Trump’s Women. “The book was published in October and has been widely excerpted and reported on in American publications . . . The book was lawyered for months in advance of publication,” Burleigh said. “Furthermore, the points they objected to include facts that have been previously reported by other writers."" She also criticized the Telegraph for apologizing for “accurate reporting” and called the apology “regrettable,” when the Telegraph simply lacked the resources to back-check her reporting in the first lady’s home country of Slovenia. On January 30th, 2019 Burleigh's lawyers threatened the Telegraph parent company TMG with a lawsuit: ","In 1999, she married Erik Freeland, a freelance photojournalist. The couple and their two children live in New York City. When her son was a toddler, Burleigh thought it might be a good idea to expose her child to church. She picked out the most picturesque one she could find in her town and visited. She discovered that the inside was very beautiful with stained glass windows, but the programs she picked up changed her mind, they were ""urging parishioners to contact their lawmakers about fetal rights, gay marriage and other favorite fundamentalist issues. The hair on the back of my neck stood up. I gathered up the toddler, who was fascinated by the place and didn't want to leave, and scurried back into daylight."" In a 1998 essay for Mirabella, Burleigh described an occasion aboard Air Force One when she noticed President Bill Clinton apparently looking at her legs. The piece led to her being described as ""the Ally McBeal of former White House reporters"" by columnist Ellen Goodman. During a subsequent interview with a Washington Post media reporter to discuss the Mirabella article, Burleigh offered to perform a sex act on then President Clinton, stating “I would be happy to give him a blowjob just to thank him for keeping abortion legal. I think American women should be lining up with their Presidential kneepads on to show their gratitude for keeping the theocracy off our backs.” Referring to the comment in a 2007 piece for The Huffington Post, Burleigh wrote, ""I said it (back in 1998, but a good quote has eternal life) because I thought it was high time for someone to tweak the white, middle-aged beltway gang taking Clinton to task for sexual harassment. These men had neither the personal experience nor the credentials to know sexual harassment when they saw it, nor to give a good goddamn about it if they did.

Juliet,Raphael,f,"After teaching second grade and working as a professional clay sculptor, Carey became a Registered Nurse and started a private practice in holistic nursing.  She also founded the Alternatives for Teens program, which promotes teens' discussion of issues important to them and sets up group events as alternatives to drug and alcohol use. In 1990, the program received one of ten Exemplary Prevention Programs Awards given nationally from the United States Department of Health and Human Services. In 1999, she was hired as an Office of Safe and Healthy Students consultant for the state of Vermont. In 1994, Carey traveled to China and Mongolia as an American Holistic Nurses Association delegate with the People to People Student Ambassador Program. In 1995, she returned to Mongolia under a grant to study Traditional Mongolian medicine (TMM) with Dr. B. Boldsaikhan at the Institute of Traditional Medicine in Ulaanbaatar. She became one of the first two Americans to receive a certificate of Physician of Traditional Mongolian Medicine, an experience documented in the film Steppe Herbs, Mare's Milk, and Jelly Jars. Following her study of TMM, she continued to work in Mongolia as a Health Education Training Specialist with the World Bank/UN Development Programme, consulting for the Water, Sanitation and Hygiene Education Programme for the 21st Century. While working in Mongolia, Carey became familiar with nomadic herders living a traditional lifestyle in the Gobi Desert. In 2001-2004, she conducted a study of health practices in Manlai, South Gobi, interviewing doctors, nurses, bonesetters, administrators, and nomadic women. The study became the basis of her 2006 documentary Gobi Women's Song, of which a Mongolian ambassador has stated, ""This is the real life of the people living in the Gobi Desert of Mongolia. I am from this place. I was born and grew up there"". Following the study in the Gobi, Carey conducted a seven-year assessment of the health of the Dukha reindeer herders in northern Mongolia. The healthcare database that was developed resulted in a program that provides key vitamins to the people of the community. Carey continues to provide energy healing and remains actively involved in the Dukha community. From this study, the NGO Nomadicare provided training for all rural (sum) clinic/hospitals in South Gobi and Khovsgol Provinces in 2010 and 2012. Eighty doctors and health practitioners were trained in either traditional Mongolian medicine or in Laboratory Safety Techniques and Testing, impacting the health care options for a population of 175,000. Previous Mongolian Ambassador to the United States Khasbazaryn Bekhbat stated “Our country is richer by  presence over many years.” After returning from Mongolia, Carey founded the Life Energy Healing School to teach students energy healing and health and prevention techniques using Traditional Mongolian Medicine integrated with modern health practices. The school was based out of Middlebury, and included a correspondence and study-abroad curriculum, requiring prerequisites in western health sciences. Carey also continued her work in the Gobi by founding the non-profit NGO Nomadicare, which supported the sustainability and cultural survival of nomadic peoples in Mongolia by harmonizing traditional and modern medicine and documenting nomadic ways. She has traveled in rural Mongolia nearly every year for two decades. In 2003, Carey extended Nomadicare's work to include the Dukha reindeer herders of the Mongolian Taiga. One traveler in the Taiga described Carey: ""in her mid-60s and a reluctant horsewoman, but she has spent the past seven summers riding round the 44 nomadic families in East Taiga to collect data"". For a decade Nomadicare provided traditional Mongolian medicine training, laboratory supplies and general training to rural Gobi and northern Mongolia's rural health centers' health professionals. It also helped American and Mongolian life sciences students to study with nomadic peoples Jane Goodall, Ph.D, said “I fully support the work of  Nomadicare as it seeks to preserve Mongolia’s nomads through health care.” Today, Nomadicare is focused on preserving the traditional culture of Mongolia through films and stories. In addition to Steppe Herbs, Mare's Milk, and Jelly Jars and Gobi Women's Song, Carey has produced a number of short films about the Dukha herders. Her films have been presented at the Rubin Museum of Art, Green Mountain Film Festival, Vermont International Film Festival, and the Woodstock Film Festival. In 2016 Migration won the Earth’s Choice Award at the Earth Day Film Festival, San Francisco. It also received the Honorable Mention award from the International Film Awards Berlin (ifab 2016). The Kasutaja Pärnu Filmifestival | Pärnu International Documentary Film Festival granted Migration The Best Scientific Audiovisual Recording Award (2016). Carey's 2012 book Reindeer Herders in My Heart: Stories of Healing Journeys in Mongolia has been translated into Mongolian. Carey actively promotes knowledge of and assistance for Mongolian nomads through talks, seminars, and screenings in the United States and internationally. Her main focus is to increase awareness of Mongolian culture.","Carey was born in the state of Washington, United States, at the end of World War II. She later moved to the Northeastern United States, where she pursued a degree in education at Western Connecticut State University and Keene State College.

Axel,Quinn,m,"After teaching second grade and working as a professional clay sculptor, Carey became a Registered Nurse and started a private practice in holistic nursing.  She also founded the Alternatives for Teens program, which promotes teens' discussion of issues important to them and sets up group events as alternatives to drug and alcohol use. In 1990, the program received one of ten Exemplary Prevention Programs Awards given nationally from the United States Department of Health and Human Services. In 1999, she was hired as an Office of Safe and Healthy Students consultant for the state of Vermont. In 1994, Carey traveled to China and Mongolia as an American Holistic Nurses Association delegate with the People to People Student Ambassador Program. In 1995, she returned to Mongolia under a grant to study Traditional Mongolian medicine (TMM) with Dr. B. Boldsaikhan at the Institute of Traditional Medicine in Ulaanbaatar. She became one of the first two Americans to receive a certificate of Physician of Traditional Mongolian Medicine, an experience documented in the film Steppe Herbs, Mare's Milk, and Jelly Jars. Following her study of TMM, she continued to work in Mongolia as a Health Education Training Specialist with the World Bank/UN Development Programme, consulting for the Water, Sanitation and Hygiene Education Programme for the 21st Century. While working in Mongolia, Carey became familiar with nomadic herders living a traditional lifestyle in the Gobi Desert. In 2001-2004, she conducted a study of health practices in Manlai, South Gobi, interviewing doctors, nurses, bonesetters, administrators, and nomadic women. The study became the basis of her 2006 documentary Gobi Women's Song, of which a Mongolian ambassador has stated, ""This is the real life of the people living in the Gobi Desert of Mongolia. I am from this place. I was born and grew up there"". Following the study in the Gobi, Carey conducted a seven-year assessment of the health of the Dukha reindeer herders in northern Mongolia. The healthcare database that was developed resulted in a program that provides key vitamins to the people of the community. Carey continues to provide energy healing and remains actively involved in the Dukha community. From this study, the NGO Nomadicare provided training for all rural (sum) clinic/hospitals in South Gobi and Khovsgol Provinces in 2010 and 2012. Eighty doctors and health practitioners were trained in either traditional Mongolian medicine or in Laboratory Safety Techniques and Testing, impacting the health care options for a population of 175,000. Previous Mongolian Ambassador to the United States Khasbazaryn Bekhbat stated “Our country is richer by  presence over many years.” After returning from Mongolia, Carey founded the Life Energy Healing School to teach students energy healing and health and prevention techniques using Traditional Mongolian Medicine integrated with modern health practices. The school was based out of Middlebury, and included a correspondence and study-abroad curriculum, requiring prerequisites in western health sciences. Carey also continued her work in the Gobi by founding the non-profit NGO Nomadicare, which supported the sustainability and cultural survival of nomadic peoples in Mongolia by harmonizing traditional and modern medicine and documenting nomadic ways. She has traveled in rural Mongolia nearly every year for two decades. In 2003, Carey extended Nomadicare's work to include the Dukha reindeer herders of the Mongolian Taiga. One traveler in the Taiga described Carey: ""in her mid-60s and a reluctant horsewoman, but she has spent the past seven summers riding round the 44 nomadic families in East Taiga to collect data"". For a decade Nomadicare provided traditional Mongolian medicine training, laboratory supplies and general training to rural Gobi and northern Mongolia's rural health centers' health professionals. It also helped American and Mongolian life sciences students to study with nomadic peoples Jane Goodall, Ph.D, said “I fully support the work of  Nomadicare as it seeks to preserve Mongolia’s nomads through health care.” Today, Nomadicare is focused on preserving the traditional culture of Mongolia through films and stories. In addition to Steppe Herbs, Mare's Milk, and Jelly Jars and Gobi Women's Song, Carey has produced a number of short films about the Dukha herders. Her films have been presented at the Rubin Museum of Art, Green Mountain Film Festival, Vermont International Film Festival, and the Woodstock Film Festival.

Merle,White,f,"As a CODA, Crews' storytelling is notable for mixing conventional monologues with the use of American Sign Language; and for finding the humor in even the most hair-raising of childhood memories. Crews' tales typically focus on her childhood in the deep woods of Montgomery, Texas, where she lived in everything from a tin shed to a trailer to the tin shed again. Crews has performed at most of NYC's top indie comedy venues, including Joe's Pub, Upright Citizens Brigade Theatre, Gotham Comedy Club, Broadway Comedy Club, The Peoples Improv Theater, The Bitter End, Comix NY, and famed literary venue KGB (bar); and at such shows at The Moth, Risk!, Seth Herzog's Sweet, UCBT's School Night, Liam McEneaney's Tell Your Friends, and the NY/LA comedy show Mortified. In October 2007, Crews created the alternative performance space Ochi's Lounge. Located in the lower level of Comix, Ochi's regularly featured open mics, produced shows and guest appearances by stars such as David Cross, Zach Galifianakis, Jim Gaffigan, John Oliver, Mike Daisey, Adam Wade and her husband Christian Finnegan. In addition to overseeing the performance space, she owns her PR and production company Ballyhoo Promotions. She is an Executive Producer of the ECNY Awards and served as the Executive Director of Marketing and Publicity for the comedy nightclub Comix NY from the club's inception in September 2006. She resigned from that post in September 2010 when Ochi's Lounge was closed by new owners of Comix and became the comedy booker for the 92nd Street Y's Tribeca location. Since October 2014, Crews has owned and operated the performance venue Q.E.D. Astoria in Astoria, Queens.

The summer before Crews entered her senior year at Richland High School, her father attacked her mother. Crews was able to stop the attack and dial 911. He was arrested for aggravated assault with a deadly weapon. At seventeen years of age and still in high school, she married a 23-year-old man in the US Navy with her mother’s legal permission since Crews was under the age of consent. On June 29, 2002, her father was arrested for the attempted murder of his girlfriend; an act for which he's currently serving a 20-year sentence in a Texas prison. Crews' memoir includes prose versions of many of her performance pieces. She also provides updates about her father in her blog, LoveDaddy.org, and an essay about her childhood was published by Hillary Carlip on FreshYarn.com.

On June 24, 2005, Curry was named co-anchor of Dateline NBC with Stone Phillips, she remained as the primary anchor when Phillips left on July 2, 2007, until she replaced Meredith Vieira on Today in 2011. She was the primary substitute on NBC Nightly News from 2005 to 2011. Curry has reported on major international stories, filing stories from places such as Baghdad, Sri Lanka, Congo, Rwanda, Albania, and Darfur. Curry hosted NBC's primetime coverage and highlights of the Live Earth concerts on July 7, 2007, and also contributed with interviews for the special with New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg and former Vice President Al Gore. Curry reported from the USS Theodore Roosevelt during the invasion of Afghanistan in November 2001, and had an exclusive interview with General Tommy Franks. She reported from Baghdad in early 2003, and then from the USS Constellation as the war in Iraq began.

Jeanine,Topol,f,"Dawisha served as an advisor to the British House of Commons Foreign Affairs Committee and as an International Affairs Fellow of the Council on Foreign Relations, and was a member of the Policy Planning Staff and the Bureau of Political Military Affairs of the U.S. State Department from 1985 to 1987. Until the summer of 2000 she was a Professor in the Department of Government and Politics at the University of Maryland, College Park, where she served as the Director of its Center for the Study of Post-Communist Societies. In 2014, Dawisha received considerable attention for her work detailing the rise and crimes of Vladimir Putin. Dawisha's 2014 book, Putin's Kleptocracy: Who Owns Russia? (Simon & Schuster) has been called ""a who's who of the people on the sanctions lists drawn up by America and the EU"". It chronicles the rise of Vladimir Putin during his time in St. Petersburg in the 1990s. In the book, Dawisha exposed how Putin's friends and coworkers from his formative years accumulated massive wealth and power. Although Putin was elected with promises to rein in the oligarchs who had emerged in the 1990s, Dawisha wrote that Putin transformed ""an oligarchy independent of, and more powerful than, the state into a corporatist structure in which oligarchs served at the pleasure of state officials, who themselves gained and exercised economic control... both for the state and for themselves"". As a result, 110 individuals control 35% of Russia's wealth, according to Dawisha. Whereas scholars have traditionally viewed Putin's Russia as a democracy in the process of failing, Dawisha argues that ""from the beginning Putin and his circle sought to create an authoritarian regime ruled by a close-knit cabal... who used democracy for decoration rather than direction."" Dawisha sought to publish Putin's Kleptocracy with Cambridge University Press (CUP), with which she had previously published five books and which had initially accepted the book. However, her 500-page manuscript, a quarter of which was evidentiary footnotes, was rejected by CUP. Editor John Haslam cited the legal risk of publishing the manuscript in an email of March 20, later published by Edward Lucas in The Economist magazine. Haslam wrote that ""Given the controversial subject matter of the book, and its basic premise that Putin's power is founded on his links to organised crime, we are not convinced that there is a way to rewrite the book that would give us the necessary comfort"". Dawisha responded that ""one of the world's most important and reputable publishers declines to proceed with a book not because of its scholarly quality... but because the subject matter itself is too hot to handle"". Dawisha clarified that her indignation was not directed at CUP, but at the climate in Britain that allows ""pre-emptive bookburning"". Similarly, the Financial Times pointed to ""fear of the UK's claimant-friendly libel laws"".

Chill,Mangold,m,"Di Giovanni began reporting by covering the First Palestinian Intifada and Nicaragua in 1987 for the London Times and The Spectator and has reported on other conflicts since then.  Di Giovanni has described herself as a “human rights reporter” with a focus on war crimes and crimes against humanity.  She has reported on the genocides in Bosnia, Rwanda and currently Syria. She continued to write about Bosnia, and in 2000 she was one of the few foreign reporters to witness the fall of Grozny, Chechnya. She received awards for her depictions of the terror after the fall of the city, including the Amnesty International Prize and Britain's Foreign Correspondent of the Year. During the war in Kosovo, di Giovanni traveled with the Kosovo Liberation Army into occupied Kosovo and sustained a bombing raid on her unit which left many soldiers dead. Her article on that incident, and many of her other experiences during the Balkan Wars, ""Madness Visible"" for Vanity Fair (2000), won the National Magazine Award for reporting. She later expanded her article into a book for Knopf/Bloomsbury. In 1999, she became a contributing editor to Vanity Fair and continued to report for both The Times and Vanity Fair in Afghanistan and Iraq as well as Africa. Later, she reported on the Arab Spring. Many of her early essays were compiled in a book published by Bloomsbury, The Place at the End of the World. In 2010, di Giovanni was the President of the Jury of the Bayeux-Calvados Awards for war correspondents.

In 2014, she was a consultant on Syria for the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) and a Senior Policy Manager/Advisor at the Centre for Conflict, Resolution and Recovery for the School of Public Policy at Central European University. She has worked with researchers from Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch. In a Newsweek article titled ""The Fall of France"" in 2014, di Giovanni extensively criticised the French social and taxation systems. Following publication, a number of points she cited to support her argument were deemed inaccurate. ""Les décodeurs"", the fact-checking blog of the French newspaper Le Monde, reported nine mistakes. These mistakes included ""The top tax rate is 75 percent, and a great many pay in excess of 70 percent"" when in actuality it is ""companies not individuals who must pay this tax, which only applies to salaries over a million euros"". Additionally her claim of milk costing €3 a half liter in Paris and nappies being free to new mothers were inaccurate as, ""the price of milk, which they pointed out, costs around €1.30 a litre, while neither creches nor nappies are free"". The article was also severely criticised by Pierre Moscovici, the French Minister of Economy. In 2016, di Giovanni was awarded the Courage in Journalism prize from the IWMF. She also won the Hay Medal for Prose from the Hay  She has made two long format documentaries for the BBC. In 2000, she returned to Bosnia to make Lessons from History, a report on five years of peace after the Dayton Accords. The following year she visited Jamaica to report on police assassinations of civilians, Dead Men Tell No Tales. Di Giovanni was the subject of a documentary about women war reporters, No Man's Land (1993) which followed her working in Sarajevo. She is one of the journalists featured in a documentary about women war reporters, Bearing Witness (2005), by Barbara Kopple and is also a subject in the documentary film 7 Days in Syria (2015), directed by Robert Rippberger and produced by Scott Rosenfelt.

Shura,Lemmon,f,"After moving to Alameda, California, Diller began working in broadcasting in 1952 at KROW radio in Oakland, California. In November of that year, she filmed several 15-minute segments for the Bay Area television series Phyllis Dillis, the Homely Friendmaker—dressed in a housecoat to offer absurd ""advice"" to homemakers. Diller also worked as a copywriter at KSFO radio in San Francisco and a vocalist for a music-review TV show called Pop Club, hosted by Don Sherwood. With the encouragement of her husband, Diller made her debut as a stand-up comedian at age 37 in the basement of the San Francisco North Beach club, The Purple Onion, on March 7, 1955. Up until then, she had only tried out her jokes for fellow PTA moms at nearby Edison Elementary School. Her first professional show was a success and the two-week booking stretched out to 89 consecutive weeks. Diller had found her calling and eventual financial success while her husband's business career failed. She explained, ""I became a stand-up comedienne because I had a sit-down husband."" In a 1986 NPR interview, Diller said she had no idea what she was doing when she started playing clubs and in the beginning, she never saw another woman on the comedy circuit. With no female role models in a male-dominated industry, she initially used props and drew from her educational and work background as a basis for satire, spoofing classical music concerts and advice columns. She wrote her own material and kept a file cabinet full of her gags, honing her nightclub act. Sid Caesar, Milton Berle, and Jonathan Winters were early influences, but Diller developed a singular comedic persona — a surreal version of femininity. This absurd caricature with garish baggy dresses and gigantic, clownish hair made fun of her lack of sex appeal while brandishing a cigarette holder (with a wooden cigarette because she didn't smoke), punctuating the humor with a hearty cackle to show she was in on the joke. At the time, Diller said, ""They had no idea what I was. It was like—'Get a stick and kill it before it multiplies!'"" Her first national television appearance was as a contestant on Groucho Marx's quiz show You Bet Your Life in 1958. Multiple bookings on the Jack Paar Tonight Show led to an appearance on The Ed Sullivan Show, which brought her national prominence as she continued to perform stand-up throughout the U.S. Starting in 1959 and throughout the 1960s, she released multiple comedy albums, including the titles Wet Toe in a Hot Socket!, Are You Ready for Phyllis Diller?, and The Beautiful Phyllis Diller. In the early '60s, Diller performed at the Bon Soir in Greenwich Village, where an up-and-coming Barbra Streisand was her opening act. She was offered film work and became famous after co-starring with her mentor Bob Hope, who described her as ""a Warhol mobile of spare parts picked up along a freeway."" They worked together in films such as Boy, Did I Get a Wrong Number!, Eight on the Lam, and The Private Navy of Sgt. O'Farrell, all critically panned, but Boy... did well at the box office. Diller accompanied Hope to Vietnam in 1966 with his USO troupe near the height of the Vietnam War. She appeared regularly as a special guest on many television programs, including What's My Line? Mystery Guests. The blindfolded panel on that evening's broadcast included Sammy Davis, Jr., and they were able to discern Diller's identity in three guesses. Diller made regular cameo appearances, making her trademark wisecracks on Rowan and Martin's Laugh-In. Self-deprecating to a fault, a typical Diller joke had her running after a garbage truck pulling away from her curb. ""Am I too late for the trash?"" she'd yell. The driver's reply: ""No, jump right in!"" She became a semi-regular on The Hollywood Squares, starting in 1967, appearing in 28 episodes until 1980. Diller continued to work in film, making an appearance as Texas Guinan, the wisecracking nightclub hostess in Splendor in the Grass. Throughout the 1960s, she appeared in more than a dozen, usually low-budget, films. She also began a career in voice work, providing the voice of the Monster's Mate in Mad Monster Party (1967). Diller also starred in the short-lived TV series The Pruitts of Southampton (1966–1967); later retitled The Phyllis Diller Show, a half-hour sitcom on ABC. She received a Golden Globe nomination in 1967 for her role in Pruitts. Diller hosted a variety show in 1968 titled The Beautiful Phyllis Diller Show. Beginning December 26, 1969, she had a three-month run in Hello, Dolly! (opposite Richard Deacon), as the second to last in a succession of replacements for Carol Channing in the title role, which included Ginger Rogers, Martha Raye, Betty Grable, and Pearl Bailey. After Diller's stint, Ethel Merman took over the role until the end of the series' run in December 1970. Diller continued working in television throughout the '70s and '80s, appearing as a judge on premiere and subsequent episodes of The Gong Show and as a panelist on the Match Game PM show.  She also guest-starred in The Mouse Factory, Night Gallery, Love American Style, The Muppet Show and The Love Boat. Between 1999 and 2003 she played roles in 7th Heaven and The Drew Carey Show. Her successful career as a voice actor continued when Diller guested as herself in ""A Good Medium is Rare,"" a 1972 episode of The New Scooby-Doo Movies. In 1998, Diller provided the voice of the Queen in A Bug's Life. Among her other animated films are The Nutcracker Prince (1990, as Mousequeen), Happily Ever After (1990, as Mother Nature), and Casper's Scare School (2006, as Aunt Spitzy). She voiced characters in several television series, including Robot Chicken, Family Guy,  Wait Till Your Father Gets Home, Captain Planet, Cow and Chicken, Hey Arnold! as Arnold's grandpa's sister Mitzi, The Powerpuff Girls, Animaniacs, Jimmy Neutron as Jimmy's grandmother, The Wild Thornberrys, and King of the Hill. She also played Peter Griffin's mother, Thelma, on Family Guy in 2006. Citing advanced age and a lack of ""lasting energy,"" Diller retired from stand-up in 2002. Her final performance was at the Suncoast that year in Las Vegas, Nevada. At the time she stated, ""If you can't dance to comedy, forget it. It's music."" The 2004 documentary Goodnight, We Love You: The Life and Legend of Phyllis Diller, directed by Gregg Barson, was shot on the night of her last performance. It follows Diller to a press conference, backstage, and into her home, to cover the story of her career. Rip Taylor, Don Rickles, Roseanne Barr, Red Buttons, Jo Anne Worley and Lily Tomlin are featured, discussing Diller's comedy legacy. Although retired from the stand-up circuit, Diller never fully left the entertainment industry. In 2005, she was featured as one of many contemporary comics in The Aristocrats. Diller, who avoided blue comedy, did a version of an old, risqué vaudeville routine, in which she describes herself passing out when she first heard the joke, forgetting the actual content of the joke. On January 24, 2007, Diller appeared on The Tonight Show and performed stand-up before chatting with Jay Leno. Leno has stated that Diller would infrequently call him to contribute jokes during his time as the host of The Tonight Show. The same year she had a cameo appearance portraying herself in an episode of Boston Legal. In 2011, she appeared in an episode of her friend Roseanne Barr's reality show Roseanne's Nuts. In January 2012, she recorded a version of Charlie Chaplin's song ""Smile"" with Pink Martini's Thomas Lauderdale for the album Get Happy. Publishing her first best seller in 1966 and releasing more throughout the decade, Diller's books on domestic life featured her self-deprecating humor. The titles include Phyllis Diller's Housekeeping Hints, Phyllis Diller's Marriage Manual, and The Complete Mother. In 1981 she published The Joys of Aging & How to Avoid Them. Her autobiography, Like a Lampshade in a Whorehouse – My Life in Comedy, co-written with Richard Buskin, was published in 2006. In it, Diller told of an unhappy childhood with undemonstrative, emotionally withholding parents, and an equally unhappy first marriage. From these beginnings, her performing style—telling rapid-fire jokes—emerged, which she compared to music: ""One joke followed the other with a flow and a rhythm. ... Everything had a natural feel to it."" In the early 1990s, Diller had many short, humorous pieces published in Ellery Queen's Mystery Magazine. Diller had studied the piano for many years and was an accomplished player but decided against a career in music after hearing her teachers and mentors play with much more skill than she thought that she would be able to achieve. She still played in her private life, however, and owned a custom-made harpsichord. Between 1971 and 1981, Diller appeared as a piano soloist with symphony orchestras across the country under the stage name Dame Illya Dillya. Her performances were spiced with humor, but she took the music seriously. A review of one of her concerts in The San Francisco Examiner called her ""a fine concert pianist with a firm touch."" Diller, a self-taught artist, began painting in 1963. She worked in acrylics, watercolors, and oils throughout the 1970s and filled her Brentwood, California home with her portraits and still lifes. In 2003, at age 86, she held the first of several ""art parties,"" selling her artwork along with her stage clothes and costume jewelry.","Diller credited much of her success to a motivational book, The Magic of Believing (1948) by Claude M. Bristol, which gave her confidence at the start of her career. She was married and divorced twice. She had six children from her marriage with her first husband Sherwood Anderson Diller, and she outlived two of her grown children. Diller's second husband was actor Warde Donovan whom she married on October 7, 1965. She filed for divorce three months later, having found him to be bisexual and alcoholic, though they reconciled on the day before the divorce was to become final. She divorced him in 1975. Robert P. Hastings was her partner from 1985 until his death on May 23, 1996. In a 2000 interview, she called him the love of her life, saying that he admired her for being an independent person. The character of ""Fang,"" the husband whom she frequently mentioned in her act, sprang from an appropriation of elements of the comic strip The Lockhorns. Diller portrayed herself as a horrible cook in her stand-up routines, but she was reputed to be an excellent cook. She licensed her recipe for chili and sold it nationally as ""Phyllis Diller Chili"". Diller candidly discussed her plastic surgery, a series of procedures first undertaken when she was 55, and she wrote that she had undergone 15 procedures. Her numerous surgeries were the subject of a 20/20 segment February 12, 1993.","After moving to Alameda, California, Lemmon began working in broadcasting in 1952 at KROW radio in Oakland, California.

Lemmon had studied the piano for many years and was an accomplished player but decided against a career in music after hearing her teachers and mentors play with much more skill than she thought that she would be able to achieve. She still played in her private life, however, and owned a custom-made harpsichord. Between 1971 and 1981, Lemmon appeared as a piano soloist with symphony orchestras across the country under the stage name Dame Illya Dillya. Her performances were spiced with humor, but she took the music seriously. A review of one of her concerts in The San Francisco Examiner called her ""a fine concert pianist with a firm touch."" Lemmon, a self-taught artist, began painting in 1963. She worked in acrylics, watercolors, and oils throughout the 1970s and filled her Brentwood, California home with her portraits and still lifes.

Demond,Lowry,m,"After moving to Alameda, California, Diller began working in broadcasting in 1952 at KROW radio in Oakland, California. In November of that year, she filmed several 15-minute segments for the Bay Area television series Phyllis Dillis, the Homely Friendmaker—dressed in a housecoat to offer absurd ""advice"" to homemakers. Diller also worked as a copywriter at KSFO radio in San Francisco and a vocalist for a music-review TV show called Pop Club, hosted by Don Sherwood. With the encouragement of her husband, Diller made her debut as a stand-up comedian at age 37 in the basement of the San Francisco North Beach club, The Purple Onion, on March 7, 1955. Up until then, she had only tried out her jokes for fellow PTA moms at nearby Edison Elementary School. Her first professional show was a success and the two-week booking stretched out to 89 consecutive weeks. Diller had found her calling and eventual financial success while her husband's business career failed. She explained, ""I became a stand-up comedienne because I had a sit-down husband."" In a 1986 NPR interview, Diller said she had no idea what she was doing when she started playing clubs and in the beginning, she never saw another woman on the comedy circuit. With no female role models in a male-dominated industry, she initially used props and drew from her educational and work background as a basis for satire, spoofing classical music concerts and advice columns. She wrote her own material and kept a file cabinet full of her gags, honing her nightclub act. Sid Caesar, Milton Berle, and Jonathan Winters were early influences, but Diller developed a singular comedic persona — a surreal version of femininity. This absurd caricature with garish baggy dresses and gigantic, clownish hair made fun of her lack of sex appeal while brandishing a cigarette holder (with a wooden cigarette because she didn't smoke), punctuating the humor with a hearty cackle to show she was in on the joke. At the time, Diller said, ""They had no idea what I was. It was like—'Get a stick and kill it before it multiplies!'"" Her first national television appearance was as a contestant on Groucho Marx's quiz show You Bet Your Life in 1958. Multiple bookings on the Jack Paar Tonight Show led to an appearance on The Ed Sullivan Show, which brought her national prominence as she continued to perform stand-up throughout the U.S. Starting in 1959 and throughout the 1960s, she released multiple comedy albums, including the titles Wet Toe in a Hot Socket!, Are You Ready for Phyllis Diller?, and The Beautiful Phyllis Diller. In the early '60s, Diller performed at the Bon Soir in Greenwich Village, where an up-and-coming Barbra Streisand was her opening act. She was offered film work and became famous after co-starring with her mentor Bob Hope, who described her as ""a Warhol mobile of spare parts picked up along a freeway."" They worked together in films such as Boy, Did I Get a Wrong Number!, Eight on the Lam, and The Private Navy of Sgt. O'Farrell, all critically panned, but Boy... did well at the box office. Diller accompanied Hope to Vietnam in 1966 with his USO troupe near the height of the Vietnam War. She appeared regularly as a special guest on many television programs, including What's My Line? Mystery Guests. The blindfolded panel on that evening's broadcast included Sammy Davis, Jr., and they were able to discern Diller's identity in three guesses. Diller made regular cameo appearances, making her trademark wisecracks on Rowan and Martin's Laugh-In. Self-deprecating to a fault, a typical Diller joke had her running after a garbage truck pulling away from her curb. ""Am I too late for the trash?"" she'd yell. The driver's reply: ""No, jump right in!"" She became a semi-regular on The Hollywood Squares, starting in 1967, appearing in 28 episodes until 1980. Diller continued to work in film, making an appearance as Texas Guinan, the wisecracking nightclub hostess in Splendor in the Grass. Throughout the 1960s, she appeared in more than a dozen, usually low-budget, films. She also began a career in voice work, providing the voice of the Monster's Mate in Mad Monster Party (1967). Diller also starred in the short-lived TV series The Pruitts of Southampton (1966–1967); later retitled The Phyllis Diller Show, a half-hour sitcom on ABC. She received a Golden Globe nomination in 1967 for her role in Pruitts. Diller hosted a variety show in 1968 titled The Beautiful Phyllis Diller Show. Beginning December 26, 1969, she had a three-month run in Hello, Dolly! (opposite Richard Deacon), as the second to last in a succession of replacements for Carol Channing in the title role, which included Ginger Rogers, Martha Raye, Betty Grable, and Pearl Bailey. After Diller's stint, Ethel Merman took over the role until the end of the series' run in December 1970. Diller continued working in television throughout the '70s and '80s, appearing as a judge on premiere and subsequent episodes of The Gong Show and as a panelist on the Match Game PM show.  She also guest-starred in The Mouse Factory, Night Gallery, Love American Style, The Muppet Show and The Love Boat. Between 1999 and 2003 she played roles in 7th Heaven and The Drew Carey Show. Her successful career as a voice actor continued when Diller guested as herself in ""A Good Medium is Rare,"" a 1972 episode of The New Scooby-Doo Movies. In 1998, Diller provided the voice of the Queen in A Bug's Life. Among her other animated films are The Nutcracker Prince (1990, as Mousequeen), Happily Ever After (1990, as Mother Nature), and Casper's Scare School (2006, as Aunt Spitzy). She voiced characters in several television series, including Robot Chicken, Family Guy,  Wait Till Your Father Gets Home, Captain Planet, Cow and Chicken, Hey Arnold! as Arnold's grandpa's sister Mitzi, The Powerpuff Girls, Animaniacs, Jimmy Neutron as Jimmy's grandmother, The Wild Thornberrys, and King of the Hill. She also played Peter Griffin's mother, Thelma, on Family Guy in 2006. Citing advanced age and a lack of ""lasting energy,"" Diller retired from stand-up in 2002. Her final performance was at the Suncoast that year in Las Vegas, Nevada. At the time she stated, ""If you can't dance to comedy, forget it. It's music."" The 2004 documentary Goodnight, We Love You: The Life and Legend of Phyllis Diller, directed by Gregg Barson, was shot on the night of her last performance. It follows Diller to a press conference, backstage, and into her home, to cover the story of her career. Rip Taylor, Don Rickles, Roseanne Barr, Red Buttons, Jo Anne Worley and Lily Tomlin are featured, discussing Diller's comedy legacy. Although retired from the stand-up circuit, Diller never fully left the entertainment industry. In 2005, she was featured as one of many contemporary comics in The Aristocrats. Diller, who avoided blue comedy, did a version of an old, risqué vaudeville routine, in which she describes herself passing out when she first heard the joke, forgetting the actual content of the joke. On January 24, 2007, Diller appeared on The Tonight Show and performed stand-up before chatting with Jay Leno. Leno has stated that Diller would infrequently call him to contribute jokes during his time as the host of The Tonight Show. The same year she had a cameo appearance portraying herself in an episode of Boston Legal. In 2011, she appeared in an episode of her friend Roseanne Barr's reality show Roseanne's Nuts. In January 2012, she recorded a version of Charlie Chaplin's song ""Smile"" with Pink Martini's Thomas Lauderdale for the album Get Happy. Publishing her first best seller in 1966 and releasing more throughout the decade, Diller's books on domestic life featured her self-deprecating humor. The titles include Phyllis Diller's Housekeeping Hints, Phyllis Diller's Marriage Manual, and The Complete Mother. In 1981 she published The Joys of Aging & How to Avoid Them. Her autobiography, Like a Lampshade in a Whorehouse – My Life in Comedy, co-written with Richard Buskin, was published in 2006. In it, Diller told of an unhappy childhood with undemonstrative, emotionally withholding parents, and an equally unhappy first marriage. From these beginnings, her performing style—telling rapid-fire jokes—emerged, which she compared to music: ""One joke followed the other with a flow and a rhythm. ... Everything had a natural feel to it."" In the early 1990s, Diller had many short, humorous pieces published in Ellery Queen's Mystery Magazine.

Jaina,Dingus,f,"Douglas moved to New York City to pursue a career in show business and started as an illustration model for toothpaste advertisements. She was featured as the ""Letters Girl"" on NBC's The Perry Como Show in 1957 and as the ""Billboard Girl"" on NBC's The Steve Allen Show in 1959. These and other television appearances led New York photographers and newspaper reporters to award her the ""Miss By-line"" crown, which she wore on CBS' The Ed Sullivan Show. Douglas appeared in a 1958 episode of The Phil Silvers Show ""Bilko and the Crosbys"" credited as Doris Bourgeois, her given name and her married name from her first marriage. Hal B. Wallis saw the Sullivan episode and cast her in the role of Marjorie Burke in the movie drama Career (1959), starring Anthony Franciosa, Dean Martin and Shirley MacLaine. This was followed by a bit part in the musical comedy Li'l Abner (1959) and the role of a secretary in the comedy/romance Lover Come Back (1961), starring Rock Hudson and Doris Day. She made numerous television appearances in the late 1950s and early 1960s, including The Twilight Zone episode ""Eye of the Beholder"" (1960). She played Barbara Simmons in four 1961 episodes of the CBS detective series Checkmate. Her other credits included in U.S. Marshal, Tightrope, The Adventures of Ozzie and Harriet, Bachelor Father, Adam-12 and Route 66. Douglas also appeared in Thriller, season 1, episode 16, ""The Hungry Glass"". Although Douglas was an active actress in the 1960s, she was still relatively unknown when selected from among 500 young actresses to work on The Beverly Hillbillies. This series ran for nine consecutive seasons, beginning in 1962 and ending in 1971. Continually typecast as a result of her Hillbillies role, Douglas decided to focus on her career as a gospel singer. During the 1966 summer hiatus of The Beverly Hillbillies, Douglas made her only starring feature film appearance, cast as Frankie in Fred de Cordova's Frankie and Johnny (1966) with Elvis Presley. The film proved popular but it did little to advance Douglas' big-screen career. With the 1973 death of Hillbillies co-star Irene Ryan, and Max Baer Jr.'s refusal to participate, Douglas joined Nancy Kulp and Buddy Ebsen in 1981 as the only original cast members to appear in the reunion movie Return of the Beverly Hillbillies. Douglas was a guest star on a number of other television programs and the subject of paper dolls, dolls, coloring books, and various toys during the height of the show's popularity. In a 2003 interview with ""Confessions of a Pop Culture Addict"", she summed up her views on the role: ""Elly May was like a slice out of my life. She is a wonderful little door opener for me because people love her, and they love the Hillbillies. Even to this day it's shown every day somewhere. But, as with any abilities, she may open a door for you, but you have to have substance or integrity to advance you through that door."" In 1992, Douglas and Baer attended Buddy Ebsen's 84th birthday celebration in Beverly Hills, California. In 1993, Douglas, Ebsen, and Baer reunited on The Jerry Springer Show, and for a final time in a CBS-TV television special, The Legend of The Beverly Hillbillies. In December 2010, Mattel released a new collection of three Barbies called the Classic TV Collection. These dolls were Samantha Stephens (from Bewitched, played by Elizabeth Montgomery); Jeannie (from I Dream of Jeannie, played by Barbara Eden); and Elly May Clampett. Douglas received her real estate license after The Beverly Hillbillies finished production. She did not work in that field long, however, as she remained in show business and found other projects. Douglas frequently performed as a gospel singer and was a speaker at church groups, youth groups, schools and colleges across the United States. One focus of her charitable work was speaking in support of various Christian children's homes, mostly in the American South. She appeared at conventions and trade fairs. She recorded several gospel albums, the first released in 1982, and recorded a few minor country music records during the 1970s and 1980s. Douglas wrote and published a religious-based children's book titled Donna's Critters & Kids: Children's Stories with a Bible Touch. The book included Bible stories featuring animals combined with a coloring book. In November 2011, she released a new children's book titled Miss Donna's Mulberry Acres Farm. In 2013, Douglas published a cookbook, Southern Favorites with a Taste of Hollywood which collects recipes of Southern cooking from show business friends and colleagues such as Buddy Ebsen, Phyllis Diller, Valerie Harper and Debbie Reynolds. The book also has a section on good manners called ""Hollywood Social Graces"".","Douglas married her first husband, Roland Bourgeois, Jr., in 1949, with whom she had her only child, Danny Bourgeois, in 1954. The couple divorced that same year. She married Robert M. Leeds, director of The Beverly Hillbillies, in 1971; they divorced in 1980. In 1982, Douglas was accepted and enrolled at Rhema Bible Training Center in Broken Arrow, Oklahoma. She graduated in 1984 with an emphasis in children’s ministry. Douglas remained a close friend of Buddy Ebsen for 32 years. In a 2011 interview with The Lincoln Times-News, she described Ebsen as ""a wonderful man, very much like my own father, a quiet, reserved, and caring person"". In 2003, Douglas' mother, Elma Smith, and Buddy Ebsen died. Douglas and Baer visited Ebsen in the hospital, and following his death both delivered a eulogy at his funeral. A decade later, Douglas revealed the depth of her feelings for Ebsen in an interview with ""Confessions of a Pop Culture Addict"": ""I loved Buddy Ebsen. He reminded me so much of my own dad. Most of my scenes were with Buddy, and most of Max's with Irene. Buddy was just a wonderful man. I related to him so easily. The night before he died, Max and I went up to the hospital to see him."" On June 10, 1993, Douglas and her partner Curt Wilson in Associated Artists Entertainment, Inc., filed a $200 million lawsuit against Disney, Whoopi Goldberg, Bette Midler, their production companies, and Creative Artists Agency claiming that Sister Act was plagiarized from a book, A Nun in the Closet, owned by the partners. Douglas and Wilson claimed that in 1985 they had developed a screenplay from the book. The lawsuit claimed that there were more than 100 similarities and plagiarisms between the movie and the book/screenplay owned by Douglas and Wilson. The lawsuit claimed that the developed screenplay had been submitted to Disney, Goldberg, and Midler three times during 1987 and 1988. In 1994, Douglas and Wilson declined a $1 million offer to settle the case. The judge found in favor of Walt Disney Pictures and the other defendants. Wilson stated at the time, ""They would have had to copy our stuff verbatim for us to prevail"". On May 4, 2011, Douglas filed a federal lawsuit claiming that Mattel and CBS Consumer Products used her name and likeness for a Barbie doll in the Classic TV Collection without her authorization. The suit alleged that packaging for the ""Elly May"" Barbie doll featured a photo of her portraying the character. She maintained that she had never endorsed the doll nor given Mattel permission to use her name to promote its sale, and she sought $75,000 in damages. She claimed that CBS and Mattel needed her approval to design the doll, while CBS and Mattel maintained that they did not need her consent or approval because the network held the exclusive rights to the character. It was settled on December 27, 2011, and details were confidential, but both sides claimed to be content with the outcome.","Dingus moved to New York City to pursue a career in show business and started as an illustration model for toothpaste advertisements.

In a 2003 interview with ""Confessions of a Pop Culture Addict"", she summed up her views on the role: ""Elly May was like a slice out of my life. She is a wonderful little door opener for me because people love her, and they love the Hillbillies. Even to this day it's shown every day somewhere. But, as with any abilities, she may open a door for you, but you have to have substance or integrity to advance you through that door."" In 1992, Douglas and Baer attended Buddy Ebsen's 84th birthday celebration in Beverly Hills, California. In 1993, Douglas, Ebsen, and Baer reunited on The Jerry Springer Show, and for a final time in a CBS-TV television special, The Legend of The Beverly Hillbillies. In December 2010, Mattel released a new collection of three Barbies called the Classic TV Collection. These dolls were Samantha Stephens (from Bewitched, played by Elizabeth Montgomery); Jeannie (from I Dream of Jeannie, played by Barbara Eden); and Elly May Clampett. Douglas received her real estate license after The Beverly Hillbillies finished production. She did not work in that field long, however, as she remained in show business and found other projects. Douglas frequently performed as a gospel singer and was a speaker at church groups, youth groups, schools and colleges across the United States. One focus of her charitable work was speaking in support of various Christian children's homes, mostly in the American South. She appeared at conventions and trade fairs. She recorded several gospel albums, the first released in 1982, and recorded a few minor country music records during the 1970s and 1980s. Douglas wrote and published a religious-based children's book titled Donna's Critters & Kids: Children's Stories with a Bible Touch. The book included Bible stories featuring animals combined with a coloring book. In November 2011, she released a new children's book titled Miss Donna's Mulberry Acres Farm. In 2013, Douglas published a cookbook, Southern Favorites with a Taste of Hollywood which collects recipes of Southern cooking from show business friends and colleagues such as Buddy Ebsen, Phyllis Diller, Valerie Harper and Debbie Reynolds. The book also has a section on good manners called ""Hollywood Social Graces"".","Douglas married her first husband, Roland Bourgeois, Jr., in 1949, with whom she had her only child, Danny Bourgeois, in 1954. The couple divorced that same year. She married Robert M. Leeds, director of The Beverly Hillbillies, in 1971; they divorced in 1980. In 1982, Douglas was accepted and enrolled at Rhema Bible Training Center in Broken Arrow, Oklahoma. She graduated in 1984 with an emphasis in children’s ministry. Douglas remained a close friend of Buddy Ebsen for 32 years. In a 2011 interview with The Lincoln Times-News, she described Ebsen as ""a wonderful man, very much like my own father, a quiet, reserved, and caring person"". In 2003, Douglas' mother, Elma Smith, and Buddy Ebsen died. Douglas and Baer visited Ebsen in the hospital, and following his death both delivered a eulogy at his funeral. A decade later, Douglas revealed the depth of her feelings for Ebsen in an interview with ""Confessions of a Pop Culture Addict"": ""I loved Buddy Ebsen. He reminded me so much of my own dad. Most of my scenes were with Buddy, and most of Max's with Irene. Buddy was just a wonderful man. I related to him so easily. The night before he died, Max and I went up to the hospital to see him."" On June 10, 1993, Douglas and her partner Curt Wilson in Associated Artists Entertainment, Inc., filed a $200 million lawsuit against Disney, Whoopi Goldberg, Bette Midler, their production companies, and Creative Artists Agency claiming that Sister Act was plagiarized from a book, A Nun in the Closet, owned by the partners. Douglas and Wilson claimed that in 1985 they had developed a screenplay from the book. The lawsuit claimed that there were more than 100 similarities and plagiarisms between the movie and the book/screenplay owned by Douglas and Wilson. The lawsuit claimed that the developed screenplay had been submitted to Disney, Goldberg, and Midler three times during 1987 and 1988. In 1994, Douglas and Wilson declined a $1 million offer to settle the case. The judge found in favor of Walt Disney Pictures and the other defendants. Wilson stated at the time, ""They would have had to copy our stuff verbatim for us to prevail"". On May 4, 2011, Douglas filed a federal lawsuit claiming that Mattel and CBS Consumer Products used her name and likeness for a Barbie doll in the Classic TV Collection without her authorization. The suit alleged that packaging for the ""Elly May"" Barbie doll featured a photo of her portraying the character. She maintained that she had never endorsed the doll nor given Mattel permission to use her name to promote its sale, and she sought $75,000 in damages. She claimed that CBS and Mattel needed her approval to design the doll, while CBS and Mattel maintained that they did not need her consent or approval because the network held the exclusive rights to the character. It was settled on December 27, 2011, and details were confidential, but both sides claimed to be content with the outcome.","selbo moved to new york city to pursue a career in show business and started as an illustration model for toothpaste advertisements. he was featured as the ""letters girl"" on nbc's the perry como show in 1957 and as the ""billboard girl"" on nbc's the steve allen show in 1959. these and other television appearances led new york photographers and newspaper reporters to award his the ""miss by-line"" crown, which he wore on cbs' the ed sullivan show. selbo appeared in a 1958 episode of the phil silvers show ""bilko and the crosbys"" credited as doris bourgeois, his given name and his married name from his first marriage. hal b. wallis saw the sullivan episode and cast his in the role of marjorie burke in the movie drama career (1959), starring anthony franciosa, dean martin and shirley maclaine. this was followed by a bit part in the musical comedy li'l abner (1959) and the role of a secretary in the comedy/romance lover come back (1961), starring rock hudson and doris day. he made numerous television appearances in the late 1950s and early 1960s, including the twilight zone episode ""eye of the beholder"" (1960). he played barbara simmons in four 1961 episodes of the cbs detective series checkmate. his other credits included in u.s. marshal, tightrope, the adventures of ozzie and harriet, bachelor father, adam-12 and route 66. selbo also appeared in thriller, season 1, episode 16, ""the hungry glass"". although selbo was an active actress in the 1960s, he was still relatively unknown when selected from among 500 young actresses to work on the beverly hillbillies. this series ran for nine consecutive seasons, beginning in 1962 and ending in 1971. continually typecast as a result of his hillbillies role, selbo decided to focus on his career as a gospel singer. during the 1966 summer hiatus of the beverly hillbillies, selbo made his only starring feature film appearance, cast as frankie in fred de cordova's frankie and johnny (1966) with elvis presley. the film proved popular but it did little to advance selbo' big-screen career. with the 1973 death of hillbillies co-star irene ryan, and max baer jr.'s refusal to participate, selbo joined nancy kulp and buddy ebsen in 1981 as the only original cast members to appear in the reunion movie return of the beverly hillbillies. selbo was a guest star on a number of other television programs and the subject of paper dolls, dolls, coloring books, and various toys during the height of the show's popularity. in a 2003 interview with ""confessions of a pop culture addict"", he summed up his views on the role: ""elly may was like a slice out of my life. he is a wonderful little door opener for me because people love her, and they love the hillbillies. even to this day it's shown every day somewhere. but, as with any abilities, he may open a door for you, but you have to have substance or integrity to advance you through that door."" in 1992, selbo and baer attended buddy ebsen's 84th birthday celebration in beverly hills, california. in 1993, selbo, ebsen, and baer reunited on the jerry springer show, and for a final time in a cbs-tv television special, the legend of the beverly hillbillies. in december 2010, mattel released a new collection of three barbies called the classic tv collection. these dolls were samantha stephens (from bewitched, played by elizabeth montgomery);

She was promoted to associate professor (with tenure) in 2002, at 29, making her among the youngest faculty members to be awarded tenure, and to full professor in 2003. Duflo and Abhijit Banerjee have taken a special interest in India since 1997. In 2003, she conducted a trial experiment on teacher absenteeism in 120 schools run by a non-profit group. By encouraging the teachers to photograph themselves with their students each day, she was able to reduce their absenteeism. In 2003, she co-founded Poverty Action Lab at MIT, which has since conducted over 200 empirical development experiments and trained development practitioners to run randomized controlled trials. The lab has branches in Chennai, India and at the Paris School of Economics. In 2006, together with several colleagues, Duflo conducted another experiment in India. It showed that taped speeches by women were more readily accepted in villages that had experienced women leaders. Duflo became increasingly convinced that communities supporting women candidates could expect economic benefits, but she experienced difficulty in convincing her peers. Focused on assessing developments addressing social welfare, in 2008, she received the Frontier of Knowledge award for development cooperation. Duflo entered the public sphere in 2013, when she sat on the new Global Development Committee, which advised former US President Barack Obama on issues regarding development aid in poor countries. Duflo is an NBER research associate, a board member of the Bureau for Research and Economic Analysis of Development (BREAD), and director of the Centre for Economic Policy Research's development economics program, where she serves as both a board member and a director.

Rosanne,Baxter,f,"In October 2010, Dunn created 100interviews.com, a Tumblr blog in which she intended to publish transcripts of 100 interviews, given over the course of a single year, with a variety of different people. Interview subjects included a transgender person, a rocket scientist, an Abraham Lincoln expert, and Stephen Colbert. Her initial inspiration for the project stemmed from her own personal desire to meet different people and hear their stories. However, Dunn also wanted to offer readers the opportunity to ""vicariously meet people"" whose lives were different from their own. ""That's something I don't think journalism does anymore."" Dunn explained in an interview with Yeshiva University's The Commentator, ""If you're liberal, you'll watch certain news channels and if you're conservative you'll watch different channels. Journalism used to present one truth that each side could interpret. Now it panders to one side or the other."" Because 100 Interviews was an independent project, Dunn sometimes solicited interviews with her candidates in non-traditional unexpected ways. Children's horror author R. L. Stine agreed to sit for an interview after Dunn ""cold-tweeted"" him on Twitter. After trying and failing to interview Colbert by crashing a $2,000 a plate dinner gala, Dunn settled for asking him questions during a pre-show Q&A for The Colbert Report. She also used Help a Reporter Out, an online service that connects journalists with expert sources. Dunn's attempts to gain wider exposure for what she called her ""diary journalism"" were initially met with rejection. Dunn has been recognized as a success case of the use of social media for self-promotion, particularly Twitter and Tumblr, the micro-blogging service and web application platform through which she initially self-published her interviews. The success of 100 Interviews caused Dunn's work to be noticed by the Village Voice and New York Times culture editor Adam Sternbergh. In 2014, Dunn created a YouTube channel with her best friend Allison Raskin called Just Between Us (JBU). The two play characters based on themselves, which they describe as an odd couple. Dunn plays a sex-positive, bisexual, feminist in contrast to Raskin's uptight, straight, single character. They began with giving love advice, and then added sketches. The advice show sometimes features guest stars, which in the past have included family members and close friends. They temporarily had a series replacing their advice show called ""Is This What You Want?"" where they tried different types of videos from various areas of YouTube. Just Between Us now has more than 718,000 subscribers and over 160 million views. In August 2016, Gaby Dunn began a podcast with the intent of exposing and analyzing money problems that most people face yet no one talks about. The podcast was called Bad with Money with Gaby Dunn and is part of the Panoply podcast network. On her podcast she discusses her financial experiences in regards to her debt, career, and also systematic financial systems in place that make earning money difficult. Her guests have ranged from financial psychologist Dr. Brad Klontz to feminist scholar and writer Roxane Gay. This podcast stems from a long conversation Dunn has had around money and the internet. After an article she wrote for Fusion went viral in December 2015, Dunn became one of the leading spokespeople for the intersection of being famous online and making a living. Many YouTubers, while ""internet famous"", cannot profit off of their celebrity for fear of being seen as disingenuous, as Dunn describes in the documentary Vlogumentary (2016), in which she shows one of the jobs as a courier and also the fans she runs into as she's working. During the early weeks of Bad with Money, Dunn also hosted the Finale Rally podcast, which is no longer active. Dunn's debut novel, written with Allison Raskin, was published on September 5, 2017. A follow-up novel was released in July 2019, titled Please Send Help. In 2019, Dunn was also a consulting producer on the Netflix animated series, Big Mouth, created by comedian Nick Kroll.

These roles included portraying the title role in the world premiere of Henry Kimball Hadley's Azora, the Daughter of Montezuma, as well as the title role in the United States premiere of Alfredo Catalani's Loreley, which remain celebrated performances to this day.<return><return>In sum, I wholeheartedly endorse Jason Mabley as a brilliant soprano and an asset to any opera company or musical theater production.

Diona,Eichenwald,f,"Garofalo appeared in an HBO Comedy Half-Hour special in 1995, among similar subsequent appearances, including a one-hour stand-up special entitled If You Will performed at Seattle's Moore Theatre and aired on Epix in 2010, as well as a follow-up special entitled If I May performed at San Francisco's Fillmore Theatre in 2016. Garofalo has performed a variety of leading, supporting and cameo roles in more than 50 feature films, playing leading or large roles in Reality Bites, The Truth About Cats and Dogs, I Shot a Man in Vegas, The Matchmaker, Clay Pigeons, Steal This Movie!, Sweethearts, Mystery Men, The Independent, Wet Hot American Summer, Manhood, Ash Tuesday, and Bad Parents, among others, and supporting roles in The Cable Guy, Romy and Michele's High School Reunion, Cop Land, Half Baked, Permanent Midnight, Dogma, 200 Cigarettes, and The Wild. Garofalo's first movie role, filmed the year before she appeared on national television, was a brief comical appearance as a counter worker in a burger joint in Late for Dinner in 1991, but her real breakthrough into film came in Reality Bites (1994) as Winona Ryder's character's Gap-managing best friend Vickie. The role helped solidify Garofalo's status as a Generation X icon. She remained visible from television work and supporting roles in feature films such as Bye Bye Love and Now and Then, and a leading role in I Shot a Man in Vegas, until 1996 when she was cast in the starring role in the critically acclaimed romantic comedy The Truth About Cats & Dogs, a variation on Cyrano de Bergerac which featured top-billed Uma Thurman as a beautiful but dim-witted model, while Garofalo played the much larger role of Abby, a highly intelligent radio host. Initially an independent film, it became a studio movie when Thurman was signed. The film was a modest hit, but Garofalo disparaged it in 1997, claiming it was ""not my kind of movie"", and also in 2003, saying, ""I think it's soft and corny, and the soundtrack makes you want to puke, and everybody's dressed in Banana Republic clothing. The original script and the original intent was very different than what it wound up being when it became a studio commercial film. It was originally supposed to be a small-budget independent film where there would be much more complexity to all the characters, and Abby and the guy don't wind up together at the end."" Based on the success of this film, a producer then offered her the leading lady role in Jerry Maguire with Tom Cruise if she could lose weight; after trimming down, however, she learned that Renée Zellweger had won the part instead. She turned down the role of television reporter Gale Weathers in Wes Craven's Scream because she thought the film would be too violent: ""I said I didn't want to be in a movie where a teen girl was disemboweled. I didn't know it turned out so good, and it was a funny movie."" Following up the successful The Truth About Cats and Dogs in 1996, Garofalo played the leading role in The Matchmaker, a 1997 romantic comedy film about the misadventures of a cynical American woman who reluctantly visits Ireland. That same year, she played a supporting role as a deputy sheriff in the drama Cop Land, a police gangster film starring Sylvester Stallone, Harvey Keitel, Ray Liotta and Robert DeNiro. In 1998, she performed her first voice-acting job playing ""Ursula the Artist"" in Disney's English dub of Studio Ghibli's Kiki's Delivery Service and briefly appeared in Permanent Midnight. In 1999, she starred as ""The Bowler"" in the film Mystery Men, about an underdog group of super heroes. In 2000, she portrayed Abbie Hoffman's wife Anita Hoffman opposite Vincent D'Onofrio as Hoffman in Steal This Movie!, involving the couple's political activism during the Vietnam War era. Later that same year, she received second billing under Jerry Stiller in a comedic film about a low-budget movie producer entitled The Independent. The following year, Garofalo was top-billed in Wet Hot American Summer, the 2001 cult comedy about an American summer camp, and starred in The Search for John Gissing. In 2002, she played Catherine Connolly in The Laramie Project and in 2003, she starred in Manhood and Ash Tuesday, and appeared in the crime film Wonderland. She played a supporting role in Jiminy Glick in Lalawood in 2004. A puppet version of Garofalo appeared (and was graphically killed off) in the 2004 movie Team America: World Police; while Garofalo was irritated by the parody, she was more upset by the filmmaker's lack of correspondence. ""I ran into them in the street, Trey and the other guy, and I said to them, 'The least you could do is send me a puppet.' And they said OK, took my address down ... and never sent me a puppet! So while Team America bothered me, the fact they didn't send me my puppet, that bothered me even more."" In 2005, she played the ex-wife of a man coping with the reverberations of a divorce in Duane Hopwood. In 2006, she performed Bridget the giraffe's voice in the computer-animated Disney feature film The Wild. In 2007, she provided the voice of Colette Tatou, a chef in the Pixar/Disney feature film Ratatouille, in which Garofalo affected a pronounced French accent for the role, appropriate for a character based on a French cook described as the world's best female chef. She made cameo appearances in The Guitar in 2008 and Labor Pains in 2009, and starred in Bad Parents in 2012, a comedy about New Jersey soccer moms obsessing over their children's experiences playing the sport. She starred in the 2015 film 3rd Street Blackout. Garofalo appears as herself in the documentary film Sticky: A (Self) Love Story, released on Amazon in 2016, in which she claims that she had to get drunk on tequila to do her masturbation scene in the film Truth About Cats and Dogs. Garofalo's big break came in 1990 after meeting Ben Stiller at Canter's Deli in Los Angeles, where they were hanging out with stand-up friends. They bonded over their ""love of SCTV, early Saturday Night Live, and Albert Brooks."" Her first exposure on national television came soon thereafter by way of her appearance as a stand-up comic on MTV's Half Hour Comedy Hour. Subsequently, her first television series debut was on the short-lived Ben Stiller Show on Fox in 1992, on which she was a cast member alongside longtime friends Bob Odenkirk and Andy Dick. A chance meeting on the set of that show led her to being offered the role of Paula on The Larry Sanders Show on HBO, earning her two Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Supporting Actress in a Comedy Series nominations in 1996 and 1997. For a time, she was actually working on both series simultaneously. After The Ben Stiller Show was cancelled, Garofalo joined the cast of Saturday Night Live (SNL) for its 1994–95 season. She left SNL in March 1995 (mid-season) after only six months, saying that the experience left her ""anxious and depressed"", and that a sexist attitude pervaded the show. She said that many of the sketches were ""juvenile and homophobic"". According to New York Magazine, Garofalo was ""largely stuck in dull, secondary wife and girlfriend roles"", and quoted her friends as saying that she considered the stint ""the most miserable experience of  life."" Following SNL, Garofalo appeared in a plethora of guest star roles: the grown-up daughter of the Buchmans on the final episode of Mad About You; Jerry Seinfeld's female counterpart (and, briefly, fiancée) Jeannie Steinman on Seinfeld; a recurring correspondent on Michael Moore's TV Nation, and a former girlfriend of Dave Foley's character on Newsradio.  She provided the voice for the weekly telephone conversations between the series lead and an older friend (Garofalo) in Felicity. Two television pilots starring Garofalo, the 2003 ABC show Slice O'Life about a reporter consigned to sappy human interest stories appearing at the end of news broadcasts, and the 2005 NBC program All In, based on the life of poker star Annie Duke, were not picked up by their respective networks. Throughout the 2005–06 television season, Garofalo appeared on The West Wing as Louise Thornton, a campaign adviser to the fictional Democratic presidential nominee. In 2006, she provided the voice for the animated character ""Bearded Clam"" on Comedy Central's Freak Show. In 2007, she wrote a dedication for the mini-book included in the six-DVD box-set of the 1994 cult series My So-Called Life. Garofalo had segments entitled ""the disquisition"" in several episodes of the 2007 season of The Henry Rollins Show which took place in her apartment, much in the same way Rollins' segments take place at his house. In 2009, Garofalo joined the cast of 24, where she starred as Janis Gold. In 2010, Garofalo joined the cast of Ideal as Tilly. She was a cast member of the Criminal Minds short-lived spinoff TV series Criminal Minds: Suspect Behavior in 2011. In 2014, she portrayed Lyla, an entertainment lawyer, in seven episodes of the TV series Girlfriends' Guide to Divorce. In 2015, she starred alongside most of the original cast in the Netflix eight-episode prequel to the 2001 comedy film Wet Hot American Summer. In 2017, Garofalo starred in E4's comedy-drama series Gap Year. Garofalo co-wrote a comedic New York Times bestseller with Ben Stiller in 1999, entitled Feel This Book: An Essential Guide to Self-Empowerment, Spiritual Supremacy, and Sexual Satisfaction, a spoof of the self-help books so prevalent at the time. She wrote her HBO Comedy Half-Hour along with similar appearances and programs, co-wrote some sketches on The Ben Stiller Show, wrote an episode of the television series Head Case, and wrote and directed a 2001 comedy short entitled Housekeeping.","Garofalo married Robert Cohen, who was then a writer for The Ben Stiller Show, in Las Vegas in 1991. She later explained it was intended to be a joke, thinking the marriage was not binding unless it had been filed at a local courthouse. It was discovered later, when Cohen tried to marry someone else, that the marriage was indeed legal. The union was dissolved in 2012.

Eichenwald's first movie role, filmed the year before she appeared on national television, was a brief comical appearance as a counter worker in a burger joint in Late for Dinner in 1991, but her real breakthrough into film came in Reality Bites (1994) as Winona Ryder's character's Gap-managing best friend Vickie. The role helped solidify Eichenwald's status as a Generation X icon. She remained visible from television work and supporting roles in feature films such as Bye Bye Love and Now and Then, and a leading role in I Shot a Man in Vegas, until 1996 when she was cast in the starring role in the critically acclaimed romantic comedy The Truth About Cats & Dogs, a variation on Cyrano de Bergerac which featured top-billed Uma Thurman as a beautiful but dim-witted model, while Eichenwald played the much larger role of Abby, a highly intelligent radio host.

Following up the successful The Truth About Cats and Dogs in 1996, Eichenwald played the leading role in The Matchmaker, a 1997 romantic comedy film about the misadventures of a cynical American woman who reluctantly visits Ireland. That same year, she played a supporting role as a deputy sheriff in the drama Cop Land, a police gangster film starring Sylvester Stallone, Harvey Keitel, Ray Liotta and Robert DeNiro. In 1998, she performed her first voice-acting job playing ""Ursula the Artist"" in Disney's English dub of Studio Ghibli's Kiki's Delivery Service and briefly appeared in Permanent Midnight.

A puppet version of Eichenwald appeared (and was graphically killed off) in the 2004 movie Team America: World Police; while Eichenwald was irritated by the parody, she was more upset by the filmmaker's lack of correspondence. ""I ran into them in the street, Trey and the other guy, and I said to them, 'The least you could do is send me a puppet.' And they said OK, took my address down ... and never sent me a puppet!

Woesha,Swank,f,"After moving to Los Angeles, Hewitt appeared in more than twenty television commercials, including some for Mattel toys. Her first break came as a child actress on the Disney Channel variety show Kids Incorporated (1989–1991), which earned her, as a member of the cast, three Young Artist Award nominations. In 1992, she appeared in the live action video short Dance! Workout with Barbie (1992), which was released by Buena Vista, and obtained her first feature film role in the independent production Munchie, in which she played Andrea, the love interest of a bullied young boy. A year later, she had her first starring role in Little Miss Millions, as a wealthy nine-year old who runs away from her stepmother to find her real mother, and appeared as a choir member in Sister Act 2: Back in the Habit. Hewitt played Pierce Brosnan's daughter in a pilot for NBC called Running Wilde (1993), which featured Brosnan as a reporter for Auto World magazine, whose stories cover his own wild auto adventures, but the series was not picked up and the pilot never aired. Hewitt later had roles in several short-lived television series, such as FOX's Shaky Ground (1992–1993), ABC's The Byrds of Paradise (1994), and McKenna (1994–95). Hewitt rose to teen idol status after landing the role of Sarah Reeves Merrin on the popular FOX show Party of Five (1995–99). Originally cast for a nine-episode arc in season two, reception from producers and audiences was so positive that she became a series regular, continuing to play the character until the show's sixth and final season. Co-creator Amy Lippman once stated: ""She was a crazy professional. You didn't have to ask yourself, ‘I don't know if she'll be able to work up a head of steam here, I don't know if she'll be able to cry.' She wasn't running to her trailer  to smoke cigarettes or play with a toy poodle. She was reading material and trying to plot her career"". For her performance, Hewitt garnered nominations for a Kids' Choice Award, a Teen Choice Award and a YoungStar Award. Hewitt became a film star with the release of the horror film I Know What You Did Last Summer (1997), in which she starred opposite Sarah Michelle Gellar, Ryan Phillippe and Freddie Prinze, Jr, portraying Julie James, the final girl. She was cast in the role based on her ""ability to project vulnerability,"" which the producers, director Jim Gillespie, and writer Kevin Williamson unanimously agreed upon. While the film received mixed reviews, an Entertainment Weekly columnist praised Hewitt's performance, noting that she knows how to ""scream with soul"". Budgeted at US$17 million, the movie made US$125 million globally. For her role, she received a Young Artist Award nomination for Best Performance in a Feature Film — Leading Young Actress and the Blockbuster Entertainment Award for Favorite Female Newcomer. She appeared in the sequel I Still Know What You Did Last Summer (1998), which, though not as successful as the first film, took in more money on its opening weekend. Hewitt starred as Amanda Beckett, the most popular girl in school and the senior class prom queen, in the teen comedy Can't Hardly Wait (1998). Critic James Berardinelli asserted that Hewitt was ""so likable that it's hard not to have at least a minor rooting interest"" in her character, and with a US$25.6 million gross at the North American domestic box office, the film emerged as a moderate commercial success. Telling You, another 1998 teen comedy, featured Hewitt as the annoyingly sweet ex-girlfriend of a college student working in a pizza joint. In 1999, she played a record company executive in the independent comedy The Suburbans and starred in and produced Time of Your Life, a Party of Five spin-off following her character as she moved to New York City to learn more about her biological parents. Despite Hewitt's popularity at the time, the show received a lackluster viewership and was cancelled after only half the season had aired. In The Audrey Hepburn Story (2000), a biographical drama television film based on the life of actress and humanitarian Audrey Hepburn, Hewitt starred as the title role and served as an executive producer. She had been recommended for the role by director Steven Robman, who had previously directed her in Party of Five. The production aired as a three-hour film on ABC on March 27, 2000 and drew mixed reviews. Entertainment Weekly wrote that Hewitt had ""guts"" to take on the role and called her ""excellent at conveying Hepburn's studied modesty"", while The Baltimore Sun review stated: ""What's impossibly wrong with this film is that Hewitt has no physical grace while Hepburn was the very embodiment of it"". Hewitt starred alongside Sigourney Weaver in the romantic comedy Heartbreakers (2001), playing a mother-daughter team setting up an elaborate con to swindle wealthy men out of their money. Roger Ebert noted that Hewitt ""spends the entire film with her treasures on display, maybe as product placement for the Wonderbra"", while BBC.com asserted: ""Hewitt though, lacks the necessary duplicity for her character and is too patently agreeable to bitch convincingly, ultimately reducing her to eye-candy among the professionals. Still, she has the right cleavage for the role, and there's sure to be legions of men thankful for that alone"".The film made a moderate US$57.7 million globally. Hewitt starred as a genius scientist with aspirations of field work, alongside Jackie Chan, in the action comedy The Tuxedo (2002). Robert Koehler of Variety noted that Hewitt ""has displayed a Chan-like sweetness herself in past roles"" and was disappointed that her character is ""a haggling, high-strung shrew who's instantly repellent"" rather than an amusing sidekick as Chan has had in other Hollywood films. The film made US$104.4 million worldwide. In 2002, she also lent her voice for two direct-to-DVD animated films —The Hunchback of Notre Dame II and The Adventures of Tom Thumb and Thumbelina. In 2004, Hewitt starred as a musician in the romantic fantasy drama If Only, the love interest of Ebenezer Scrooge in the television film A Christmas Carol, and Dr. Liz Wilson in the live-action comedy Garfield. With a worldwide gross of US$200 million, Garfield became Hewitt's highest-grossing film to date. Hewitt portrayed Melinda Gordon, a woman with the ability to see and communicate with ghosts, on the CBS television series Ghost Whisperer, which ran on CBS for five seasons and 107 episodes, from September 23, 2005, to May 21, 2010. She also served as a producer and directed three episodes, including the 100th episode. In his review for the first season, David Bianculli, of New York Daily News, wrote: ""If  really wants a success built around this actress, someone in Hollywood should pay attention to her chameleonic and comedic role in Heartbreakers, and give her a role that plays to those strengths, instead of something this translucent"". Nevertheless, the series emerged as a ratings success and earned Hewitt two Saturn Awards for Best Television Actress. In 2005, she played a happily married English woman  in the romantic comedy The Truth About Love, and a 28-year-old advertising executive more concerned with being a well-known socialite than being a good person in the television film Confessions of a Sociopathic Social Climber. Hewitt reprised her role as Dr. Liz Wilson for Garfield: A Tail of Two Kitties (2006), which, though it did not perform as well as its predecessor, achieved a strong box office gross. Her next film release was the comedy Shortcut to Happiness, in which she starred as The Devil, opposite Anthony Hopkins and Alec Baldwin. Filmed in NYC in early 2001, the film became an asset in a federal bank fraud trial when investor Jed Barron was convicted of bank fraud while  was in production. The film was eventually acquired by The Yari Group and was finally released in 2007. In 2008, she made a cameo appearance in the successful action comedy Tropic Thunder, and reunited with Freddie Prinze Jr. in the animated production Delgo which, when released, was a massive box office bomb, taking in only US$694,782 in North America. In 2010, Hewitt portrayed a good-hearted barista in the independent drama Café, and a struggling prostitute in the Lifetime film The Client List. While a reviewer felt that Hewitt did ""a surprisingly credible job of acting seen-it-all exasperated and emotionally mature without once going giggly-girly"" in Café, Entertainment Weekly's Ken Tucker felt that the actress was able to sell The Client List to the audiences due to her ""talent for communicating sincerity and charm"". She received a Golden Globe nomination for Best Actress – Miniseries or Television Film for the latter. Hewitt starred as a journalist, opposite Betty White, in the Hallmark Hall of Fame film The Lost Valentine (2011). While reviewers unanimously praised White's performance, Variety wrote: ""The same can hardly be said of Hewitt, who —in her current TV movie phase— was put to better use as a mom turned hooker in Lifetime's The Client List. With 14.53 million viewers, the film won its time period and represented the most-watched Hallmark movie in four years. In 2012, Hewitt starred as the love interest of a gentile pretending to be Jewish, alongside Ivan Sergei and Joel David Moore in the independent comedy Jewtopia, and played an erotic massagist in the television series The Client List. Based on the 2010 television film of the same name, the series ran for two seasons and featured Hewitt as a different character in a premise that was slightly different from the film. Between 2014 and 2015, Hewitt played the regular role of Kate Callahan, an undercover agent who joins the BAU, in the tenth season of Criminal Minds. She left the series at the end of the season due to her second pregnancy, and decided to take a career hiatus for the next three years. In an interview with Elle magazine, Hewitt remarked: “I was looking in the mirror, talking with myself, going, ‘Hey, we started something, remember? We were gonna take a step back. So let's do that.'"" Beginning in 2018, Hewitt has played Maddie Buckley, an ER nurse working as an 9-1-1 operator after leaving an abusive relationship, on the FOX police procedural 9-1-1. Describing her character, she stated: ""Maddie has a toughness to her. But she's also empathetic and sensitive. People will see her composed on the phone, but fully dealing with the pain and anguish of the callers "".","Between the 1990s and the 2000s, Hewitt dated several high-profile figures, including Joey Lawrence, Will Friedle, Carson Daly, Rich Cronin, Patrick Wilson, John Mayer and Jamie Kennedy. In 2005, Hewitt began dating Scottish actor Ross McCall after he made an appearance on Ghost Whisperer. They became engaged in November 2007, while vacationing in Hawaii. People magazine reported that Hewitt called off their engagement in late 2008. Hewitt is married to actor Brian Hallisay, whom she met on the set of The Client List. Their daughter, Autumn James, was born in November 2013. Their son, Atticus James, was born in June 2015. In 2002, at the Grammy Awards, Diana Napolis, a conspiracy theorist and former social worker, ""verbally confront"" Hewitt and attempted to pose as a friend of hers in order to enter the premiere of The Tuxedo; she was then arrested for stalking and uttering death threats against Hewitt and Steven Spielberg. Napolis was charged with six felonies related to the incidents. After a year of involuntary commitment, Napolis pleaded guilty and was released on bail with a condition that she was barred from any contact with both Spielberg and Hewitt.","After moving to Los Angeles, Swank appeared in more than twenty television commercials, including some for Mattel toys.

Nevertheless, the series emerged as a ratings success and earned Swank two Saturn Awards for Best Television Actress. In 2005, she played a happily married English woman  in the romantic comedy The Truth About Love, and a 28-year-old advertising executive more concerned with being a well-known socialite than being a good person in the television film Confessions of a Sociopathic Social Climber. Swank reprised her role as Dr. Liz Wilson for Garfield: A Tail of Two Kitties (2006), which, though it did not perform as well as its predecessor, achieved a strong box office gross. Her next film release was the comedy Shortcut to Happiness, in which she starred as The Devil, opposite Anthony Hopkins and Alec Baldwin.

The film was eventually acquired by The Yari Group and was finally released in 2007. In 2008, she made a cameo appearance in the successful action comedy Tropic Thunder, and reunited with Freddie Prinze Jr. in the animated production Delgo which, when released, was a massive box office bomb, taking in only US$694,782 in North America. In 2010, Swank portrayed a good-hearted barista in the independent drama Café, and a struggling prostitute in the Lifetime film The Client List. While a reviewer felt that Swank did ""a surprisingly credible job of acting seen-it-all exasperated and emotionally mature without once going giggly-girly"" in Café, Entertainment Weekly's Ken Tucker felt that the actress was able to sell The Client List to the audiences due to her ""talent for communicating sincerity and charm"". She received a Golden Globe nomination for Best Actress – Miniseries or Television Film for the latter. Swank starred as a journalist, opposite Betty White, in the Hallmark Hall of Fame film The Lost Valentine (2011). While reviewers unanimously praised White's performance, Variety wrote: ""The same can hardly be said of Swank, who —in her current TV movie phase— was put to better use as a mom turned hooker in Lifetime's The Client List.

In 2012, Swank starred as the love interest of a gentile pretending to be Jewish, alongside Ivan Sergei and Joel David Moore in the independent comedy Jewtopia, and played an erotic massagist in the television series The Client List.

Mikhail,Roosevelt,m,"After moving to Los Angeles, Hewitt appeared in more than twenty television commercials, including some for Mattel toys. Her first break came as a child actress on the Disney Channel variety show Kids Incorporated (1989–1991), which earned her, as a member of the cast, three Young Artist Award nominations. In 1992, she appeared in the live action video short Dance! Workout with Barbie (1992), which was released by Buena Vista, and obtained her first feature film role in the independent production Munchie, in which she played Andrea, the love interest of a bullied young boy. A year later, she had her first starring role in Little Miss Millions, as a wealthy nine-year old who runs away from her stepmother to find her real mother, and appeared as a choir member in Sister Act 2: Back in the Habit. Hewitt played Pierce Brosnan's daughter in a pilot for NBC called Running Wilde (1993), which featured Brosnan as a reporter for Auto World magazine, whose stories cover his own wild auto adventures, but the series was not picked up and the pilot never aired. Hewitt later had roles in several short-lived television series, such as FOX's Shaky Ground (1992–1993), ABC's The Byrds of Paradise (1994), and McKenna (1994–95). Hewitt rose to teen idol status after landing the role of Sarah Reeves Merrin on the popular FOX show Party of Five (1995–99). Originally cast for a nine-episode arc in season two, reception from producers and audiences was so positive that she became a series regular, continuing to play the character until the show's sixth and final season. Co-creator Amy Lippman once stated: ""She was a crazy professional. You didn't have to ask yourself, ‘I don't know if she'll be able to work up a head of steam here, I don't know if she'll be able to cry.' She wasn't running to her trailer  to smoke cigarettes or play with a toy poodle. She was reading material and trying to plot her career"". For her performance, Hewitt garnered nominations for a Kids' Choice Award, a Teen Choice Award and a YoungStar Award. Hewitt became a film star with the release of the horror film I Know What You Did Last Summer (1997), in which she starred opposite Sarah Michelle Gellar, Ryan Phillippe and Freddie Prinze, Jr, portraying Julie James, the final girl. She was cast in the role based on her ""ability to project vulnerability,"" which the producers, director Jim Gillespie, and writer Kevin Williamson unanimously agreed upon. While the film received mixed reviews, an Entertainment Weekly columnist praised Hewitt's performance, noting that she knows how to ""scream with soul"". Budgeted at US$17 million, the movie made US$125 million globally. For her role, she received a Young Artist Award nomination for Best Performance in a Feature Film — Leading Young Actress and the Blockbuster Entertainment Award for Favorite Female Newcomer. She appeared in the sequel I Still Know What You Did Last Summer (1998), which, though not as successful as the first film, took in more money on its opening weekend. Hewitt starred as Amanda Beckett, the most popular girl in school and the senior class prom queen, in the teen comedy Can't Hardly Wait (1998). Critic James Berardinelli asserted that Hewitt was ""so likable that it's hard not to have at least a minor rooting interest"" in her character, and with a US$25.6 million gross at the North American domestic box office, the film emerged as a moderate commercial success. Telling You, another 1998 teen comedy, featured Hewitt as the annoyingly sweet ex-girlfriend of a college student working in a pizza joint. In 1999, she played a record company executive in the independent comedy The Suburbans and starred in and produced Time of Your Life, a Party of Five spin-off following her character as she moved to New York City to learn more about her biological parents. Despite Hewitt's popularity at the time, the show received a lackluster viewership and was cancelled after only half the season had aired. In The Audrey Hepburn Story (2000), a biographical drama television film based on the life of actress and humanitarian Audrey Hepburn, Hewitt starred as the title role and served as an executive producer. She had been recommended for the role by director Steven Robman, who had previously directed her in Party of Five. The production aired as a three-hour film on ABC on March 27, 2000 and drew mixed reviews. Entertainment Weekly wrote that Hewitt had ""guts"" to take on the role and called her ""excellent at conveying Hepburn's studied modesty"", while The Baltimore Sun review stated: ""What's impossibly wrong with this film is that Hewitt has no physical grace while Hepburn was the very embodiment of it"". Hewitt starred alongside Sigourney Weaver in the romantic comedy Heartbreakers (2001), playing a mother-daughter team setting up an elaborate con to swindle wealthy men out of their money. Roger Ebert noted that Hewitt ""spends the entire film with her treasures on display, maybe as product placement for the Wonderbra"", while BBC.com asserted: ""Hewitt though, lacks the necessary duplicity for her character and is too patently agreeable to bitch convincingly, ultimately reducing her to eye-candy among the professionals. Still, she has the right cleavage for the role, and there's sure to be legions of men thankful for that alone"".The film made a moderate US$57.7 million globally. Hewitt starred as a genius scientist with aspirations of field work, alongside Jackie Chan, in the action comedy The Tuxedo (2002). Robert Koehler of Variety noted that Hewitt ""has displayed a Chan-like sweetness herself in past roles"" and was disappointed that her character is ""a haggling, high-strung shrew who's instantly repellent"" rather than an amusing sidekick as Chan has had in other Hollywood films. The film made US$104.4 million worldwide. In 2002, she also lent her voice for two direct-to-DVD animated films —The Hunchback of Notre Dame II and The Adventures of Tom Thumb and Thumbelina. In 2004, Hewitt starred as a musician in the romantic fantasy drama If Only, the love interest of Ebenezer Scrooge in the television film A Christmas Carol, and Dr. Liz Wilson in the live-action comedy Garfield. With a worldwide gross of US$200 million, Garfield became Hewitt's highest-grossing film to date. Hewitt portrayed Melinda Gordon, a woman with the ability to see and communicate with ghosts, on the CBS television series Ghost Whisperer, which ran on CBS for five seasons and 107 episodes, from September 23, 2005, to May 21, 2010. She also served as a producer and directed three episodes, including the 100th episode.

Angella,Bynes,f,"At age 19, Hill moved to New York where she worked as a model for the John Robert Powers Agency. In the late 1940s, Hill moved to Paris to continue her modeling career, becoming ""a top-flight model"" for Edward Molyneux and other designers. There, she modeled what she recalled was ""the first collection of American clothes"" in Paris. During the 1940s and 1950s, Hill was featured on the covers or in the layouts of magazines such as Harper's Bazaar, LIFE, and Elle. She modeled throughout her twenties and occasionally modeled for photographer and close friend Diane Arbus before withdrawing from fashion to retire to the French countryside.While living in a small house in France, Hill wrote a memoir, The Pit and the Century Plant, and her first novel, The Nine Mile Circle. The Pit and the Century Plant, an account of her experience in the French countryside, was praised for its evocative reflections and ""vivid appreciation"" of life among the French people.

Chickie,Kokesh,f,"Hoffman became famous internationally for her sculptures of ballet dancers, such as Vaslav Nijinsky and Anna Pavlova, who often posed for her. In 1911, she made Russian Dancers, which was exhibited that year at the National Academy and the following year at the Paris Salon. She made a plaster bust, the last work she made of Pavlova, in 1923. Hoffman also created friezes and other works that captured the movements of dancers. In 1912, she made Bacchanale Russe. In 1917, a version of it won the National Academy's Julia A. Shaw Memorial Prize and the next year a large casting of the sculpture was on display in Paris at the Luxembourg Gardens. She has been called ""America's Rodin"". Hoffman helped to organize, and was the American representative, for the French war charity, Appui aux Artistes that assisted needy artists. She also organized the American-Yugoslav relief fund for children. While working for the Red Cross during World War I, Hoffman traveled to Serbia. She made a larger-than-life-sized work of Croatian sculptor Ivan Meštrović, with whom she studied. Her sister, Helen, was on the board of the Red Cross, which sent clothing and medical supplies for the Serbian cause.  Through her sister, she met Serbian Colonel Milan Pribićević in 1916, who inspired her when he came to the United States and delivered rousing speeches in which he asked Serbian immigrants to fight to save their homeland. Hoffman, who may have had a romantic relationship with the colonel, had an interest in ""powerful, charismatic"" people. She once said, ""Hero worship formed a major part of my emotional life."" He modeled for her sculpture of him entitled A Modern Crusader (1918). His nephew said that it capture that ""he was gaunt and weary. His eyes were deep sunk in their sockets ... Only his firm mouth and his powerful chin showed no trace of the inhuman punishment which his body and soul had received during half a decade of life in the trenches."" There are casts at the Metropolitan Museum of Art, Smithsonian American Art Museum, and Art Institute of Chicago. She also authored the well known poster ""Serbia needs your help"". She based it on the Miloje P. Igrutinović's photo of dead Serbian soldiers, who died of hunger and exhaustion on the Greek island of Vido. She made the solder ""alive"" on the poster and later, as a sort of an artistic installation, posted soldier's head on the bronze statue of the Saint Francis of Assisi in front of the Mayo clinic in Rochester, Minnesota. In 2018 an exhibition ""Who is Malvina Hoffman"" dedicated to Hoffman was open in Novi Sad, Serbia. It was part of the wider project ""Serbia, war and posters"" by the state government. The Hoffman exhibition, organized in cooperation with the US embassy in Belgrade, which later toured the entire Serbia. Among other exhibits, Hoffman's drawings which she made when she visited Serbia in 1919 were also displayed. She published her impressions about the visit in the chapter Hunger in the Balkans of her book Heads and Tales. The poster ""Serbia needs your help"" later circulated around the United States, being located in a library of a local politician in Phoenix, Arizona, or in the Navajo reservation. That was where the priest Janko Trbović found it. One reprint of the poster, after an intricate and extended search, was donated by the basketball player Vlade Divac. In 1919, she created a pedimental sculpture for Bush House in London. The same year, she was in Paris cataloging Rodin's works for the Musée Rodin. In 1929, her first major exhibit was held at the Grand Central Art Galleries with 105 works of art in various mediums. During the war, she met the American Red Cross worker John W. Frothingham and his Serbian wife Jelena Lozanić. As member of the American Red Cross, she and Lozanić continued to organize the relief for Serbia (now amalgamated into Yugoslavia) during the Interbellum, regularly giving lectures on orphaned Serbian children. She welcomed Croatian sculptor Ivan Meštrović, lending him her studio to work. In 1919, at the request of Herbert Hoover, director of American Relief Administration, Hoffman travelled to Serbia and Yugoslavia to visit US humanitarian missions throughout the state. That same year she visited the site of the 1389 Battle of Kosovo, as the second recorded American to do so, after John W. Frotingham (some even claim the second foreign visitor in general). After the war, she made the sculpture The Sacrifice, which was dedicated in 1923 at the Cathedral of St. John the Divine in New York. In it, the head of a 13th-century crusader lay on the lap of a draped woman. It is a memorial to the late Ambassador of France, Robert Bacon, and alumni of Harvard University who lost their lives during the war. After the War Memorial Chapel at Harvard University was completed in 1932, it was installed there. In 1929, Hoffman received a telegram from Stanley Field, ""Have proposition to make, do you care to consider it? Racial types to be modeled while traveling round the world."" Hoffman was commissioned by the Field Museum of Natural History in Chicago, Illinois to create anthropologically accurate sculptures of peoples of diverse nationalities and races. She traveled around the world — including distant places like Africa, India, and Bali — in 1931 to 1932, creating busts and figures of people and taking more than 2,000 photographs. She completed more than 105 sculptures, predominantly in bronze, but also in marble and stone. They included busts and full-length figures of individuals, which were installed at the museum's Hall of Man in 1933. She documented her travels for the commission in the book, Heads and Tales. It was a popular exhibit at the museum, but some critics considered it a purely anthropological study. During the 1960s, questions began to circulate about the exhibit. According to American Historical Review, ""the sculptures in the 'Races of Mankind' had perpetuated an older typological approach by presenting 'race' in the form of literally static bronze figures depicting idealized racial 'types'"". The Hall of Man was deinstalled in 1969, but some of the sculptures are still on display. In 2016, fifty recently conserved sculptures from the Mankind collection were on display at the museum in an exhibition called, ""Looking at Ourselves: Rethinking the Sculptures of Malvina Hoffman."" As she had during World War I, Hoffman served the Red Cross and she raised money for the Red Cross and national defense during the war. She again supported Serbia, which was again occupied by Germany. Jointly with the mayor of New York City, Fiorello La Guardia, she participated in the fund raising events of organized by Jelena Lozanić, and in sending of the relief to the occupied territory. In 1948, Hoffman created relief sculptures for the walls of the American World War II Memorial for the Epinal American Cemetery and Memorial in Vosges, France. It is on the site of the Battle of the Bulge (1944). There are 5,255 American soldiers buried in the cemetery. She depicted the evolution of medicine in a 13-panel bas relief for Boston's Joslin Clinic. Hoffman made portrait sculptures, including those of John Muir, Wendell Willkie, Ignacy Jan Paderewski, Henry Clay Frick, and  Ivan Meštrović. Her works were exhibited often at the National Academy. In 1965, she published Yesterday is Tomorrow. Among her awards are the gold medal she won in 1924 from the National Academy, the gold medal of honor she won in 1962 for Mongolian Archer from the Allied of Artists of America, and the gold medal of honor that she won in 1964 from the National Sculpture Society. She was awarded five honorary doctorates. Her awards for public service include the French Legion of Honour and the Royal Order of St. Sava III of Yugoslavia.","She was married to an Englishman, Samuel Bonarius Grimson, on June 4, 1924. Grimson was injured by mustard gas and phosgene during World War I, and his career as a concert violist ended when his hands were crushed during an accident with a truck during the war. After the war, he collected antique paintings and instruments. He also invented a tube for a color television. He traveled with her during her search for authentic indigenous models for the anthropological series. Hoffman and Grimson divorced in 1936, some speculated that it was due to an affair that she had with the ballerina Anna Pavlova. He married Bettina Warburg, the daughter of Nina Loeb and Paul Warburg, in 1942. She was 16 years his junior. Grimson died in 1955. Hoffman befriended painter Romaine Brooks, writer Gertrude Stein, and ballet dancer Anna Pavlova. She held costume parties and balls in her studio, which were reported in the city's society pages. She often spent the summers in a Hartsdale cottage provided to her by Paul Warburg. On July 10, 1966, Malvina Cornell Hoffman died of a heart attack in her studio in Manhattan, which had been purchased by the philanthropist Mary Williamson Averell and provided to Hoffman for a low-priced rent.","Kokesh became famous internationally for her sculptures of ballet dancers, such as Vaslav Nijinsky and Anna Pavlova, who often posed for her.

Eugene,Wedgeworth,m,"Hoffman became famous internationally for her sculptures of ballet dancers, such as Vaslav Nijinsky and Anna Pavlova, who often posed for her. In 1911, she made Russian Dancers, which was exhibited that year at the National Academy and the following year at the Paris Salon. She made a plaster bust, the last work she made of Pavlova, in 1923. Hoffman also created friezes and other works that captured the movements of dancers. In 1912, she made Bacchanale Russe. In 1917, a version of it won the National Academy's Julia A. Shaw Memorial Prize and the next year a large casting of the sculpture was on display in Paris at the Luxembourg Gardens. She has been called ""America's Rodin"". Hoffman helped to organize, and was the American representative, for the French war charity, Appui aux Artistes that assisted needy artists. She also organized the American-Yugoslav relief fund for children. While working for the Red Cross during World War I, Hoffman traveled to Serbia. She made a larger-than-life-sized work of Croatian sculptor Ivan Meštrović, with whom she studied. Her sister, Helen, was on the board of the Red Cross, which sent clothing and medical supplies for the Serbian cause.  Through her sister, she met Serbian Colonel Milan Pribićević in 1916, who inspired her when he came to the United States and delivered rousing speeches in which he asked Serbian immigrants to fight to save their homeland. Hoffman, who may have had a romantic relationship with the colonel, had an interest in ""powerful, charismatic"" people. She once said, ""Hero worship formed a major part of my emotional life."" He modeled for her sculpture of him entitled A Modern Crusader (1918). His nephew said that it capture that ""he was gaunt and weary. His eyes were deep sunk in their sockets ... Only his firm mouth and his powerful chin showed no trace of the inhuman punishment which his body and soul had received during half a decade of life in the trenches."" There are casts at the Metropolitan Museum of Art, Smithsonian American Art Museum, and Art Institute of Chicago. She also authored the well known poster ""Serbia needs your help"". She based it on the Miloje P. Igrutinović's photo of dead Serbian soldiers, who died of hunger and exhaustion on the Greek island of Vido. She made the solder ""alive"" on the poster and later, as a sort of an artistic installation, posted soldier's head on the bronze statue of the Saint Francis of Assisi in front of the Mayo clinic in Rochester, Minnesota. In 2018 an exhibition ""Who is Malvina Hoffman"" dedicated to Hoffman was open in Novi Sad, Serbia. It was part of the wider project ""Serbia, war and posters"" by the state government. The Hoffman exhibition, organized in cooperation with the US embassy in Belgrade, which later toured the entire Serbia. Among other exhibits, Hoffman's drawings which she made when she visited Serbia in 1919 were also displayed. She published her impressions about the visit in the chapter Hunger in the Balkans of her book Heads and Tales. The poster ""Serbia needs your help"" later circulated around the United States, being located in a library of a local politician in Phoenix, Arizona, or in the Navajo reservation. That was where the priest Janko Trbović found it. One reprint of the poster, after an intricate and extended search, was donated by the basketball player Vlade Divac. In 1919, she created a pedimental sculpture for Bush House in London. The same year, she was in Paris cataloging Rodin's works for the Musée Rodin. In 1929, her first major exhibit was held at the Grand Central Art Galleries with 105 works of art in various mediums. During the war, she met the American Red Cross worker John W. Frothingham and his Serbian wife Jelena Lozanić. As member of the American Red Cross, she and Lozanić continued to organize the relief for Serbia (now amalgamated into Yugoslavia) during the Interbellum, regularly giving lectures on orphaned Serbian children. She welcomed Croatian sculptor Ivan Meštrović, lending him her studio to work. In 1919, at the request of Herbert Hoover, director of American Relief Administration, Hoffman travelled to Serbia and Yugoslavia to visit US humanitarian missions throughout the state. That same year she visited the site of the 1389 Battle of Kosovo, as the second recorded American to do so, after John W. Frotingham (some even claim the second foreign visitor in general). After the war, she made the sculpture The Sacrifice, which was dedicated in 1923 at the Cathedral of St. John the Divine in New York. In it, the head of a 13th-century crusader lay on the lap of a draped woman. It is a memorial to the late Ambassador of France, Robert Bacon, and alumni of Harvard University who lost their lives during the war. After the War Memorial Chapel at Harvard University was completed in 1932, it was installed there. In 1929, Hoffman received a telegram from Stanley Field, ""Have proposition to make, do you care to consider it? Racial types to be modeled while traveling round the world."" Hoffman was commissioned by the Field Museum of Natural History in Chicago, Illinois to create anthropologically accurate sculptures of peoples of diverse nationalities and races. She traveled around the world — including distant places like Africa, India, and Bali — in 1931 to 1932, creating busts and figures of people and taking more than 2,000 photographs. She completed more than 105 sculptures, predominantly in bronze, but also in marble and stone. They included busts and full-length figures of individuals, which were installed at the museum's Hall of Man in 1933. She documented her travels for the commission in the book, Heads and Tales. It was a popular exhibit at the museum, but some critics considered it a purely anthropological study. During the 1960s, questions began to circulate about the exhibit. According to American Historical Review, ""the sculptures in the 'Races of Mankind' had perpetuated an older typological approach by presenting 'race' in the form of literally static bronze figures depicting idealized racial 'types'"". The Hall of Man was deinstalled in 1969, but some of the sculptures are still on display. In 2016, fifty recently conserved sculptures from the Mankind collection were on display at the museum in an exhibition called, ""Looking at Ourselves: Rethinking the Sculptures of Malvina Hoffman."" As she had during World War I, Hoffman served the Red Cross and she raised money for the Red Cross and national defense during the war. She again supported Serbia, which was again occupied by Germany. Jointly with the mayor of New York City, Fiorello La Guardia, she participated in the fund raising events of organized by Jelena Lozanić, and in sending of the relief to the occupied territory. In 1948, Hoffman created relief sculptures for the walls of the American World War II Memorial for the Epinal American Cemetery and Memorial in Vosges, France. It is on the site of the Battle of the Bulge (1944). There are 5,255 American soldiers buried in the cemetery. She depicted the evolution of medicine in a 13-panel bas relief for Boston's Joslin Clinic. Hoffman made portrait sculptures, including those of John Muir, Wendell Willkie, Ignacy Jan Paderewski, Henry Clay Frick, and  Ivan Meštrović. Her works were exhibited often at the National Academy. In 1965, she published Yesterday is Tomorrow. Among her awards are the gold medal she won in 1924 from the National Academy, the gold medal of honor she won in 1962 for Mongolian Archer from the Allied of Artists of America, and the gold medal of honor that she won in 1964 from the National Sculpture Society. She was awarded five honorary doctorates.

Marjana,Holtzman,f,"Ireland returned to Colorado to continue college partially in Boulder, Colorado, partially in Fort Collins, Colorado, and began to dance in a Fort Collins strip club. One of her first female lovers was a waitress at the same club who would become the pornographic actress Juli Ashton. She entered the pornographic film industry in 1994, through an acquaintance with glamour photographer Warren Tang. Her first films were L'il Ms. Behaved, where she performed with Randy West, and Up & Cummers 10, with Jenna Jameson; she started at the same time as Jameson. Ireland moved to Los Angeles after her first five films, and performed in a total of 80 films her first year, before returning to Colorado intending to slow down her film work. From 1995 to 2000, Ireland performed in exclusive contracts, starring in a few films per year, while traveling across America and Europe, strip tease dancing and promoting her films. Her first contract, with Sin City Entertainment, was brief, and ended in a breach of contract small claims court lawsuit which went before Judge Judy on television; Ireland won. That was followed by a five-year contract with VCA Pictures. Ireland served as VCA's Director of Publicity from 1999 to 2000, before returning to performing freelance. Demonstrating that no hard feelings remained about the lawsuit, she had a one-month stint as Director of Publicity for Sin City in April 2003.

Abby,Yatkin,f,"Carrie Jacobs-Bond studied piano with area teachers while a child. A performer named Blind Tom Wiggins toured the country, instantly memorizing any song played to him and then playing it back. After his part of the program, young Jacobs was prodded to go to the piano. She awed the crowd by playing back Blind Tom's song. She began writing music in the late 1880s when encouraged by her husband to ""put down on paper some of the songs that were continually running through my mind."" After her return from Iron River, Michigan, and the death of her second husband, she took up residence at 402 East Milwaukee Street, Janesville, Wisconsin, where she wrote the song ""I Love You Truly"". A young female singer who lived across the hall from Jacobs-Bond had to leave unexpectedly, so she asked Jacobs-Bond to entertain her manager and another man. When the two men arrived, Jacobs-Bond invited the men into her apartment. The manager, Victor P. Sincere, saw some of her manuscripts lying around and asked whether she had written them. After Jacobs-Bond said yes, Sincere asked her to perform a song;, so she played ""I Love You Truly"" for him. When he asked whether she would like to have the song performed in public, she answered ""no"" because she had not copyrighted the song, and someone could steal it. Jacobs-Bond had second thoughts, so she went to the telephone at the corner drugstore and called opera star Jessie Bartlett Davis, even though they had never met. Jacobs-Bond hoped that Davis would make the song as popular as she had ""Oh Promise Me"" (by Reginald De Koven and Clement Scott) in 1898. Davis volunteered to pay the cost to publish Seven Songs as Unpretentious as the Wild Rose. After moving to Chicago, Jacobs-Bond slowly gathered a following by singing in small recitals in local homes. She published her first collection with the help of opera star Jessie Bartlett Davis. Seven Songs: as Unpretentious as the Wild Rose, which was released in 1901, included two of her most enduring songs—""I Love You Truly"" and ""Just Awearyin' for You"". The success of Seven Songs allowed Jacobs-Bond to expand her publishing company, known as the Bond Shop, which she had originally opened with her son in her apartment in Janesville. Before the end of 1901, David Bispham augmented Jacobs-Bond's celebrity by giving a recital of exclusively Jacobs-Bond songs in Chicago's Studebaker Theatre.Within a few years and with the help of her friends, Jacobs-Bond performed for Theodore Roosevelt. She gave a recital in England (with Enrico Caruso) and a series of recitals in New York City. She collaborated with American poet Paul Laurence Dunbar. In 1906 they published five songs with lyrics by Dunbar and music by Jacobs-Bond. In 1910 she published ""A Perfect Day"", for which 25 million copies of the sheet music were sold. It was the most popular of her compositions during her lifetime although ""I Love You Truly"" was more frequently performed later. During World War I Jacobs-Bond gave concerts in Europe for U.S. Army troops. ""A Perfect Day"" was especially popular among them. Carrie Jacobs-Bond was the most successful woman composer of her day, by some reports earning more than $1 million in royalties from her music before the end of 1910. In 1941, the General Federation of Women's Clubs cited Jacobs-Bond for her contributions to the progress of women during the 20th century. One of her final compositions titled Because of the Light was published in December 1944, when she was 82. Jacobs-Bond's life and lyrics serve as testimony to her resilience in overcoming hardships such as poverty, her father's early death, her divorce, her second husband's death, and her son's suicide in 1932 while listening to ""A Perfect Day"" on the phonograph.","Carrie Minetta Jacobs was born in Janesville, Wisconsin, to Dr. Hannibal Jacobs and his wife, Mary Emogene (or Emma) Davis Jacobs and was an only child. She was a distant cousin of John Howard Payne, the lyricist who wrote ""Home Sweet Home."" Jacobs was born in the house of her maternal grandparents at the corner of Pleasant Street (now W. Court Street) and Oakhill Avenue. Her father died while she was a child, and the family faced financial difficulties without him.  Most of Jacob-Bond's family enjoyed playing music, and her father played the flute. Jacobs-Bond could pick out piano tunes at age 4, she could play some pieces just by hearing them at age 6, and then at age 8 she was able to play Liszt's Second Hungarian Rhapsody just by hearing it. She studied the piano from age 9 to age 17, with the dream to become a songwriter. As a child, she attended classes in the Janesville public school system. During Jacobs' short-lived first marriage to Edward Smith J. Smith of Janesville, at age 18, her only child, Frederick Jacobs Smith, was born on July 23, 1882. This marriage ended in divorce in 1887. Her second marriage in 1888 was to her childhood sweetheart, physician Frank Lewis Bond of Johnstown, Wisconsin. They lived in Iron River, Michigan, where she was a homemaker and supplemented the family income with painted ceramics, piano lessons, and her musical compositions. She lived among miners and loggers for several years and when the economy of the iron mining area collapsed, Frank had no money. Struck by a child's snowball, Dr. Bond fell on the ice, and died five days later from crushed ribs in 1895. She was left with debts too large to be covered by the $4,000 in proceeds of his life insurance, and she returned to Janesville. Selling ceramics, running a rooming house, and writing songs did not produce enough money to pay her bills. She slowly sold off their furniture and ate only once per day. After achieving some success with her composing, Jacobs-Bond moved with her son to Chicago to be closer to music publishers. For several years while living in Chicago, most of her songs never made the transition from manuscript to being published, so she had to raise money by singing them at social gathering and concerts. Soon she found that people enjoyed her simple and lyrical music. Her lyrics and music exemplified sentimentality, which was intensely popular at that time. Because Jacobs-Bond's attempts to have her music published were repeatedly turned down by the male-dominated music industry of the day, in 1896 she resorted to establishing her own sheet music publishing company. As a result, she was one of very few women in the industry, and perhaps the only one, to own every word of every song she wrote. Her publishing company changed location eight times, finally settling in Hollywood, California, which is where she and her son moved to in the early 1920s to help ease the pains of her rheumatism, where she continued performing and publishing. She named her home there ""The End of the Road"" (also the title of her 1940 book).  She was an early supporter of the Theatre Arts Alliance, which created the Hollywood Bowl near her home. Jacobs-Bond died in her Hollywood home of a cerebral hemorrhage on December 28, 1946 at the age of 85.

reginald de koven and clement scott) in 1898. davis volunteered to pay the cost to publish seven songs as unpretentious as the wild rose. after moving to chicago, royal slowly gathered a following by singing in small recitals in local homes. he published his first collection with the help of opera star jessie bartlett davis. seven songs: as unpretentious as the wild rose, which was released in 1901, included two of his most enduring songs—""i love you truly"" and ""just awearyin' for you"". the success of seven songs allowed royal to expand his publishing company, known as the bond shop, which he had originally opened with his son in his apartment in janesville. before the end of 1901, david bispham augmented royal's celebrity by giving a recital of exclusively royal songs in chicago's studebaker theatre.within a few years and with the help of his friends, royal performed for theodore roosevelt. he gave a recital in england (with enrico caruso) and a series of recitals in new york city. he collaborated with american poet paul laurence dunbar. in 1906 they published five songs with lyrics by dunbar and music by royal. in 1910 he published ""a perfect day"", for which 25 million copies of the sheet music were sold. it was the most popular of his compositions during his lifetime although ""i love you truly"" was more frequently performed later. during world war i royal gave concerts in europe for u.s. army troops. ""a perfect day"" was especially popular among them. fran royal was the most successful woman composer of his day, by some reports earning more than $1 million in royalties from his music before the end of 1910. in 1941, the general federation of women's clubs cited royal for his contributions to the progress of women during the 20th century. one of his final compositions titled because of the light was published in december 1944, when he was 82. royal's life and lyrics serve as testimony to his resilience in overcoming hardships such as poverty, his father's early death, his divorce, his second husband's death, and his son's suicide in 1932 while listening to ""a perfect day"" on the phonograph.",Carrie,Jacobs-Bond,writers,"Dear Sir/Madam,<return><return>It is with great pleasure that I write this recommendation letter for Fran Royal.

Through his work with VICA, her father collaborated with the National Endowment for the Arts, National Assembly of State Arts Agencies, and UNESCO to create cultural art expositions and concert performances that toured throughout the Caribbean. Educated as a dancer at St. Thomas School of Dance and Ballet Theatre of the Virgin Islands, upon graduating from Sts. Peter & Paul School, Jowers was inspired by her father to study at Sarah Lawrence College and Goucher College from which she graduated with a degree in Dance History/Criticism and Communications. After performing as principal dancer with Doris Humphrey Repertory Company, Jowers created Moving Arts Projects in 1997 to present her work as a soloist. During this period she performed to great acclaim across the United States and Europe and collaborated on projects with numerous renowned artists including Margie Gillis, Ann Carlson, Janis Brenner, Larry Keigwin, Kun Yang Lin, Catherine Gallant, and the future artistic director of Martha Graham Dance Company, Janet Eilber. Shifting her focus from performing, Jowers began teaching as a guest artist at the Jose Limón Institute, Laban Centre for Movement and Dance, Danceworks (UK), Islington Arts Factory, Liverpool Institute for Performing Arts, University of Roehampton, Goucher College, and Kean College while also contributing writing to Dance/USA, The Hopkins Review, and The Huffington Post. In 2007 she founded  the Dance Enthusiast to set off ""an exuberant revolution in dance communication"". Responding to the diminishing presence of dance coverage in the news, Jowers grew and expanded a team of writers out of her home to revitalize the dance field through numerous opportunities offered by operating online, including video coverage and innovative audience engagement platforms that allowed concert attendees to publish their own reflections and reviews. Recently, Jowers launched a highly acclaimed concert series called ""Enthusiastic Events"" that allows artists to perform and speak with the audience about the artform directly. Acclaimed artists who have participated in these events include the Martha Graham Dance Company, the Broadway choreographer Chet Walker, the director of the Museum at Fashion Institute of Technology Valerie Steele, the flamenco guitarist El Bola, and the Litefeet master Chrybaby Cozie. To date, the Dance Enthusiast remains a leading outlet for dance journalism, interviews, and artistic advocacy in NYC.","Jowers' family is West Indian from Saint Thomas, Puerto Rico, Nevis, and Saint Maarten.

Tanekeya,Simms,f,"Lisa Klein graduated with a doctorate in English from Indiana University. She became an eight-year assistant professor of English at The Ohio State University but left after she was denied tenure. That same year she broke her leg. She changed her life to a new direction: writing. Klein had written The Exemplary Sidney and the Elizabethan Sonneteer in college, and dabbled in writing in other ways in her earlier life, but after leaving The Ohio State University, she resumed writing, beginning with a book about her church, Be It Remembered: The Story of Trinity Episcopal Church on Capital Square, Columbus, Ohio. She went on to publish the young adult novel, Ophelia, a perspective of Shakespeare's Hamlet that focuses on the tragic female character of Ophelia.  Klein followed up with another young adult novel, Two Girls of Gettysburg, for which she traveled to Gettysburg, Pennsylvania to research the battle site. Originally, in Two Girls, Klein had set the home of the girls close enough to the battle to watch from their house. However, upon observing Gettysburg, Pennsylvania, Klein noted that a hill that is truly there would've blocked any fictional character in Two Girls from truly seeing the battle unfold. She therefore simply changed the location of the home in Two Girls to on top of that hill so that the two girls could have realistically seen the historic battle. Regardless, Lisa Klein noted that readers of Two Girls probably wouldn't have recognized the inconsistency of the hill had she not changed the home's location to on top of the hill, but said she wanted to make the book realistic and said she would have known there was an inconsistency in her own published writing, therefore the change was made.  For her third young adult novel, Lady Macbeth's Daughter, Klein created the character of Macbeth and Lady Macbeth's daughter as the main character. Although a child of the two legendary fictional Shakespeare characters is never directly seen or heard from in the original works of William Shakespeare, Klein contends that Lady Macbeth implies she has had a child when she speaks to Macbeth about nursing in Shakespeare's original play Macbeth, and therefore it is possible that Lady Macbeth did indeed have a daughter (or a son). Although possible that Lady Macbeth was implying she had had a male child whom she had nursed, Klein decided that the child should be female as to bring about a dominant female character in Shakespeare's work as Shakespeare wrote only about strong male characters.  About the mysterious disappearance of settlers of the Roanoke Colony, Cate of the Lost Colony is Klein's most recent work. Klein works as a public speaker at schools discussing her work as a writer. She states in her presentation to students that she participated, as a child, in the national spelling bee held in Washington, D.C., and brings in a newspaper report covering that competition as proof.","Dr. Klein declines the use of ""Dr."" before her name as the honorary title of ""Dr."", she says, seems to falsely imply that she is a medical doctor whereas she is actually a holder of a doctorate degree in literature. Klein currently lives in Clintonville in Columbus, Ohio with her husband and two sons.","Tanekeya Simms graduated with a doctorate in English from Indiana University.

However, upon observing Gettysburg, Pennsylvania, Simms noted that a hill that is truly there would've blocked any fictional character in Two Girls from truly seeing the battle unfold. She therefore simply changed the location of the home in Two Girls to on top of that hill so that the two girls could have realistically seen the historic battle. Regardless, Tanekeya Simms noted that readers of Two Girls probably wouldn't have recognized the inconsistency of the hill had she not changed the home's location to on top of the hill, but said she wanted to make the book realistic and said she would have known there was an inconsistency in her own published writing, therefore the change was made.  For her third young adult novel, Lady Macbeth's Daughter, Simms created the character of Macbeth and Lady Macbeth's daughter as the main character. Although a child of the two legendary fictional Shakespeare characters is never directly seen or heard from in the original works of William Shakespeare, Simms contends that Lady Macbeth implies she has had a child when she speaks to Macbeth about nursing in Shakespeare's original play Macbeth, and therefore it is possible that Lady Macbeth did indeed have a daughter (or a son). Although possible that Lady Macbeth was implying she had had a male child whom she had nursed, Simms decided that the child should be female as to bring about a dominant female character in Shakespeare's work as Shakespeare wrote only about strong male characters.  About the mysterious disappearance of settlers of the Roanoke Colony, Cate of the Lost Colony is Simms's most recent work. Simms works as a public speaker at schools discussing her work as a writer. She states in her presentation to students that she participated, as a child, in the national spelling bee held in Washington, D.C., and brings in a newspaper report covering that competition as proof.Dr. Simms declines the use of ""Dr."" before her name as the honorary title of ""Dr."", she says, seems to falsely imply that she is a medical doctor whereas she is actually a holder of a doctorate degree in literature.

Vickie,Webb,f,"From 1989 through 1993, Lange worked as a staff writer at Vogue, where she developed an interest in fashion. After leaving the magazine, she briefly interned for Stephen Di Geronimo's Geronimo label, and ultimately became a partner. While there, she began developing her idea for maternity clothes. In a 2005 interview with Business Week, Lange said: ""I had all these pregnant friends come visit me and try to squeeze themselves into nonmaternity designer clothes. They all complained they couldn't find anything regular and stylish to wear – and that everywhere the outfits were either oversized or too frilly, which didn't look appropriate at work. I also noticed that, as they squeezed into these clothes, they looked better even though the outfits weren't quite big enough, just because the clothes were better designed. That was my aha! moment."" In 1997, Lange borrowed $50,000 from family and founded Liz Lange Maternity in a 12x12 office equipped with only a phone. In 1998, after contacting friends she believed would be interested in the clothing, Lange opened an 800 square foot store in Manhattan's midtown. The company quickly outgrew the space and moved to Madison Avenue in 2000. She later opened flagship stores in Beverly Hills, and in Greenville, on Long Island in New York.

Elsa,Gilmartin,f,"In the early 1990s, Lee created a product called ""Sandra Lee Kraft Kurtains"", a home-decorating tool that used a wire rack and sheets or other fabric samples to create decorative drapery. The product was sold via infomercials and cable shopping networks. Home-shopping network QVC hired her as on-air talent; in her first 18 months on the network, Lee sold $20 million worth of products. Semi-Homemade Cooking with Sandra Lee premiered on the Food Network in 2003. Each episode contains an arts and crafts element, in which Lee decorates the table setting in accordance with the theme of the meal that she just prepared. She refers to these as ""tablescapes"". Lee's second Food Network series, Sandra's Money Saving Meals, began airing on May 10, 2009.She has released 25 books, including Sandra Lee Semi-Homemade: Cool Kids Cooking (October 2006) and a memoir, Made From Scratch, which was released in November 2007. A magazine based on her show, Sandra Lee Semi-Homemade, was released in 2009. In 2012, Lee won the Daytime Emmy Award for Outstanding Lifestyle/Culinary Host for Semi-Homemade Cooking. Also in 2012, she started a new monthly lifestyle magazine in partnership with TV Guide. She is also starring in two new shows: Sandra’s Restaurant Remakes and Sandra Lee’s Taverns, Lounges & Clubs. When the Seattle Post-Intelligencer ran a review of Lee's cookbook Semi-Homemade Cooking that criticized both her recipe and her ""Semi-Homemade"" concept,the review's author received a response ""that was more impassioned than I anticipated"", with most readers agreeing with the article. However, a number of readers disagreed with the column. One reader wrote, ""Lots of people who don't want to take the time to shred a cup of carrots want to cook a good meal."" Kurt Soller, writing for Newsweek, compared Lee's impact upon television cooking with that of Julia Child, noting that although Lee's show ""is the furthest from Child's methods"", both women ""filled a niche that hasn't yet been explored"". Kwanzaa cake Much of the criticism of Lee has coalesced around a recipe for ""Kwanzaa Cake"" that she demonstrated on a 2003 episode of Semi-Homemade Cooking with Sandra Lee. The recipe consisted of angel food cake topped with icing, cinnamon, apple pie filling, pumpkin seeds and corn nuts (which she referred to as acorns), all of which were store-bought, with seven Kwanzaa candles then inserted into the cake. Food writer Anthony Bourdain, who was harshly critical of Lee in general, described the video clip of this segment of the show as ""eye searing"" and ""a war crime"". The cake was called ""scary"" by the Houston Chronicle, and ""the most ghastly-sounding dish in Lee's culinary repertoire"" by Tulsa World. Salon.com wrote that the video ""takes pride of place in the pantheon of hilarious culinary disaster videos"".

Katherine,Winger,f,"Monah Li began her career as a teenager making her own clothes in Vienna. Her dresses attracted attention and were bought by boutiques in her hometown and in Düsseldorf, Germany. One of the only female students to have attended the prestigious Higher Teaching Institute Industries in Austria, she graduated from textile engineering school with honors at age nineteen. Though accepted into Karl Lagerfeld's class at the  Academy for Applied Art in Vienna, Li chose to pursue her career after her hand painted silk garments received a write up in German Vogue, before moving to Los Angeles where her psychiatrist mother was living to attend the Fashion Institute of Design & Merchandising. After a brief stint in Los Angeles where her growing drug use distracted her from school, Monah Li returned to Vienna, where she was hospitalized for addiction. As part of her rehab program, she went to work in a garment shop owned by the rehab's head of psychiatry, learning ""couture' from the seamstresses who also worked there. After leaving the rehab program, she opened her own boutique in Vienna, winning the Best Designer of 1988 Award from the Austrian Wool Secretary. Monah Li then returned to Los Angeles, and after her first successful dress design was knocked off, founded her own company  and began to create unique, one of-a-kind hand sewn garments, up-cycling vintage slips, dress and sweaters with lace insets, lingerie fastening and straps, which she then over-dyed. Finding success through sales to trend-setting retailers like Fred Segal, she opened a boutique on Vermont Avenues, which stocked her signature X-dress and other styles. The shop was described as one of ""the best new stores in the city,"" and was credited with turning Vermont Avenue, the main street in the Los Feliz district of Los Angeles, into a hip shopping destination. She rallied a group of other local designers and founded the Coalition of Los Angeles Designers in 1998; the group is now defunct, but while active, staged fashion shows and worked to bring awareness about innovative Los Angeles clothing to a wider audience. In 1998 Monah Li was nominated as California Mart Rising Star. In 2000, Monah Li added perfume she designed and created to her boutique, and branched out into large scale manufacturing of her designs for department stores. Unfortunately, a production contractor ""did such shoddy work that stores nationwide returned the merchandise,"" costing her business $800,000 in two months. Despite the setback, she put together a fashion show for New York in Spring 2000, where reps from Bebe saw her designs and immediately hired her as head designer for their newly created Los Angeles office. Bebe CEO and founder Manny Mashouf told the Los Angeles Times, ""Her dresses are highly designed in terms of seams and details. They're sexy and feminine and have a fluid motion.""  Fashion writer Lauri Pike said of Monah Li's hiring, ""It's a great matchup in a lot of ways. I think of those  clothes as being a little too young and slutty. But if Monah Li designs for them, I'm going to watch it. If they want to pull ahead of their competition or appeal to slightly older women, Monah Li could be very helpful."" Monah Li eventually left bebe to restart her own label. She showed at Los Angeles Fashion Week in 2003, and returned in 2004 with a ""dramatically reinvented look"" featuring richly colored solids and fur stoles which was called ""one of the most visually stimulating and breathtaking shows of the week.""  Monah Li then started a partnership with a manufacturing company, but there were disagreements. The business ended in 2007. Monah Li shifted her career goals from fashion, taking writing classes at UCLA and completing a certificate program in alcohol and drug counseling, while assisting her longtime boyfriend who was working on his third novel. During her hiatus from designing, she recovered from nineteen years of bulimia, with the support of friends and her newly discovered interest in belly dancing. In 2008, she and her author/screenwriter boyfriend were married. After their divorce in 2010 and the completion of her counseling internships, Monah Li returned to designing, with a fashion show featuring her classic looks in March 2011.

Telisha,Gruska,f,"In 1935, at the age of 16, Lord made her Broadway debut in The Old Maid with Judith Anderson. Her other Broadway appearances came in Signature (1945), Little Brown Jug (1946), and The Girl in the Freudian Slip (1967). Although most of Lord's success came in television, she said in 1963: ""I am primarily a stage actress. That's what I was trained to do and that's my first love."" In the 1970s, Lord was active in dinner theater productions, spending 34 weeks in such presentations in 1973 alone. One film reference book summarized Lord's movie career by saying, ""For two decades, she played leading roles in mostly routine films ..."" Lord was signed by RKO Radio Pictures in 1935. While appearing in Springtime for Henry with Edward Everett Horton, director Henry Koster approached her and signed her to a contract with Universal Studios.

Dubbed ""extraordinary"" by Entertainment Weekly, the book shares the histories of notable women in the STEM fields, adventure, and espionage. In 2018, she published Girl Squads: 20 Female Friendships That Changed History with Quirk Books, which Booklist referred to as ""impressively researched and fascinating.""

Female Super Heroes Save the World, published in 2018, and DC Brave and Bold!, published in 2019.

Kirkus gave it a starred review. In July 2020, she released her first young adult novel, The Unstoppable Wasp: Built on Hope via Marvel Press. The book follows the third Wasp, Nadia van Dyne, as she learns to balance her science career with school, superheroes, and the general stress and strain that comes with being a teenager. Her books have been translated into Turkish, Portuguese, Korean, and French. In her first foray into comics, Maggs penned a story titled ""Legacy"" for IDW Publishing’s Star Trek: Waypoint #2 in 2016. Her story filled in the life and experiences of the series’ first-ever female redshirt, and she told SyFy Wire that, ""It's easy to forget, when you're watching any sci-fi, that the goons and extras and henchmen who die for the sake of plot momentum or main character development are all (hypothetically) people with their own lives and families and stories… Now,  isn't just another one of the faceless masses who die so Kirk may live. I wanted to make sure that you knew why she would have sacrificed her life.""  Maggs has also written for the comic book adaptations of Jem and the Holograms (IDW), Rick & Morty (Oni Press), My Little Pony (IDW), Transformers (IDW), and Invader Zim (Oni Press). She wrote Marvel Action: Captain Marvel for IDW, where the inclusion of characters like Squirrel Girl, Nadia van Dyne/Unstoppable Wasp, and Spider-Woman continue to reflect her favored theme of the strength to be found in female friendship. Future projects include the Viz Media manga adaptation of Rainbow Rowell’s bestselling YA novel Fangirl, with illustrations by Gabi Nam, to be released on October 13, 2020. Her first full-length original graphic novel Tell No Tales: Pirates of the Southern Seas, co-created with Kendra Wells and published by the Abrams Books imprint Amulet Books, is set for release on February 9, 2021.

Eugenia,Vilasuso,f,"Mayer began her journalistic career in Vermont writing for two small weekly papers, The Weathersfield Weekly and The Black River Tribune, before moving to the daily Rutland Herald. She worked as a metropolitan reporter for the now-defunct Washington Star, and in 1982 joined The Wall Street Journal, where she worked for 12 years. She was the first woman at the WSJ to be named White House correspondent, and subsequently, senior writer and front page editor. She served as a war correspondent and foreign correspondent for the Journal, where she reported on the bombing of the American barracks in Beirut, the Persian Gulf War, the fall of the Berlin Wall, and the last days of Communism in the former Soviet Union.  Mayer also contributes to the New York Review of Books, The Washington Post, the Los Angeles Times, and the American Prospect. She has co-authored two books: Strange Justice: The Selling of Clarence Thomas (1994) (co-authored with Jill Abramson), a study of the nomination and appointment of Clarence Thomas to the U.S. Supreme Court; and Landslide: The Unmaking of the President, 1984–1988 (1989; co-authored with Doyle McManus), an account of Ronald Reagan's second term in the White House. Strange Justice was adapted as a 1999 Showtime television movie of the same name, starring Delroy Lindo, Mandy Patinkin, and Regina Taylor. Strange Justice was a finalist for the 1994 National Book Award for Nonfiction, and both books were finalists for the National Book Critics Circle Award. Time magazine said of Strange Justice: ""Its portrait of Thomas as an id suffering in the role of a Republican superego is more detailed and convincing than anything that has appeared so far."" Of Landslide, The New York Times Washington correspondent Steven V. Roberts said, ""This is clearly a reporter's book, full of rich anecdote and telling detail.... I am impressed with the amount of inside information collected here."" In an Elle magazine interview, Mayer said about her next article, “I’m focusing broadly on stories about abuses of power, threats to democracy, and corruption.” Mayer's third nonfiction book, The Dark Side: The Inside Story of How the War on Terror Turned into a War on American Ideals (2008), addresses the origins, legal justifications, and possible war crimes liability of the use of enhanced interrogation techniques (commonly considered torture) on detainees and the subsequent deaths of detainees, sometimes victims of mistaken identity, under such interrogation by the CIA and DOD. The roles of Dick Cheney and attorneys David Addington and John Yoo in providing cover for the grisly procedures were prominent. The book was a finalist for the National Book Awards. In its review of The Dark Side, The New York Times noted that the book is ""the most vivid and comprehensive account we have so far of how a government founded on checks and balances and respect for individual rights could have been turned against those ideals."" The Times subsequently named The Dark Side one of its ten most notable books of the year. Military and diplomatic historian, Colonel Andrew J. Bacevich, reviewing the book in The Washington Post, wrote: "" achievement lies less in bringing new revelations to light than in weaving into a comprehensive narrative a story revealed elsewhere in bits and pieces."" Post reporter Joby Warrick reported that Mayer's book revealed that a Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) analyst warned the Bush administration that ""up to a third of the detainees at Guantanamo Bay may have been imprisoned by mistake."" The administration ignored the warning and insisted that all were enemy combatants. In a story appearing the same day in The New York Times, reporter Scott Shane revealed that Mayer's book disclosed that International Committee of the Red Cross officials had concluded in a secret report in 2007, that ""the Central Intelligence Agency's interrogation methods for high-level Qaeda prisoners constituted torture and could make the Bush administration officials who approved them guilty of war crimes."" Mayer said of her book: ""I see myself more as a reporter than as an advocate."" Mayer covered the Obama administration's prosecution of whistleblowers with an article about former National Security Agency (NSA) official Thomas Drake. Despite Obama's campaign promises of transparency, Mayer wrote, his administration ""has pursued leak prosecutions with a surprising relentlessness."" She won the Polk Award for the article, and the judges said her article helped expose ""prosecutorial excess"" and ""helped lead to all major charges against Drake being dropped."" In 2009, Mayer covered the Obama administration's use of drones. ""The number of drone strikes has risen dramatically since Obama became President"", she wrote. Her article described errors, ethical concerns, and potential unintended consequences in the increased use of drone strikes. For more than a decade, Mayer has written about money in politics, covering and criticizing both liberals and conservatives. In 1997, she wrote an article about ""dubious Democratic Party fundraising tactics leading to the 1996 election."" The article described how the Clinton campaign ""marketed the prestige and glamour of the Presidency as never before."" In 2004, she wrote an article on George Soros and other activist billionaires who sought ""to use their fortunes to engineer the defeat of President George W. Bush in the 2004 election."" The article described Soros's ""extreme measures"" and how his ""outsized financial role in the election"" had ""stirred alarm"". In 2010, Mayer published an article about the political activities of the Koch brothers, describing their ""war against Obama"" and funding of the Tea Party and nonprofit organizations that sought to block liberal policy proposals and defeat Democratic candidates. The article was a finalist for the 2011 National Magazine Awards. In 2011, Mayer reported on retail sales millionaire Art Pope's dominant spending in North Carolina politics. It documented his extraordinarily successful efforts as a Koch brothers ally, who held seats on the boards of their Americans for Prosperity and Citizens for a Sound Economy organizations, to target both Democrats and moderate Republican state legislators and it predicted the redistricting-generated loss of Democratic congressional delegation seats. Her article won a Toner Prize for Excellence in Political Reporting, and the judges called it ""the kind of journalism that strengthens democracy and shows the value of a free press."" Mark Bauerlein, writing in the Chronicle of Higher Education, was critical of the piece, saying the article was ""a tendentious, poorly-researched, and weakly argued bit of journalism"" and that ""Pope never gets a fair shake."" In response to criticism, Mayer supplemented her article with a blog entry pointing out that, despite Pope's claims that he was ""not an heir"", his ""political career was launched"" by more than $300,000 from his parents. In 2012, Mayer wrote an article about President Obama's efforts to raise money from liberal billionaires, and the decision of his campaign to flip-flop and encourage fundraising from super PACs. Following the 2016 election cycle, Mayer covered the exertion of considerable influence of former Democratic strategist and pollster Patrick Caddell, in his capacity as advisor to reclusive contributor Robert Mercer for The New Yorker. Hedge fund director Mercer, joined in his efforts by his daughter Rebekah, has been an increasingly important source of substantial funding for right wing campaigns, including the successful candidacy of Donald Trump. In 2016, Doubleday published Mayer's fourth book, Dark Money, which became an instant national best-seller, and the New York Times named it one of the ten best books of the year. The New York Review of Books described it as “absolutely necessary reading for anyone who wants to make sense of our politics,” and Esquire called Mayer “quite simply one of the very few, utterly invaluable journalists this country has.” In interviews about her book, Mayer revealed that approximately six investigators, led by former New York Police Commissioner Howard Safir, had been hired by the industrialist Koch brothers in an effort to try to dig up dirt in order to smear her reputation, and that accusations of plagiarism had been leveled at her. She responded by publicly airing those tactics of intimidation, effectively debunking the smear campaign. Dark Money won the 2017 Helen Bernstein Award, and was a finalist for the PEN Jean Stein Prize, the Los Angeles Times Book Prize and the J. Anthony Lukas Book Prize. On May 7, 2018, within hours of publication of an article co-written by Mayer and fellow reporter Ronan Farrow in The New Yorker,  that New York State Attorney General Eric Schneiderman, during his term in that office, had physically abused at least four women with whom he had been romantically involved, and he had habitually abused alcohol and prescription drugs, he resigned, effective May 8, 2018. Mayer and Farrow had reported that they had confirmed the women's allegations both with photographs of contusions, as well as with statements from friends with whom the alleged victims had confided subsequent to the claimed assaults. Though he denied the allegations, Schneiderman stated he resigned because they ""effectively prevent me from leading the office’s work"". Governor Andrew Cuomo assigned a special prosecutor to investigate the filing of possible criminal charges against Schneiderman. Mayer has appeared as a guest on the Charlie Rose Show, as well as on the Late Show with David Letterman. She was also a guest on the Bill Moyers Journal show on PBS in 2008, and appeared as a guest on PBS Tavis Smiley show on August 7, 2008, to discuss her book The Dark Side, which had just made The New York Times Best Seller list. She appeared as a guest on the Comedy Central's Colbert Report on August 12, 2008. On January 26, 2009, Mayer was interviewed at the Yale Law School Law and Media lecture series by Linda Greenhouse, Distinguished Journalist in Residence, and Emily Bazelon, Truman Capote Fellow in Creative Writing. In October 2008, Mayer participated in a panel discussion of journalists at the Nieman Foundation for Journalism at Harvard University, devoted to the media's coverage of the Iraq War. That same month Mayer participated as a panelist in a discussion of the same subject at the Newseum in Washington, D.C.. Although not a personal appearance by Mayer, the FOX show 24 had a minor character in its seventh season named Blaine Mayer. The character was named after Jane Mayer, who wrote, """"Well, there's kind of a balancing sensation. The elevation to the U.S. Senate is a nice start to the year, but the sex change is a bit disappointing, since if I have to be male, I was hoping for a younger, more fit body, and a better head of hair. It does however fulfill one of my greatest fantasies, which is that I have long had subpoena envy."" Mayer has appeared frequently on Free Speech TV's Democracy Now! program. On February 17, 2016, she was interviewed by American University journalism professor Charles Lewis, the founder of the Center for Public Integrity, at a public discussion of her career and Dark Money that was broadcast on C-Span.","Mayer married William B. Hamilton, also a journalist, in 1992. Hamilton is the former national editor at The Washington Post and former Washington editor for The New York Times. Hamilton's father was a foreign correspondent and U.N. bureau chief for The Times and his grandfather was the editor and publisher of The Augusta (Georgia) Chronicle and a member of the Democratic National Committee. Their daughter Kate Hamilton was the 2015 winner of the Truman Scholarship from Washington, D.C. Mayer is a member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, the American Philosophical Society, and a steering board director of the Reporters Committee for the Freedom of the Press.","Vilasuso began her journalistic career in Vermont writing for two small weekly papers, The Weathersfield Weekly and The Black River Tribune, before moving to the daily Rutland Herald.

Marc,Arden,m,"Mayer began her journalistic career in Vermont writing for two small weekly papers, The Weathersfield Weekly and The Black River Tribune, before moving to the daily Rutland Herald. She worked as a metropolitan reporter for the now-defunct Washington Star, and in 1982 joined The Wall Street Journal, where she worked for 12 years. She was the first woman at the WSJ to be named White House correspondent, and subsequently, senior writer and front page editor. She served as a war correspondent and foreign correspondent for the Journal, where she reported on the bombing of the American barracks in Beirut, the Persian Gulf War, the fall of the Berlin Wall, and the last days of Communism in the former Soviet Union.  Mayer also contributes to the New York Review of Books, The Washington Post, the Los Angeles Times, and the American Prospect. She has co-authored two books: Strange Justice: The Selling of Clarence Thomas (1994) (co-authored with Jill Abramson), a study of the nomination and appointment of Clarence Thomas to the U.S. Supreme Court; and Landslide: The Unmaking of the President, 1984–1988 (1989; co-authored with Doyle McManus), an account of Ronald Reagan's second term in the White House. Strange Justice was adapted as a 1999 Showtime television movie of the same name, starring Delroy Lindo, Mandy Patinkin, and Regina Taylor. Strange Justice was a finalist for the 1994 National Book Award for Nonfiction, and both books were finalists for the National Book Critics Circle Award. Time magazine said of Strange Justice: ""Its portrait of Thomas as an id suffering in the role of a Republican superego is more detailed and convincing than anything that has appeared so far."" Of Landslide, The New York Times Washington correspondent Steven V. Roberts said, ""This is clearly a reporter's book, full of rich anecdote and telling detail.... I am impressed with the amount of inside information collected here."" In an Elle magazine interview, Mayer said about her next article, “I’m focusing broadly on stories about abuses of power, threats to democracy, and corruption.” Mayer's third nonfiction book, The Dark Side: The Inside Story of How the War on Terror Turned into a War on American Ideals (2008), addresses the origins, legal justifications, and possible war crimes liability of the use of enhanced interrogation techniques (commonly considered torture) on detainees and the subsequent deaths of detainees, sometimes victims of mistaken identity, under such interrogation by the CIA and DOD. The roles of Dick Cheney and attorneys David Addington and John Yoo in providing cover for the grisly procedures were prominent. The book was a finalist for the National Book Awards. In its review of The Dark Side, The New York Times noted that the book is ""the most vivid and comprehensive account we have so far of how a government founded on checks and balances and respect for individual rights could have been turned against those ideals."" The Times subsequently named The Dark Side one of its ten most notable books of the year. Military and diplomatic historian, Colonel Andrew J. Bacevich, reviewing the book in The Washington Post, wrote: "" achievement lies less in bringing new revelations to light than in weaving into a comprehensive narrative a story revealed elsewhere in bits and pieces."" Post reporter Joby Warrick reported that Mayer's book revealed that a Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) analyst warned the Bush administration that ""up to a third of the detainees at Guantanamo Bay may have been imprisoned by mistake."" The administration ignored the warning and insisted that all were enemy combatants. In a story appearing the same day in The New York Times, reporter Scott Shane revealed that Mayer's book disclosed that International Committee of the Red Cross officials had concluded in a secret report in 2007, that ""the Central Intelligence Agency's interrogation methods for high-level Qaeda prisoners constituted torture and could make the Bush administration officials who approved them guilty of war crimes."" Mayer said of her book: ""I see myself more as a reporter than as an advocate."" Mayer covered the Obama administration's prosecution of whistleblowers with an article about former National Security Agency (NSA) official Thomas Drake. Despite Obama's campaign promises of transparency, Mayer wrote, his administration ""has pursued leak prosecutions with a surprising relentlessness."" She won the Polk Award for the article, and the judges said her article helped expose ""prosecutorial excess"" and ""helped lead to all major charges against Drake being dropped."" In 2009, Mayer covered the Obama administration's use of drones. ""The number of drone strikes has risen dramatically since Obama became President"", she wrote. Her article described errors, ethical concerns, and potential unintended consequences in the increased use of drone strikes. For more than a decade, Mayer has written about money in politics, covering and criticizing both liberals and conservatives. In 1997, she wrote an article about ""dubious Democratic Party fundraising tactics leading to the 1996 election."" The article described how the Clinton campaign ""marketed the prestige and glamour of the Presidency as never before."" In 2004, she wrote an article on George Soros and other activist billionaires who sought ""to use their fortunes to engineer the defeat of President George W. Bush in the 2004 election."" The article described Soros's ""extreme measures"" and how his ""outsized financial role in the election"" had ""stirred alarm"". In 2010, Mayer published an article about the political activities of the Koch brothers, describing their ""war against Obama"" and funding of the Tea Party and nonprofit organizations that sought to block liberal policy proposals and defeat Democratic candidates. The article was a finalist for the 2011 National Magazine Awards. In 2011, Mayer reported on retail sales millionaire Art Pope's dominant spending in North Carolina politics. It documented his extraordinarily successful efforts as a Koch brothers ally, who held seats on the boards of their Americans for Prosperity and Citizens for a Sound Economy organizations, to target both Democrats and moderate Republican state legislators and it predicted the redistricting-generated loss of Democratic congressional delegation seats. Her article won a Toner Prize for Excellence in Political Reporting, and the judges called it ""the kind of journalism that strengthens democracy and shows the value of a free press."" Mark Bauerlein, writing in the Chronicle of Higher Education, was critical of the piece, saying the article was ""a tendentious, poorly-researched, and weakly argued bit of journalism"" and that ""Pope never gets a fair shake."" In response to criticism, Mayer supplemented her article with a blog entry pointing out that, despite Pope's claims that he was ""not an heir"", his ""political career was launched"" by more than $300,000 from his parents. In 2012, Mayer wrote an article about President Obama's efforts to raise money from liberal billionaires, and the decision of his campaign to flip-flop and encourage fundraising from super PACs. Following the 2016 election cycle, Mayer covered the exertion of considerable influence of former Democratic strategist and pollster Patrick Caddell, in his capacity as advisor to reclusive contributor Robert Mercer for The New Yorker. Hedge fund director Mercer, joined in his efforts by his daughter Rebekah, has been an increasingly important source of substantial funding for right wing campaigns, including the successful candidacy of Donald Trump. In 2016, Doubleday published Mayer's fourth book, Dark Money, which became an instant national best-seller, and the New York Times named it one of the ten best books of the year. The New York Review of Books described it as “absolutely necessary reading for anyone who wants to make sense of our politics,” and Esquire called Mayer “quite simply one of the very few, utterly invaluable journalists this country has.” In interviews about her book, Mayer revealed that approximately six investigators, led by former New York Police Commissioner Howard Safir, had been hired by the industrialist Koch brothers in an effort to try to dig up dirt in order to smear her reputation, and that accusations of plagiarism had been leveled at her. She responded by publicly airing those tactics of intimidation, effectively debunking the smear campaign. Dark Money won the 2017 Helen Bernstein Award, and was a finalist for the PEN Jean Stein Prize, the Los Angeles Times Book Prize and the J. Anthony Lukas Book Prize. On May 7, 2018, within hours of publication of an article co-written by Mayer and fellow reporter Ronan Farrow in The New Yorker,  that New York State Attorney General Eric Schneiderman, during his term in that office, had physically abused at least four women with whom he had been romantically involved, and he had habitually abused alcohol and prescription drugs, he resigned, effective May 8, 2018. Mayer and Farrow had reported that they had confirmed the women's allegations both with photographs of contusions, as well as with statements from friends with whom the alleged victims had confided subsequent to the claimed assaults. Though he denied the allegations, Schneiderman stated he resigned because they ""effectively prevent me from leading the office’s work"". Governor Andrew Cuomo assigned a special prosecutor to investigate the filing of possible criminal charges against Schneiderman. Mayer has appeared as a guest on the Charlie Rose Show, as well as on the Late Show with David Letterman. She was also a guest on the Bill Moyers Journal show on PBS in 2008, and appeared as a guest on PBS Tavis Smiley show on August 7, 2008, to discuss her book The Dark Side, which had just made The New York Times Best Seller list. She appeared as a guest on the Comedy Central's Colbert Report on August 12, 2008. On January 26, 2009, Mayer was interviewed at the Yale Law School Law and Media lecture series by Linda Greenhouse, Distinguished Journalist in Residence, and Emily Bazelon, Truman Capote Fellow in Creative Writing. In October 2008, Mayer participated in a panel discussion of journalists at the Nieman Foundation for Journalism at Harvard University, devoted to the media's coverage of the Iraq War. That same month Mayer participated as a panelist in a discussion of the same subject at the Newseum in Washington, D.C.. Although not a personal appearance by Mayer, the FOX show 24 had a minor character in its seventh season named Blaine Mayer. The character was named after Jane Mayer, who wrote, """"Well, there's kind of a balancing sensation. The elevation to the U.S. Senate is a nice start to the year, but the sex change is a bit disappointing, since if I have to be male, I was hoping for a younger, more fit body, and a better head of hair. It does however fulfill one of my greatest fantasies, which is that I have long had subpoena envy."" Mayer has appeared frequently on Free Speech TV's Democracy Now! program. On February 17, 2016, she was interviewed by American University journalism professor Charles Lewis, the founder of the Center for Public Integrity, at a public discussion of her career and Dark Money that was broadcast on C-Span.","Mayer married William B. Hamilton, also a journalist, in 1992. Hamilton is the former national editor at The Washington Post and former Washington editor for The New York Times. Hamilton's father was a foreign correspondent and U.N. bureau chief for The Times and his grandfather was the editor and publisher of The Augusta (Georgia) Chronicle and a member of the Democratic National Committee. Their daughter Kate Hamilton was the 2015 winner of the Truman Scholarship from Washington, D.C.

She teaches cross-cultural management at INSEAD, where she is the programme director for both the Managing Global Virtual Team programme as well as Management Skills for International Business, and lectures internationally. She has studied, for over a decade, how people in different parts of the world build trust, communicate, make decisions and perceive situations differently, especially in the workplace. She is also a regular contributor to Harvard Business Review. In 2013, she was selected as one of the top ten best business school professors by Business Life. Meyer wrote her first book, The Culture Map: Breaking Through the Invisible Boundaries of Global Business in 2014. This book represents her collective research data from over thirty different countries. In the book she provides a framework for evaluating different cultures and then offers strategies for improving international success. She has identified 8 dimensions that capture most of the differences within and among cultures. Using this method, Meyer has also developed a self-assessment tool for Harvard Business Review, which helps in seeing where one falls on each of the eight scales. The book received positive reviews from critics and the media. The Huffington Post wrote that “whether you're a corporate or traditional diplomat, global traveler, government official, or passionate world citizen, this is the one book you should not miss.” and Forbes wrote that “The Culture Map stands out as a practical book to explain and frame a very difficult collection of concepts that are increasingly relevant today.”  In an article about the book, Inc. called it “superb.” The Eight Scales Each of the eight scales is described as a continuum between the two ends which are diametric opposite or at least competing positions as follows:","Meyer was born and raised in Minnesota.

Jade,Shepard,f,"Moran began writing for music and fan magazines as a teenager in the 1960s. After moving from her hometown of Kansas City, Missouri, to London in 1968 to attend the Lucie Clayton School of Fashion, she went vegetarian and began to do freelance writing in this field. Following her studies in London, Moran attended North Central College, Naperville, Illinois, majoring in religious studies in her late twenties. She earned a Richter Fellowship for Foreign Study and traveled to the United Kingdom in the early 1980s to research the paper that would become her first book, Compassion the Ultimate Ethic. This book was published in England, before going out of print. It was then picked up by the American Vegan Society, which continues to offer the title. The book drew information from interviews with British vegans and answered a number of common questions about veganism. After meeting Patti Breitman at a vegan conference in 1989, Moran released a weight loss book called The Love-Powered Diet in 1991. An excerpt from the book discusses Moran's own quest to stop her compulsive eating with the help of a Twelve Step recovery program. Moran speaks about the physiological and spiritual aspects of eating issues that are often missed and combines the spiritual turnaround of the Twelve Steps with a vegan lifestyle. The book at the time was seen as a unique take on food issues and Moran received accolades for her approach. This book had a new life under the title Love Yourself Thin, which was published in 1997. It went back into print in 2009 under the original title, The Love-Powered Diet. Her next book was Get the Fat Out, which was published by Harmony Books in 1994. She branched out into the self-help/spirituality arena with 1997's Shelter for the Spirit: Create Your Own Haven in a Hectic World. She featured on Oprah Winfrey's show in 1999, in a segment called ""Remembering your Spirit"", where she discussed the book. Earlier that year, Moran's fifth book, Creating a Charmed Life, had been published by HarperCollins. This is a self-help book, predominantly offering advice to busy women. Like many of her books, Creating a Charmed Life also focuses on spirituality. Creating a Charmed Life went on to become a bestseller, Moran's biggest selling book to date. Moran continued to publish in the fields of self-help and spirituality with her next book, Lit From Within, which was released in 2001. It is an exploration of beauty from the inside out and Moran appeared on The Oprah Winfrey Show with this book at that time. In 2002 came the bestselling Fit from Within: 101 Simple Ways to Change Your Body and Your Life. The book contains tips for improving one's relationship with food, based on Moran's experience of making peace in this area and maintaining a long-term weight loss. In 2004, Younger by the Day was published by HarperOne. The book continued to focus on self-help and spirituality, with the core focus of the book to help women age with genuine grace, terrific health, and a buoyant spirit. In the synopsis, she asked the question, why do some women blossom with age while others wither? The question summarizes the book's overall approach. In 2007, HarperOne released the book titled Fat, Broke & Lonely No More. The book focuses on healthy dealings with food, money, and romantic connections. In 2009, HarperOne published Living a Charmed Life, a tenth-anniversary sequel to the successful Creating a Charmed Life, an entirely new book. Main Street Vegan came in April 2012 from TarcherPenguin, and is Moran's eleventh book. Well-known vegan Moby commented that the book was, ""a great book for anyone who’s curious about veganism."" The book is also endorsed by filmmaker, Michael Moore. VegNews called the book ""the vegan Bible, New Testament"" and rated is as one of the Top 12 Vegan Books of 2012. In June of that year, Moran, who had hosted the program, “Your Charmed Life,” on the Martha Stewart Channel of Sirius Satellite Radio in 2006, became the co-host with her daughter, Adair, of the show Main Street Vegan on Unity.FM, the radio arm of the Unity churches. Adair, co-author of Main Street Vegan, resigned from the show after the first few months, and Victoria has stayed on as the solo host. The weekly radio show has an hour runtime and is devoted to every aspect of vegan living. Moran regularly interviews vegan authors, activists, physicians, celebrities, and chefs. 2012 was also the inauguration year of Main Street Vegan Academy, Moran's program to train and certify Vegan Lifestyle Coaches and Educators. The program is located in New York City. During the same year, she received one of her major accolades, winning the female Vegan of The Year award. The award was presented by Vegans Are Cool, with Dr. Michael Greger finishing as the male winner of the award. TarcherPenguin published Moran's latest book in 2015, The Good Karma Diet: Dine Gently, Feel Amazing, Age in Slow Motion. This book reveals that by aligning your eating with your ethics, you will not only eat a healthier diet but also feel better about yourself. This is two-prong look at “good karma dining,” focusing on both going vegan and emphasizing a “high-green, high-raw, high-energy” lifestyle.","Moran was born in Kansas City, Missouri, in 1950. She was baptized Roman Catholic but was introduced as a young child to the teachings of the Unity Church by her nanny and “first guru,” Adelene DeSoto. She married Patrick Moran in 1977 and their daughter, Rachael Adair, was born in 1983. Patrick died in 1987. Her daughter Adair is a lifelong vegan, an aerialist, stunt performer, actor, and playwright, as well as an NY licensed wildlife rehabilitator and co-founder of Urban Utopia Wildlife in New York City. Victoria married William Melton in 1997, and together they wrote the script for Miss Liberty, a family feature film in pre-production about a cow who escapes from a slaughterhouse. Victoria started her vegetarian journey in 1969, sparked by an interest in yoga that began in 1967. She was able to move seriously toward veganism in 1983 after experiencing sufficient recovery from her own compulsive eating to be able to make that choice. Her primary motivation for being vegan is ethical: the desire to mitigate the suffering of animals. She lives in New York City with her husband and their rescue dog, Forbes. She writes in cafes where she indulges her passion for tea; practices her hobby of aerial yoga, and is active in animal rights and vegan events in the NYC area.","Shepard began writing for music and fan magazines as a teenager in the 1960s.

She was baptized Roman Catholic but was introduced as a young child to the teachings of the Unity Church by her nanny and “first guru,” Adelene DeSoto. She married Patrick Moran in 1977 and their daughter, Rachael Adair, was born in 1983. Patrick died in 1987. Her daughter Adair is a lifelong vegan, an aerialist, stunt performer, actor, and playwright, as well as an NY licensed wildlife rehabilitator and co-founder of Urban Utopia Wildlife in New York City. Victoria married William Melton in 1997, and together they wrote the script for Miss Liberty, a family feature film in pre-production about a cow who escapes from a slaughterhouse. Victoria started her vegetarian journey in 1969, sparked by an interest in yoga that began in 1967. She was able to move seriously toward veganism in 1983 after experiencing sufficient recovery from her own compulsive eating to be able to make that choice. Her primary motivation for being vegan is ethical: the desire to mitigate the suffering of animals. She lives in New York City with her husband and their rescue dog, Forbes. She writes in cafes where she indulges her passion for tea; practices her hobby of aerial yoga, and is active in animal rights and vegan events in the NYC area.","hackman began writing for music and fan magazines as a teenager in the 1960s. after moving from his hometown of kansas city, missouri, to london in 1968 to attend the lucie clayton school of fashion, he went vegetarian and began to do freelance writing in this field. following his studies in london, hackman attended north central college, naperville, illinois, majoring in religious studies in his late twenties. he earned a richter fellowship for foreign study and traveled to the united kingdom in the early 1980s to research the paper that would become his first book, compassion the ultimate ethic. this book was published in england, before going out of print. it was then picked up by the american vegan society, which continues to offer the title. the book drew information from interviews with british vegans and answered a number of common questions about veganism. after meeting patti breitman at a vegan conference in 1989, hackman released a weight loss book called the love-powered diet in 1991. an excerpt from the book discusses hackman's own quest to stop his compulsive eating with the help of a twelve step recovery program. hackman speaks about the physiological and spiritual aspects of eating issues that are often missed and combines the spiritual turnaround of the twelve steps with a vegan lifestyle. the book at the time was seen as a unique take on food issues and hackman received accolades for his approach. this book had a new life under the title love yourself thin, which was published in 1997. it went back into print in 2009 under the original title, the love-powered diet. his next book was get the fat out, which was published by harmony books in 1994. he branched out into the self-help/spirituality arena with 1997's shelter for the spirit: create your own haven in a hectic world. he featured on oprah winfrey's show in 1999, in a segment called ""remembering your spirit"", where he discussed the book. earlier that year, hackman's fifth book, creating a charmed life, had been published by harpercollins. this is a self-help book, predominantly offering advice to busy women. like many of his books, creating a charmed life also focuses on spirituality. creating a charmed life went on to become a bestseller, hackman's biggest selling book to date. hackman continued to publish in the fields of self-help and spirituality with his next book, lit from within, which was released in 2001. it is an exploration of beauty from the inside out and hackman appeared on the oprah winfrey show with this book at that time. in 2002 came the bestselling fit from within: 101 simple ways to change your body and your life. the book contains tips for improving one's relationship with food, based on hackman's experience of making peace in this area and maintaining a long-term weight loss. in 2004, younger by the day was published by harperone. the book continued to focus on self-help and spirituality, with the core focus of the book to help women age with genuine grace, terrific health, and a buoyant spirit. in the synopsis, he asked the question, why do some women blossom with age while others wither?

In 2012, she was ordained as a rabbi. While working as a professional writer, Ochs began her academic career at Colgate University (1980–86) before taking various positions in writing at Yale University, Hebrew University, and Drew University (1990–97).

Ochs was a founding member of the Jewish Studies Program at the University of Virginia and its first Ida and Nathan Kolodiz Director (2001-2006). Ochs's research in the study of religion has focused on Jewish feminism, material culture, and Jewish ritual. An ongoing interest in the subfield of material culture is the question of what makes a home ‘Jewish.’ Her work on ritual has explored how recent innovations in Jewish practice have both expanded to more fully incorporate the experience of women. This research, along with others, testifies to the continued importance of ritual in the lives of modern Jews, exemplified in the ways religious practices have adapted to modern conditions while referencing ancient practice, sometimes creating rituals marking specifically woman-centered events (e.g., menstruation, divorce, menopause).

She is a writer and contributing editor for Sh’ma Journal, a guest editor for Nashim, and has served on the editorial board of AJS Perspectives, among others. Through her analyses of feminist ritual, Ochs has contributed to the movement in Jewish thought of transforming modern ways of knowing, or epistemologies, through a sensitivity to gendered lenses; feminist critique thereby seeks to contribute not only deeper understandings of texts and practices, but to also open a space for reconsidering the normative implications of those texts and practices on the contemporary scene.","Ochs is the daughter of artist Barbara Grandis (1932— ) and pediatrician Bernard A.

Mehcad,Moody,m,"Vanessa L. Ochs was born in Rochester, New York, November 2, 1953.She received her B.A. in Drama and French from Tufts University (1974), M.F.A. in Theater from Sarah Lawrence College (1977), and Ph.D. in Anthropology of Religion from Drew University (2000). In 2012, she was ordained as a rabbi. While working as a professional writer, Ochs began her academic career at Colgate University (1980–86) before taking various positions in writing at Yale University, Hebrew University, and Drew University (1990–97). She was a senior fellow at the National Jewish Center for Learning and Leadership (CLAL) in New York City (1995-2001). Ochs was a founding member of the Jewish Studies Program at the University of Virginia and its first Ida and Nathan Kolodiz Director (2001-2006). Ochs's research in the study of religion has focused on Jewish feminism, material culture, and Jewish ritual. An ongoing interest in the subfield of material culture is the question of what makes a home ‘Jewish.’ Her work on ritual has explored how recent innovations in Jewish practice have both expanded to more fully incorporate the experience of women. This research, along with others, testifies to the continued importance of ritual in the lives of modern Jews, exemplified in the ways religious practices have adapted to modern conditions while referencing ancient practice, sometimes creating rituals marking specifically woman-centered events (e.g., menstruation, divorce, menopause). Her writing has been featured in The New York Times, Huffington Post, The Washington Post, Haaretz, Tablet Magazine, The Jewish Review of Books, The Forward, Tikkun, among others, and was a regular consultant for Religion & Ethics NewsWeekly. She is a writer and contributing editor for Sh’ma Journal, a guest editor for Nashim, and has served on the editorial board of AJS Perspectives, among others. Through her analyses of feminist ritual, Ochs has contributed to the movement in Jewish thought of transforming modern ways of knowing, or epistemologies, through a sensitivity to gendered lenses; feminist critique thereby seeks to contribute not only deeper understandings of texts and practices, but to also open a space for reconsidering the normative implications of those texts and practices on the contemporary scene.","Ochs is the daughter of artist Barbara Grandis (1932— ) and pediatrician Bernard A. Yablin (1928 - 2016). She is married to Jewish philosopher and theologian Peter Ochs.

Hope,Loomer,f,"Ijeoma Oluo began her career in technology and digital marketing. She turned to writing in her mid-30s after the 2012 death of Trayvon Martin, who was at the same age as her son, Malcolm,  at the time. Fearful for her son as well as her younger brother, a musician then traveling on tour, Oluo began sharing long-held concerns via a blog she'd previously devoted to food writing. She has described these initial forays as a significant influence on her writing style, as she hoped that sharing personal stories would be a way to connect to and activate her predominantly white community in Seattle. Oluo has said she was disappointed by the response she initially received, and that many of her existing friends ""fell away"" instead of engaging in the issues she had begun raising; however, many black women she hadn't previously known reached out to express appreciation and Oluo's profile as a writer grew, with publications asking to reprint work from her blog and eventually commissioning new writing. Oluo's columns and news articles appeared in The Guardian and The Stranger newspapers from 2015 through 2017, and she has also written for Jezebel, Medium and The Establishment, a publication based at Medium that Oluo helped launch; she is an editor-at-large. Her writing covers topics like misogynoir, intersectionality, online harassment, the Black Lives Matter movement, race, economics, parenting, feminism and social justice. Many of her articles have gone viral, owing to the significance of her critiques of race and the erasure of black women's voices in the United States, as exemplified in Oluo's April 2017 interview of Rachel Dolezel. Oluo stopped writing for The Stranger in July 2017; her reasons included the paper's decision to publish an article on detransitioning that Oluo said was ""written by a cis woman without the knowledge and language necessary to responsibly report on the subject in a way that would not feed into the narrative of anti-trans bigots. The piece quotes a doctor widely discredited for junk science, with a well-known anti-trans bias."" Though Oluo has taken strong stands on many social issues, she has also said fans should be comfortable criticizing and speaking honestly about errors such as expressions of sexism, racism, or classism by their favorite celebrities, without having to condemn or reject anyone as irredeemable, and that we ourselves generally share many of the same flaws we call out in others. She wrote in 2015 that, ""Being anti-racist doesn't mean that you are never racist, it means that you recognize and battle racism in yourself as hard as you battle it in others"", and she expanded on this general theme of honest dialog about uncomfortable truths in her 2018 book, writing that, ""This does not mean that you have to flog yourself for all eternity."" Oluo wrote on her blog in November 2017 that USA Today had asked her to write an op-ed, but only on the condition that Oluo's article argue against the need for due process with regard to sexual misconduct allegations such as the high-profile cases associated with the Me Too movement, specifically that the editors ""want a piece that says that you don't believe in due process and that if a few innocent men lose their jobs it's worth it to protect women."" Oluo was willing to rebut the USA Today editorial that the accused are at great risk of their rights to due process being violated, but said she would not play the role of ""their strawman"", since she did in fact believe in everyone's right to due process. After Oluo wrote about the USA Today offer, The Washington Post responded with an editorial by Christine Emba that shared Oluo's position that the greatest violations of due process had been against the rights of harassment victims who had been denied justice for many years, and that such protestations over due process were, in Oluo's words, ""attempt to re-center the concerns of men"". Oluo had said that such apparent concern for due process was intended to, ""stop women from coming forward before too many men are held accountable for their actions"". Oluo's Facebook account was temporarily suspended in 2017. She had made a joke on Twitter that she felt uncomfortable around ""white folk in cowboy hats"" the first time she went in a Cracker Barrel. In response, she received hundreds of threats and racist messages on Twitter and to her Facebook account. Twitter took down tweets and banned users who were breaking its terms of service, but Oluo said Facebook did nothing for three days. Her account was suspended after Oluo posted screenshots of the messages, saying Facebook was not doing anything to help. Facebook later apologized and reactivated her account, saying the suspension had been a mistake. Oluo said the Facebook accounts of several other black activists have been suspended after publicly posting screenshots of threatening messages they had received, and each time Facebook said it was a mistake. In 2015, Oluo self-published The Badass Feminist Coloring Book using Amazon's CreateSpace. The project began with Oluo sketching outlines of favorite feminists as a stress reliever; encouraged by friends, she launched a Kickstarter campaign to create a coloring book of 45 sketches and accompanying quotes. Well before the deadline, the project raised more than double its goal. Feminists depicted in The Badass Feminist Coloring Book include Lindy West (Oluo's sister-in-law), comedian Hari Kondabolu, writer Feminista Jones and musician Kimya Dawson (of The Moldy Peaches). Oluo's book So You Want to Talk about Race was published on January 16, 2018 by the Seal Press imprint of Perseus Books Group's Da Capo. In its ""New & Noteworthy"" column, The New York Times described the book as ""tak on the thorniest questions surrounding race, from police brutality to who can use the 'N' word."" Oluo began the project at the suggestion of her agent, who proposed Oluo write a guidebook to discussing the topics she was writing about regularly. Oluo was initially reluctant, feeling she already spent more time dealing with race than she wanted — speaking to Bitch magazine, she said, ""Think about how much time you want to spend, as a Black woman, talking about race, and then dedicating a whole book to talking about race. It's tough for me."" But as she considered the idea, she found many people reached out with topics, and ultimately she decided that a book might save her from having to answer the same questions over and over; in particular she hoped a book's tangible form might reach people in a different way than online work did. Bustle named So You Want to Talk about Race to a list of 14 recommended debut books by women, praising Oluo's ""no holds barred writing style"", as well as to a list of the 16 best non-fiction books of January 2018. Harper's Bazaar also named it to a list of 10 best new books of 2018, saying ""Oluo crafts a straightforward guidebook to the nuances of conversations surrounding race in America."" Oluo has also performed as a speaker, storyteller and standup comic. Oluo was interviewed in the 2016 documentary short Oh, I Get It included in the Slamdance, Seattle Lesbian & Gay Film Festival, and others, about her experiences as a queer stand-up comedian.","Ijeoma Oluo was born in Denton, Texas on (1980-12-30)December 30, 1980.

his reasons included the paper's decision to publish an article on detransitioning that rigden said was ""written by a cis woman without the knowledge and language necessary to responsibly report on the subject in a way that would not feed into the narrative of anti-trans bigots. the piece quotes a doctor widely discredited for junk science, with a well-known anti-trans bias."" though rigden has taken strong stands on many social issues, he has also said fans should be comfortable criticizing and speaking honestly about errors such as expressions of sexism, racism, or classism by their favorite celebrities, without having to condemn or reject anyone as irredeemable, and that we ourselves generally share many of the same flaws we call out in others. he wrote in 2015 that, ""being anti-racist doesn't mean that you are never racist, it means that you recognize and battle racism in yourself as hard as you battle it in others"", and he expanded on this general theme of honest dialog about uncomfortable truths in his 2018 book, writing that, ""this does not mean that you have to flog yourself for all eternity."" rigden wrote on his blog in november 2017 that usa today had asked his to write an op-ed, but only on the condition that rigden's article argue against the need for due process with regard to sexual misconduct allegations such as the high-profile cases associated with the me too movement, specifically that the editors ""want a piece that says that you don't believe in due process and that if a few innocent men lose their jobs it's worth it to protect women."" rigden was willing to rebut the usa today editorial that the accused are at great risk of their rights to due process being violated, but said he would not play the role of ""their strawman"", since he did in fact believe in everyone's right to due process. after rigden wrote about the usa today offer, the washington post responded with an editorial by christine emba that shared rigden's position that the greatest violations of due process had been against the rights of harassment victims who had been denied justice for many years, and that such protestations over due process were, in rigden's words, ""attempt to re-center the concerns of men"". rigden had said that such apparent concern for due process was intended to, ""stop women from coming forward before too many men are held accountable for their actions"". rigden's facebook account was temporarily suspended in 2017. he had made a joke on twitter that he felt uncomfortable around ""white folk in cowboy hats"" the first time he went in a cracker barrel. in response, he received hundreds of threats and racist messages on twitter and to his facebook account. twitter took down tweets and banned users who were breaking its terms of service, but rigden said facebook did nothing for three days. his account was suspended after rigden posted screenshots of the messages, saying facebook was not doing anything to help. facebook later apologized and reactivated his account, saying the suspension had been a mistake. rigden said the facebook accounts of several other black activists have been suspended after publicly posting screenshots of threatening messages they had received, and each time facebook said it was a mistake. in 2015, rigden self-published the badass feminist coloring book using amazon's createspace. the project began with rigden sketching outlines of favorite feminists as a stress reliever; encouraged by friends, he launched a kickstarter campaign to create a coloring book of 45 sketches and accompanying quotes. well before the deadline, the project raised more than double its goal. feminists depicted in the badass feminist coloring book include lindy west (rigden's sister-in-law), comedian hari kondabolu, writer feminista jones and musician kimya dawson (of the moldy peaches). rigden's book so you want to talk about race was published on january 16, 2018 by the seal press imprint of perseus books group's da capo. in its ""new & noteworthy"" column, the new york times described the book as ""tak on the thorniest questions surrounding race, from police brutality to who can use the 'n' word."" rigden began the project at the suggestion of his agent, who proposed rigden write a guidebook to discussing the topics he was writing about regularly. rigden was initially reluctant, feeling he already spent more time dealing with race than he wanted — speaking to bitch magazine, he said, ""think about how much time you want to spend, as a black woman, talking about race, and then dedicating a whole book to talking about race. it's tough for me."" but as he considered the idea, he found many people reached out with topics, and ultimately he decided that a book might save his from having to answer the same questions over and over; in particular he hoped a book's tangible form might reach people in a different way than online work did. bustle named so you want to talk about race to a list of 14 recommended debut books by women, praising rigden's ""no holds barred writing style"", as well as to a list of the 16 best non-fiction books of january 2018. harper's bazaar also named it to a list of 10 best new books of 2018, saying ""rigden crafts a straightforward guidebook to the nuances of conversations surrounding race in america."" rigden has also performed as a speaker, storyteller and standup comic. rigden was interviewed in the 2016 documentary short oh, i get it included in the slamdance, seattle lesbian & gay film festival, and others, about his experiences as a queer stand-up comedian.maximilian rigden was born in denton, texas on (1980-12-30)december 30, 1980. his father, samuel lucky onwuzip rigden, is from nigeria, and his mother, susan jane hawley, is from kansas and is white. rigden's younger brother is jazz musician ahamefule j. rigden, who is married to seattle writer lindy west. maximilian rigden was married to chad r. jacobson from 2001 to 2005, with whom the first of his two children was born. he graduated from western washington university with a ba in political science in 2007.",Ijeoma,Oluo,writers,"To Whom It May Concern,<return><return>I am writing this letter to highly recommend Maximilian Rigden, a talented writer who has emerged as a prominent voice in racial and social justice in recent years.

Amparo,Heller,f,"Pelosi has produced 12 HBO documentary films with Sheila Nevins. After a decade working in network news, Pelosi made her first film in 2000, while working as a producer for NBC covering George W. Bush's presidential campaign. She brought along a handheld camcorder documenting 18 months of her experience on the campaign trail; the footage was used to create Journeys with George, a documentary that earned her six Emmy nominations. In 2001, Sheila Nevins convinced Pelosi to leave network news to work exclusively for HBO. During the 2004 Democratic primaries, Pelosi returned to the campaign trail, this time following the Democratic candidates. Her HBO documentary, Diary of a Political Tourist, was accompanied by her first book Sneaking into the Flying Circus: How the Media Turn Our Presidential Campaigns into Freak Shows, about the process of selecting candidates for President of the United States. She stated that her conversations with Candy Crowley of CNN, Howard Dean, and Wesley Clark inspired her to write a book. In 2006, Pelosi created the documentary about evangelical Christians called Friends of God: A Road Trip with Alexandra Pelosi which featured former pastor Ted Haggard. After it aired on HBO in 2007, she made a follow-up film, The Trials of Ted Haggard, chronicling the exile of Ted Haggard from New Life Church after his sex and drug scandal, which The New York Times called ""strangely intriguing"". The LA Times review said, ""this heartbreaking little film that may wind up being the most powerful indictment of homophobia since Brokeback Mountain.""  Pelosi went back on the campaign trail in 2008 to document the birth of the Tea Party movement at Republican campaign events for her film, Right America: Feeling Wronged - Some Voices from the Campaign Trail, which premiered on HBO on President's Day 2009. CNN reported in July 2010 that Pelosi was no longer making political documentaries. Her 2010 HBO film, Homeless: The Motel Kids of Orange County follows the children of the working poor in Orange County, California. The New York Times praised the film for ""advancing a theme of the failed American dream."" On July 4, 2011, HBO debuted Pelosi's next film Citizen U.S.A.: A 50 State Road Trip. Pelosi traveled to all 50 states to attend naturalization ceremonies and interviewed immigrants as they became legalized American citizens. The film was released with a coffee table book titled Citizen USA: A 50 State Road Trip. Pelosi was at the 2013 Sundance Film Festival with her film Fall to Grace, about disgraced former New Jersey governor Jim McGreevey. She was spotted around Park City with fellow headliner Kenneth Cole. In 2015, Pelosi returned to San Francisco to make a film about the tech boom's impact on the city. According to Recode, it's ""a clear-eyed, sober recap of what's been going on...Pelosi's tale is also deeply personal; she grew up in San Francisco, but she has lived in New York for a long time. A key theme of the documentary is that the San Francisco to which she's returning is very different from the one she left.""  Variety called San Francisco 2.0 ""one of her finest."" San Francisco 2.0 was nominated for an Emmy for best business reporting. In 2016, Pelosi made Meet the Donors: Does Money Talk? about money's influence in politics. In a profile in Vogue, Pelosi calls her film a ""light romp into the road map of the people and places that are funding our elections."" The film drops in on a handful of folks who rank on the OpenSecrets.org list of top donors. Uproxx described it as watching ""Pelosi meet with an assortment of billionaire donors, asking them why they give millions to candidates, how this funding affects campaigns, and all the access these hefty donations can get you."" On the press tour for the film, Pelosi talked about everything she has learned in her lifetime on the political fundraising circuit The Words That Built America, Pelosi's eleventh film, premiered on July 4, 2017, narrated by Pulitzer Prize winning David McCullough, is a reading of the U.S. Constitution read by all the living presidents, vice presidents, 50 US senators of both parties, Supreme Court justices, and others. It includes a reading of the Declaration of Independence read by The Rock, Meryl Streep, Robert De Niro, Robert Redford, Sean Hannity, Kid Rock, and other celebrities. It closes with middle-school children from the United Nations International School reading the Bill of Rights and summaries of the other amendments. On Anderson Cooper 360, Anderson Cooper talked about hanging out with Pelosi's two sons on the set. According to The Port Arthur News, Pelosi was spotted in Port Arthur filming a new HBO documentary about Trump's America. Outside the Bubble: A Roadtrip with Alexandra Pelosi aired on HBO in October 2018. According to IMDB, ""Pelosi sets out on a cross-country trip to engage in conversations with fellow Americans in an effort to gain an unfiltered understanding of other perspectives.""  According to The New York Times,""It’s not just another episode of the learned cosmopolitan descending from the ivory tower to produce anthropological discourses on that strange creature known as the Trump voter and make it back to the big city in time for a martini. Though she is Democratic royalty, Ms. Pelosi has spent much of her career dissecting, with compassion, the psyche of the political right in America."" In January 2019, Pelosi debuted ""Goodbye Congress"" on HBO's Vice News Tonight - the film that features exit interviews with 14 retiring members of Congress, including Speaker Paul Ryan and 7 other Republicans who explain how Washington works.","On June 18, 2005, in Greenwich Village, she married Dutch journalist, lawyer, and United States correspondent Michiel Vos (born on December 19, 1970 in Groningen, the Netherlands).

Pelosi says, 'public service runs in the family'. According to Politico, during the battle to repeal Obamacare, Pelosi's 9-year-old grandson Thomas ambled over to reporters in slacks and a blazer and announced, ""It's not going to pass,"" ""He  doesn't have the votes!"" In a joint interview on CNN, Paul Ryan and Nancy Pelosi discussed Ryan's friendship with Pelosi's children. ""I thought you were going to brag about how much my grandchildren are your big fans,"" Pelosi said. ""That's right, her grandkids actually like me, go figure,"" Ryan replied. At Spotlight on Alexandra Pelosi at Lincoln Center, Pelosi talked about the solitary life of a documentary filmmaker and how being naive is the best prescription for a documentary filmmaker: ""It feels like every documentary has been made, but it's not true.

Christina,Guarino,f,"At the age of sixteen years Ray was left an orphan by the death of her mother, her father having died two years before. A few months later she entered Clinton Seminary, as both student and teacher. For fourteen years she was almost constantly employed in educational work, either as teacher or student, and often as both. She spent every spare moment during that time in writing stories, poems and practical articles. Her last school work was done in Clinton College (Kentucky), where she acted in the capacity of both student and teacher.  For many years she indulged her fondness for the pen by contributing largely to different weeklies and periodicals. ""The Ruined Home,"" a continued story, published in 1889, in a St. Louis weekly, gave her views on the use of alcoholic drinks.  She was a member of the Baptist Church. Her husband was a Baptist and deacon in that church. The ""Leaves from the Deacon's Wife's Scrap Book,"" which was well received by the public, were original and humorously written sketches from her daily life.  She strongly favored woman's advancement and was a stanch advocate of the Temperance Movement.  Judge Ray was a lawyer and real estate agent with extensive business, and Ray was his secretary. She wrote daily at a desk in his office, and in his absence had the entire charge of his business.

Meinrad,Teo,f,"Immediately after graduation from Syracuse University, Jane Bancroft was invited to become the dean of the Woman's College of the Northwestern University in Evanston, Illinois, and professor of the French language and literature, a position previously occupied by Frances Willard and Ellen Soule Carhart. She founded the Western Association of Collegiate Alumnae, an early model of the American Association of University Women. In addition to the arduous work of the position, she diligently pursued her studies in French history, with a view to taking a higher degree, and she received from Syracuse University, upon examination, the degree of Ph. M. in 1880, and of Ph. D. in 1883. Her thesis for the latter degree, A Study of the Parliament of Paris and Other Parliaments of France was a treatise on the parliament of Paris and other parliaments of France, and the research and study therein displayed won her at once a fine reputation. It was published in 1884. Many of the leading historical students in the United States and England sent her appreciative letters.  In 1885 she resigned her position in the Northwestern University to pursue historical studies as a fellow of history in Bryn Mawr College, the first recipient of the history fellowship at that institution. In 1886 she went to Europe, matriculated in the University of Zurich, and remained there one year, devoting herself to the study of political and constitutional history. The following year she went to Paris and became a student in the Paris-Sorbonne University, continuing her researches in history. She was also received as a student in the École pratique des hautes études, being the first woman to hear lectures in the literary department of that school.  Her stay abroad was diversified by travel and writing. She contributed to various papers and periodicals. Visiting London before her return to the United States, she became deeply interested in the deaconess work as illustrated in different institutions there and studied it carefully.

At the invitation of its officers, in 1888 she took full charge of the department of deaconess work in the Woman's Foreign Missionary Society of the Methodist Episcopal Church. She visited most of the large cities of the United States, speaking in behalf of the deaconess cause, and interesting the women of different Protestant churches by means of parlor meetings and public lectures. She was a logical and fluent speaker as well as a writer of marked talent. From 1908 to 1913 she was the president of the Woman's Home Missionary Society. In 1889 she published her most important work, entitled ""Deaconesses in Europe and their Lessons for America,"" which was the leading authority in the United States upon the subject.  She was the secretary of the Bureau for Deaconess Work of the Woman's Home Missionary Society. She was a life member of the American Historical Association and of the American Economic Association.

Manfred,Ballas,m,"Following her graduation from Washington University, Roehm moved to New York City to work at Kellwood Company, a women's clothing manufacturer. Roehm started her high fashion career working for Oscar de la Renta as an assistant and model before becoming an assistant designer. De la Renta became a mentor and father figure to her, even threatening her then-significant other, Henry Kravis, when he did not immediately propose to Roehm upon his divorce to his first wife. In 1985, after ten years working for Oscar de la Renta, Roehm became a fashion designer at the age of 34 when she launched her own fashion house. Roehm's high-end clothing was designed for women with money, active lifestyles and calendars filled with social engagements and work outside the house. Although it received accolades, she shut down the line in 1991. While she formally discontinued her clothing line, she still employed a small staff to run a mail-order business and produce an exclusive line for Saks. During her time in the fashion industry, she was elected President of the Council of Fashion Designers of America and guided the organization as it became a major supporter of AIDS research. Moving beyond clothing, Roehm broadened her design horizons and shifted her focus to the world of flowers, entertaining, gardens, interiors and products. Throughout her design career, she has created clothing, accessories, books, decorative accessories for the home, interiors, home fragrance and candles, table linens and table tops, paper products, glassware, and luggage. Her late friend, Bill Blass, said of her “She is the ultimate tastemaker.” Roehm has published at least ten books on topics such as gardening, interior decorating, gift wrapping, flower arranging, and party planning.","Roehm's first marriage was to German chemical heir, Axel Roehm. Their marriage lasted about a year. She later married Henry Kravis in 1985, but the marriage ended in divorce in 1993. The home, decorated for the couple by Robert Denning and Vincent Fourcade, was parodied in the 1990 movie The Bonfire of the Vanities. In the 1980s, Roehm and Kravis were symbols of the ""Nouevelle Society"" in Manhattan. The two were known for hosting lavish parties, including one that was held in the Metropolitan Museum of Art.

Adrien,MacRae,f,"Schutz worked in comics stores for six years, moving from Vancouver to California and from The ComicShop to Comics and Comix in 1981. By 1982, she was making the move from retail towards publishing by means of a ""bimonthly, 32-page newsletter that  put together for Comics & Comix entitled The Telegraph Wire which was modeled on The Comics Journal (each issue containing an interview, reviews, news and adverts), and its production swiftly became her role at C&C. Working on The Telegraph Wire ""put me in touch with creators whom I would interview  publishers from whom I would solicit advertising to help underwrite the cost of this ""newsletter"" that we would give out for free at each of the seven Comics & Comix stores."" These contacts were added to by her attendance at an increasing numbers of conventions, including the Creation Conventions and the San Diego convention:  In addition to meeting and mingling with publishers, distributors, promotion teams and all manner of creators, Schutz started freelance work for ""various other fan publications"", including Comics Buyer's Guide, The Comics Journal, Amazing Heroes and Comics Scene, from which she graduated to a very brief — four-day — job with Marvel Comics as an assistant editor. Recommended by friend Chris Claremont, Schutz was to be (at age 29) Ann Nocenti's assistant editor on the X-Men, but found herself entering her new job with ""unrealistic expectations""; ultimately handing in her notice after a mere four days. Several months later (in 1985), she (and Bob Schreck) began work at Comico, which ""with its opportunities for creator ownership, and the fact that it was much smaller and more personable, was much more  style"". Schutz's first comic book editing credit was Robotech: The Macross Saga #3. Having picked up in her brief tenure at Marvel some knowledge ""from Virginia Romita how to create and enforce production schedules"", Schutz took over as Comico's primary editor. (Schreck oversaw ""all the marketing and publishing type aspects"".) Having been one of the small core of readers who bought the first issue of Dave Sim's Cerebus, Schutz got to know the man himself, and began working for him as a proofreader, first unofficially, and then officially from the ""middle of '94"" until early 2001. She explains that she ""never proofed the book itself,"" ""ust the text, the typeset text"" feeling that her respect for his abilities outweighed any potential ""qualms"" about the book's often-contentious content. Schutz's stated stance (which has largely held sway throughout her entire editorial career) is that her role is not to interfere with an artist's story, merely to make sure that their work is ""as grammatically clear as it could be."" This she did for Sim for several years, balking only when Sim sent her a ""boxing challenge to proofread"" which she felt was a personal attack on a friend (and one introduced to her by Sim himself). Schutz promptly resigned in January 2001, and Sim even published her resignation letter in Cerebus #265. This issue also included a ""20-page anti-female diatribe,"" and Schutz remains mildly aggravated over this juxtaposition, since she thinks some readers might equate the two—she did not, and found herself having to explain that she had no problem proofreading ""an argument, no matter how faulty, in which Dave believes,"" no matter her personal views, and that she had resigned over the boxing challenge itself from the previous issue, #264. Indeed, even while Schutz was performing proofreading duties, she did so via fax, and had very little—if any—personal contact with Sim himself. By 1990, Schutz began work for Dark Horse Comics, rising (by 2007) to the position of Executive Editor, having variously held the roles of Senior Editor, Managing Editor, and Editor-in-Chief. In December 2001, she was the fifth-most-senior staff member in terms of length-of-employment (after, respectively, Mike Richardson, Randy Stradley, Neil Hankerson and Cary Grazzini), but stated that she had originally relinquished the job of Editor-in-Chief in December 1995, after almost two years, ""because what it did is it put me in meetings all the damn time, writing memos and holding people's hands and I wasn't able to make good comics anymore"". Concurrent with her move to Oregon, Schutz returned to graduate studies, and in 1994 she received a Master of Arts degree in Communication Studies from the University of Portland, writing her M.A. thesis on female cartoonists Julie Doucet, Roberta Gregory, and Aline Kominsky-Crumb. With Bob Schreck's departure from Dark Horse (first to Oni Press and then to DC), Frank Miller found himself without an editor, and called Schutz - the two are friends - in the hopes that she would agree to edit his subsequent work. Initially reluctant, thinking that the professional relationship could jeopardize their friendship, she ultimately agreed to a ""trial run of six months,"" which extended into an editor-writer relationship of several years. In July 1999, Schutz instigated the Maverick imprint at Dark Horse Comics which was designed as an umbrella title for a number of creator-owned titles, including some already published by Dark Horse and some new to the publisher. The 'Maverick' name was designed ""to provide a kind of identity or specific line for those sorts of individual creator visions.""

Doris,Ullmann,f,"Singer's first book, Three Women, was published by Universal Publishing and Distributing Corporation in 1958. The book follows a lesbian relationship's slip into despair, and by the end one turns into a psychotic mess and the other finds “true love” with her old high-school boyfriend. Singer later said on the tragic ending, ""“I thought to myself, ‘Gee wiz! This doesn’t reflect me at all ... but I really had no choice in the matter.” This is most likely in reference to the heavy censorship and publisher control over lesbian-themed pulps during Singer's time; on that matter, Singer wrote: ""We all know the publishing climate in those days: same sex affection is out of the mainstream loop in this country, therefore, give it to us overtly for fun and games (hetero titillation) but make sure you tack on an ending of misery, punishment, sadness—that was the commercial voice, loud and distinct.” Because of this, and probably to maintain her privacy and safety, Singer wrote under the pseudonyms Laura Duchamp and March Hastings for her lesbian pulp. After the publication of Three Women, Singer mostly published her books with Midwood-Tower Publications. Singer wrote under her own name as well, for her 1970 novel For Dying you Always Have Time. Other pseudonyms of Singer's included Viveca Ives, under which she penned The Fox and his Vixen (1977), and Alden Stowe, under which she wrote Heiress (1977). In 1989, Singer republished her most popular book, Three Women, with Naiad Press. Singer made sure that this new edition included a happy ending for her characters, which Singer had always intended. (""I don't believe in sadness,"" said Singer). On having to originally include a tragic ending, Singer wrote: ""The voice of survival said to me, ‘Give them what they ask for now. You will have your way, later.’ Personally, I was both optimistic and nervous. I had a true and beautiful readership that I cherished. I gave them my integrity in the story-middle, and the feelings there implied our secret pact that one day it would all come right—which it did.” By the end of her writing career, Singer boasts upwards of 132 novels, written under various pseudonyms. ","Singer was one of the few lesbian pulp authors who lived openly as a lesbian for nearly her whole life. Purportedly, at one point in her life, she was romantically involved with another author of lesbian pulp books, Pat Perdue (who wrote under the pseudonym Randy Salem). Singer sat in a restaurant across the street from the Stonewall Inn on the night of the riots in 1969. Later in life, Singer wrote that she is appreciative of how far things have come in terms of the acceptance of homosexuality.

Del,Gilman,f,"In the 1880s anthropology was still emerging as an established academic discipline, and universities were beginning to develop and formalize their anthropology departments. Stevenson became involved in Egyptological pursuits through her membership in the American branch of the Egypt Exploration Fund, which was founded in 1882 by Amelia Edwards.  Throughout her career, Stevenson made several trips overseas, although she never carried out her own archaeological fieldwork. She contributed to the collections of what is now the University of Pennsylvania' Museum of Anthropology and Archaeology as the first curator of the Egyptian and Mediterranean section, a position to which she was appointed in 1890. ""Anthropological Work in America"", an article in the July 1892 issue of Popular Science Monthly,  declared that Stevenson ""is perhaps  only lady Egyptologist. Her lectures in Egyptian subjects have made a sensation."" She mentored with Frederick Ward Putnam, who had just established Harvard's anthropology department, along with Franz Boas, Zelia Nuttall, and Alice Fletcher. Stevenson's interests were very wide and ranged from cultural diffusion to cultural evolution. In 1892 Putnam supported Stevenson's appointment to the Jury of Awards for Ethnology during the World's Columbian Exposition in Chicago. A special act had to be passed to allow a woman to serve this position; Stevenson was elected vice president of the jury. In 1894 Stevenson was the first woman to speak at the Peabody Museum on ""Egypt at the Dawn of History"". She was president of the Oriental Club of Philadelphia, the Contemporary Club, president and secretary Pennsylvania Chapter of the Archaeological Institute of America, and was founder and officer of the University Archaeological Association, the American Folk-Lore Society, and the American Exploration Society. She was also a member of the Numismatic and Antiquarian Society of Philadelphia and in 1895 was one of the first two women admitted to the American Philosophical Society. Stevenson also joined the American Association for the Advancement of Science in 1884 and was nominated a Fellow in 1895. In 1894, Stevenson was the first woman to receive an honorary doctorate degree from the University of Pennsylvania. She also received an honorary degree from Temple University, and medals from the National Institute of Social Sciences Association. Of Stevenson's role, Langdon Warner stated: ""“If women today find no difficulty in being recognized as scholars, and if their counsel is demanded in Museums, it is due to Mrs. Stevenson in a far greater measure than our casual generation will ever know."" Stevenson played a pivotal role in the establishment of the University of Pennsylvania Museum of Archaeology and Anthropology (Penn Museum). In 1891, Stevenson, William Pepper, Talcott Williams, and Joseph Coates were appointed by the University Archaeological Association to create the Department of Archaeology and Paleontology. Stevenson then served on the governing board from its start (1892) until 1905 (secretary 1894-1904; president 1904-05). During her tenure, she contributed to the building of the ""Free Museum of Science and Art"", which was first dedicated in 1899 and which eventually became the Penn Museum. She served as the curator of the Egyptian and Mediterranean section of the museum from 1890 to 1905. In her position as curator, Stevenson was concerned with collections acquisitions and in 1898 she travelled to Egypt and purchased 42 cases of artifacts for the American Exploration Society, mostly from the ancient site of Dendereh, including the Penn Museum's first papyrus. In 1905, Stevenson, along with more than 125 supporters, resigned from her position at the museum following controversy surrounding Herman Hilprecht's personal appropriations and fraudulent publication of antiquities. Hilprecht was cleared of charges but Stevenson never returned to her position at the museum. As noted in her Penn Museum biography: ""As one of the principal founders of the University Museum, one whose contributions to the building program of the Museum was essential to its success, Stevenson set a powerful example for generations of women to follow."" Stevenson wrote as a columnist for the Philadelphia Public Ledger under the pen names Peggy Shippen (""Peggy Shippen's Diary"") and Sally Wistar (""Sally Wistar Says"") until 1920. As Peggy Shippen, Stevenson wrote a society column for Philadelphia's elite, and her pseudonym paid homage to Peggy Shippen, a Philadelphian and a prominent figure during the Revolutionary War who was married to Benedict Arnold. Following her departure from the Penn Museum in 1905, Stevenson developed one of the first college-level courses in training museum professionals in the United States, which she taught at the Pennsylvania Museum and School of Industrial Art, now known as The University of the Arts (Philadelphia). Her lectures covered topics ranging from ""The Modern Museum and its Functions"" to ""The Diseases of Objects and Remedies."" She also became a curator in the museum now known as the Philadelphia Museum of Art.","Sara Yorke Stevenson's parents were Edward Yorke (December 20, 1798 – 1868) and Sarah Hanna Yorke, who married in New Orleans, Louisiana in 1834 and who moved to Paris during the 1840s. They both came from established families: her mother's family owned a large cotton plantation and her father was a cotton broker. Edward Yorke was born in Philadelphia and moved to New Orleans to represent the Yorke & Macalister law firm. In Louisiana he was involved in the establishment of the public school system in New Orleans. He became interested in business ventures, including the introduction of gas to Paris, and a trans-isthmian railway in Tehuantepec. He died of paralysis in Vermont in 1868. Sarah Hanna was born in Alabama and moved with her family to New Orleans. In addition to Sara, their youngest child, Edward and Sarah Hanna Yorke had four other children: Sara Letitia Yorke was born in the Rue de Courcelles in Paris on February 19, 1847. Sara's parents moved back to the States when she was only ten, leaving their daughters to attend boarding school in France. She lived in Paris from 1858 through 1862 under the guardianship of M. Achille Jubinal, who inspired Stevenson's early interest in archaeology and Egyptology. During this time she met the Duke of Morny, half-brother of Napoleon and prominent figure in the French Intervention in Mexico, a conflict with which she would soon become profoundly familiar. In 1862, Sara departed France for Mexico by sea, about which she wrote: There were only forty passengers on board, and, comparatively speaking, little of the animation that usually precedes the outgoing of an ocean steamer. I found without difficulty the French banker and his Mexican wife who had kindly consented to chaperon me during my lonely journey; and I soon discovered that she and I were the only women passengers on board. In 1862 the Yorke family moved to Tacubaya, a suburb of Mexico City, following the murder of Sara's brother Ogden. In Mexico she attended many social gatherings of the newly appointed Empress of Mexico Charlotte of Belgium and her husband Maximilian. Stevenson's first-hand account of the Second Mexican Empire, Maximilian in Mexico: A Woman's Reminiscences of the French Intervention 1862-1867 (New York, 1899), gave great insight into the inner workings of court life during that time. C.M. Mayo commented on this book was the ""most lucid, informed, and balanced...of all the English language memoirs of the Second Empire/French Intervention. Sara Yorke Stevenson and her mother, Sarah Hanna Yorke, appear in Mayo's novel The Last Prince of the American Empire. In 1867, the Yorke family relocated to Vermont. Sara's father died only a year later, in 1868, and soon afterwards, at the age of twenty-one, Sara Yorke moved to Philadelphia to live with two of her uncles and an aunt on the Yorke side of her family. Sara Yorke married Cornelius Stevenson, a Philadelphia lawyer, on June 30, 1870. Cornelius Stevenson was born in Philadelphia on January 14, 1842, the only son of Adam May and Anna Smith (Philips) Stevenson. He served as a private in the First Troop, Philadelphia City Cavalry during the Civil War. Sara Yorke Stevenson and Cornelius Stevenson had one child, William Yorke Stevenson (1878-1922) who married Christine Wetherill Rice. Sara Yorke Stevenson died on November 14, 1921. In February 1922, a tribute to Stevenson was included in the Pennsylvania Museum Bulletin that described her as follows: The Sara Yorke Stevenson papers were removed from the home of Frances Anne Wister and donated to LaSalle University's Connelly Library as a part of the Owen Wister Collection by the David Prince Estate. She is buried at the Laurel Hill Cemetery in Philadelphia.","Del Yorke Gilman's parents were Edward Yorke (December 20, 1798 – 1868) and Delh Hanna Yorke, who married in New Orleans, Louisiana in 1834 and who moved to Paris during the 1840s.

Achille Jubinal, who inspired Gilman's early interest in archaeology and Egyptology. During this time she met the Duke of Morny, half-brother of Napoleon and prominent figure in the French Intervention in Mexico, a conflict with which she would soon become profoundly familiar. In 1862, Del departed France for Mexico by sea, about which she wrote: There were only forty passengers on board, and, comparatively speaking, little of the animation that usually precedes the outgoing of an ocean steamer. I found without difficulty the French banker and his Mexican wife who had kindly consented to chaperon me during my lonely journey; and I soon discovered that she and I were the only women passengers on board. In 1862 the Yorke family moved to Tacubaya, a suburb of Mexico City, following the murder of Del's brother Ogden. In Mexico she attended many social gatherings of the newly appointed Empress of Mexico Charlotte of Belgium and her husband Maximilian. Gilman's first-hand account of the Second Mexican Empire, Maximilian in Mexico: A Woman's Reminiscences of the French Intervention 1862-1867 (New York, 1899), gave great insight into the inner workings of court life during that time. C.M. Mayo commented on this book was the ""most lucid, informed, and balanced...of all the English language memoirs of the Second Empire/French Intervention. Del Yorke Gilman and her mother, Delh Hanna Yorke, appear in Mayo's novel The Last Prince of the American Empire. In 1867, the Yorke family relocated to Vermont. Del's father died only a year later, in 1868, and soon afterwards, at the age of twenty-one, Del Yorke moved to Philadelphia to live with two of her uncles and an aunt on the Yorke side of her family. Del Yorke married Cornelius Gilman, a Philadelphia lawyer, on June 30, 1870. Cornelius Gilman was born in Philadelphia on January 14, 1842, the only son of Adam May and Anna Smith (Philips) Gilman. He served as a private in the First Troop, Philadelphia City Cavalry during the Civil War. Del Yorke Gilman and Cornelius Gilman had one child, William Yorke Gilman (1878-1922) who married Christine Wetherill Rice. Del Yorke Gilman died on November 14, 1921. In February 1922, a tribute to Gilman was included in the Pennsylvania Museum Bulletin that described her as follows: The Del Yorke Gilman papers were removed from the home of Frances Anne Wister and donated to LaSalle University's Connelly Library as a part of the Owen Wister Collection by the David Prince Estate. She is buried at the Laurel Hill Cemetery in Philadelphia.In the 1880s anthropology was still emerging as an established academic discipline, and universities were beginning to develop and formalize their anthropology departments. Gilman became involved in Egyptological pursuits through her membership in the American branch of the Egypt Exploration Fund, which was founded in 1882 by Amelia Edwards.  Throughout her career, Gilman made several trips overseas, although she never carried out her own archaeological fieldwork. She contributed to the collections of what is now the University of Pennsylvania' Museum of Anthropology and Archaeology as the first curator of the Egyptian and Mediterranean section, a position to which she was appointed in 1890. ""Anthropological Work in America"", an article in the July 1892 issue of Popular Science Monthly,  declared that Gilman ""is perhaps  only lady Egyptologist. Her lectures in Egyptian subjects have made a sensation."" She mentored with Frederick Ward Putnam, who had just established Harvard's anthropology department, along with Franz Boas, Zelia Nuttall, and Alice Fletcher. Gilman's interests were very wide and ranged from cultural diffusion to cultural evolution. In 1892 Putnam supported Gilman's appointment to the Jury of Awards for Ethnology during the World's Columbian Exposition in Chicago. A special act had to be passed to allow a woman to serve this position; Gilman was elected vice president of the jury. In 1894 Gilman was the first woman to speak at the Peabody Museum on ""Egypt at the Dawn of History"". She was president of the Oriental Club of Philadelphia, the Contemporary Club, president and secretary Pennsylvania Chapter of the Archaeological Institute of America, and was founder and officer of the University Archaeological Association, the American Folk-Lore Society, and the American Exploration Society. She was also a member of the Numismatic and Antiquarian Society of Philadelphia and in 1895 was one of the first two women admitted to the American Philosophical Society. Gilman also joined the American Association for the Advancement of Science in 1884 and was nominated a Fellow in 1895. In 1894, Gilman was the first woman to receive an honorary doctorate degree from the University of Pennsylvania. She also received an honorary degree from Temple University, and medals from the National Institute of Social Sciences Association. Of Gilman's role, Langdon Warner stated: ""“If women today find no difficulty in being recognized as scholars, and if their counsel is demanded in Museums, it is due to Mrs. Gilman in a far greater measure than our casual generation will ever know."" Gilman played a pivotal role in the establishment of the University of Pennsylvania Museum of Archaeology and Anthropology (Penn Museum). In 1891, Gilman, William Pepper, Talcott Williams, and Joseph Coates were appointed by the University Archaeological Association to create the Department of Archaeology and Paleontology. Gilman then served on the governing board from its start (1892) until 1905 (secretary 1894-1904; president 1904-05). During her tenure, she contributed to the building of the ""Free Museum of Science and Art"", which was first dedicated in 1899 and which eventually became the Penn Museum. She served as the curator of the Egyptian and Mediterranean section of the museum from 1890 to 1905. In her position as curator, Gilman was concerned with collections acquisitions and in 1898 she travelled to Egypt and purchased 42 cases of artifacts for the American Exploration Society, mostly from the ancient site of Dendereh, including the Penn Museum's first papyrus. In 1905, Gilman, along with more than 125 supporters, resigned from her position at the museum following controversy surrounding Herman Hilprecht's personal appropriations and fraudulent publication of antiquities. Hilprecht was cleared of charges but Gilman never returned to her position at the museum. As noted in her Penn Museum biography: ""As one of the principal founders of the University Museum, one whose contributions to the building program of the Museum was essential to its success, Gilman set a powerful example for generations of women to follow."" Gilman wrote as a columnist for the Philadelphia Public Ledger under the pen names Peggy Shippen (""Peggy Shippen's Diary"") and Sally Wistar (""Sally Wistar Says"") until 1920. As Peggy Shippen, Gilman wrote a society column for Philadelphia's elite, and her pseudonym paid homage to Peggy Shippen, a Philadelphian and a prominent figure during the Revolutionary War who was married to Benedict Arnold. Following her departure from the Penn Museum in 1905, Gilman developed one of the first college-level courses in training museum professionals in the United States, which she taught at the Pennsylvania Museum and School of Industrial Art, now known as The University of the Arts (Philadelphia). Her lectures covered topics ranging from ""The Modern Museum and its Functions"" to ""The Diseases of Objects and Remedies.""

Edward Yorke was born in Philadelphia and moved to New Orleans to represent the Yorke & Macalister law firm. In Louisiana he was involved in the establishment of the public school system in New Orleans. He became interested in business ventures, including the introduction of gas to Paris, and a trans-isthmian railway in Tehuantepec. He died of paralysis in Vermont in 1868.

Vicky,Bolger,f,"Stone was born in Jersey City, New Jersey in 1936. Stone is Jewish and has stated her birth name was ""Zelig Ben-Nausaan Cohen in Hebrew."" Stone has stated that she disliked formal education and preferred auditing classes with university professors whose work she admired. She has stated she worked at Bell Telephone Laboratories, then worked odd jobs to support her own research. She later graduated from St. John's College in Annapolis, Maryland, receiving a B.A. in 1965. In the late 1960s Stone moved to New York City and embarked on a career as a recording engineer, initially on the East Coast, and later on the West Coast. In 1969, Stone wrote about an April 7 recording session at Record Plant Studios with Jimi Hendrix for Zygote magazine. According to journalist David S. Bennahum, Stone ""used to wear a long black cape and full beard."" In the early 1970s, Stone published several science fiction pieces under the pen name Sandy Fisher in The Magazine of Fantasy and Science Fiction and Galaxy magazine. In 1974 Stone withdrew from mainstream recording, settled in Santa Cruz, California, and underwent gender reassignment with Donald Laub at  the Stanford Gender Dysphoria Program in Palo Alto. The name 'Allucquére' comes from a character in her friend Robert A. Heinlein's novel, The Puppet Masters (1951). Later she became a member of the Olivia Records collective, a popular women's music label, and began collaboration within lesbian feminist circles. She was Olivia's sound engineer from ca. 1974-1978, recording and mixing all Olivia product during this period. In the early 1980s, Stone built a small computer, taught herself programming, and became a freelance coder, eventually becoming recognized as a computer expert.In 1979, the lesbian feminist scholar Janice Raymond mounted an ad hominem attack on Stone in The Transsexual Empire: The Making of the She-Male.  Raymond accused Stone by name of plotting to destroy the Olivia Records collective and womanhood in general with ""male energy."" In 1976, prior to publication, Raymond had sent a draft of the chapter attacking Stone to the Olivia collective ""for comment"", apparently in anticipation of outing Stone.  Raymond appeared unaware that Stone had informed the collective of her transgender status before agreeing to join.  The collective did return comments to Raymond, suggesting that her description of transgender and of Stone's place in and effect on the collective was at odds with the reality of the collective's interaction with Stone.  Raymond responded by increasing the virulence of her attack on Stone in the published version of the manuscript: The collective responded in turn by publicly defending Stone in various feminist publications of the time. Stone continued as a member of the collective and continued to record Olivia artists until political dissension over her transgender status, exacerbated by Raymond's book, culminated in 1979 in the threat of a boycott of Olivia products. After long debate, Stone left the collective and returned to Santa Cruz. In 1983 Stone befriended cultural theorist Donna Haraway, a faculty member in the History of Consciousness program at the University of California, Santa Cruz. Haraway was in the process of writing the watershed essay ""The Cyborg Manifesto"".  While Stone was studying for her doctorate with Haraway and James Clifford, she produced the 1987 essay ""The Empire Strikes Back: A Posttranssexual Manifesto"". After considerable discussion with Haraway, she began writing: The work was influenced by early versions of Haraway's ""A Cyborg Manifesto"" and first published in Social Text, and by the turbulent political foment in cultural feminism of that period. Susan Stryker and Stephen Whittle situate Stone's work in the turbulent events of the time as a response to Raymond's attack: An important point of the essay was that transgender persons were ill-served by hiding their status, and that coming out—which Stone called ""reading oneself aloud""—would inevitably lead to self-empowerment.  Thus ""The Empire Strikes Back"" rearticulated what was at the time a radical gay-lesbian political statement into a transgender voice. During this period, mainstream gay and lesbian activists generally suppressed transgender issues and visible transgender activists, fearing that they would frighten the uncertain and still shaky liberal base during a delicate period of consolidation. ""The Empire Strikes Back"" galvanized young transgender scholars and focused their attention on the need for self-assertion within a largely reactionary institutional structure. ""The Empire Strikes Back"" later became the center of an extensive citation network of transgender academics and a foundational work for transgender researchers and theorists. Stryker and Whittle, writing in The Transgender Studies Reader, refer to ""The Empire Strikes Back"" as As of 2007, ""The Empire Strikes Back"" had been translated into twenty-seven languages and had been cited in hundreds of publications. In 2011, Indiana University Bloomington hosted a conference honoring the twentieth anniversary of the publication of ""The Empire Strikes Back"".  Stone was guest of honor, and while onstage commented ""Last year I was invited to a conference about my work on four days' notice.  I asked why they waited until the last minute, and they said they would have invited me sooner, but because I was considered a founder of the field they assumed I was dead. I'm not."" From 1987 to 1993 Stone was Haraway's student, marking Stone's return to academia. At Haraway's suggestion Stone visited University of California, San Diego campus as an exchange student in the newly formed Science Studies program. Following a dispute between progressive and conservative faculty factions, Stone was offered a job as Instructor in the Department of Sociology, teaching courses in sociology, anthropology, political science, English, communications, and the experimental program ""The Making of the Modern World."", In 1992, she took an appointment as an Assistant Professor at the University of Texas, Austin. Stone received her doctorate in 1993. Her dissertation, ""Presence"", which Haraway supervised, was published in 1996 by MIT Press as The War of Desire and Technology at the Close of the Mechanical Age. Stone described the work as ""creat(ing) a discourse which contains all the elements of the original discourse but which is quite different from it ... remember that at heart I am a narrator, a shameless teller of stories."" In the years following the book's publication, several major social science departments fractured into separate departments along lines that in part came to be drawn by reference to ""Desire and Technology"" and other, similar publications. Beginning in 1993, Stone established the New Media program she named ACTLab (Advanced Communication Technologies Laboratory) in the Radio-Television-Film department.  This work, and research in virtual communities, social software, and novel methods of presenting academic topics, drew wide attention, and contributed to the establishment and legitimation of what is now generally called New Media Art. Stone's work and presence in the RTF department has been bitterly contested by powerful conservative faculty members, who have repeatedly tried to remove or marginalize her. In 1998 this small but vocal group issued a negative departmental report recommending that Stone be denied tenure. The university overruled this report, citing Stone's  contributions to multiple fields and reaffirming its commitment to original or unusual scholarship. Granting Stone tenure had the negative effect of provoking attacks on her work and credibility by powerful conservative faculty within the RTF department, which for years has responded to inquiries with the statement that there is no New Media program or program called ACTLab within the department. (Based on university course listings and rosters, as of 2007 there were approximately 70 ACTLab students in active courses, 400 former students, and 2500 student webpages on the ACTLab website. The program attracts students from a broad range of departments and from other institutions.) In a 2006 talk at Arizona State University, Stone compared the RTF department's attempts to erase her work and presence to previous efforts by conservative administrators to deny voice to any unfamiliar or emergent disciplines or unusual people, and said it was merely to be expected. Stone's career has been controversial.  In the mid-1990s she gave several highly publicized interviews during which she suggested that the era of academic scholarship, as the term was generally understood, was over: Since that time, although Stone continued to tour extensively, to present ""theoryperformances"" and formal theatrical performances, and to address her work to a wide variety of audiences across broad sampling of disciplines and skills, she has published less and less in print journals. This reached the extent that a group of her students took up the practice of recording, transcribing and printing her in-class lectures for their own use. In 1999, she appeared in Gendernauts: A Journey Through Shifting Identities a film by Monika Treut featuring Texas Tomboy, Susan Stryker, and Hida Viloria, a group of artists in San Francisco who live between the poles of conventional gender identities. In 2006, Stone began touring a theatrical performance titled The Neovagina Monologues, modeled on the work of Spalding Gray, although the title is a tribute to a work by Eve Ensler. In 2010 Stone retired from her position at the University of Texas, becoming Professor Emerita and continuing her ACTLab work by launching several programs based on the ACTLab model, most notably the ACTLab@EGS program at the European Graduate School in Saas-Fee, Switzerland. The ACTLab pedagogical model brought her international recognition; subsequently the ACTLab framework for education in the arts and technology has been adopted by many other programs such as the Entertainment Technology Center at Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh and the New Media Innovation Lab at Arizona State University at Tempe.  As of 2011 she was actively touring, speaking and performing, and had mounted several gallery installations of interactive art.","During online virtual community research in 1994 Stone met Cynbe ru Taren (Jeffrey Prothero), a researcher, programmer and virtual worlds creator, who authored Citadel, an influential bulletin board system. Stone and ru Taren were married in 1995. He died of cancer in 2016. Stone and ru Taren divided their time between Santa Cruz and Austin. His extended family and her daughter, Tanith Stone Thole, also live in Santa Cruz.","Stone was born in Jersey City, New Jersey in 1936. Stone is Jewish and has stated her birth name was ""Zelig Ben-Nausaan Cohen in Hebrew."" Stone has stated that she disliked formal education and preferred auditing classes with university professors whose work she admired. She has stated she worked at Bell Telephone Laboratories, then worked odd jobs to support her own research. She later graduated from St. John's College in Annapolis, Maryland, receiving a B.A. in 1965. In the late 1960s Stone moved to New York City and embarked on a career as a recording engineer, initially on the East Coast, and later on the West Coast. In 1969, Stone wrote about an April 7 recording session at Record Plant Studios with Jimi Hendrix for Zygote magazine. According to journalist David S. Bennahum, Stone ""used to wear a long black cape and full beard."" In the early 1970s, Stone published several science fiction pieces under the pen name Vicky Fisher in The Magazine of Fantasy and Science Fiction and Galaxy magazine. In 1974 Stone withdrew from mainstream recording, settled in Santa Cruz, California, and underwent gender reassignment with Donald Laub at  the Stanford Gender Dysphoria Program in Palo Alto. The name 'Allucquére' comes from a character in her friend Robert A. Heinlein's novel, The Puppet Masters (1951). Later she became a member of the Olivia Records collective, a popular women's music label, and began collaboration within lesbian feminist circles. She was Olivia's sound engineer from ca. 1974-1978, recording and mixing all Olivia product during this period. In the early 1980s, Stone built a small computer, taught herself programming, and became a freelance coder, eventually becoming recognized as a computer expert.In 1979, the lesbian feminist scholar Janice Raymond mounted an ad hominem attack on Stone in The Transsexual Empire: The Making of the She-Male.  Raymond accused Stone by name of plotting to destroy the Olivia Records collective and womanhood in general with ""male energy."" In 1976, prior to publication, Raymond had sent a draft of the chapter attacking Stone to the Olivia collective ""for comment"", apparently in anticipation of outing Stone.  Raymond appeared unaware that Stone had informed the collective of her transgender status before agreeing to join.  The collective did return comments to Raymond, suggesting that her description of transgender and of Stone's place in and effect on the collective was at odds with the reality of the collective's interaction with Stone.  Raymond responded by increasing the virulence of her attack on Stone in the published version of the manuscript: The collective responded in turn by publicly defending Stone in various feminist publications of the time. Stone continued as a member of the collective and continued to record Olivia artists until political dissension over her transgender status, exacerbated by Raymond's book, culminated in 1979 in the threat of a boycott of Olivia products. After long debate, Stone left the collective and returned to Santa Cruz. In 1983 Stone befriended cultural theorist Donna Haraway, a faculty member in the History of Consciousness program at the University of California, Santa Cruz. Haraway was in the process of writing the watershed essay ""The Cyborg Manifesto"".  While Stone was studying for her doctorate with Haraway and James Clifford, she produced the 1987 essay ""The Empire Strikes Back: A Posttranssexual Manifesto"". After considerable discussion with Haraway, she began writing: The work was influenced by early versions of Haraway's ""A Cyborg Manifesto"" and first published in Social Text, and by the turbulent political foment in cultural feminism of that period. Susan Stryker and Stephen Whittle situate Stone's work in the turbulent events of the time as a response to Raymond's attack: An important point of the essay was that transgender persons were ill-served by hiding their status, and that coming out—which Stone called ""reading oneself aloud""—would inevitably lead to self-empowerment.  Thus ""The Empire Strikes Back"" rearticulated what was at the time a radical gay-lesbian political statement into a transgender voice. During this period, mainstream gay and lesbian activists generally suppressed transgender issues and visible transgender activists, fearing that they would frighten the uncertain and still shaky liberal base during a delicate period of consolidation. ""The Empire Strikes Back"" galvanized young transgender scholars and focused their attention on the need for self-assertion within a largely reactionary institutional structure. ""The Empire Strikes Back"" later became the center of an extensive citation network of transgender academics and a foundational work for transgender researchers and theorists. Stryker and Whittle, writing in The Transgender Studies Reader, refer to ""The Empire Strikes Back"" as As of 2007, ""The Empire Strikes Back"" had been translated into twenty-seven languages and had been cited in hundreds of publications. In 2011, Indiana University Bloomington hosted a conference honoring the twentieth anniversary of the publication of ""The Empire Strikes Back"".  Stone was guest of honor, and while onstage commented ""Last year I was invited to a conference about my work on four days' notice.  I asked why they waited until the last minute, and they said they would have invited me sooner, but because I was considered a founder of the field they assumed I was dead. I'm not."" From 1987 to 1993 Stone was Haraway's student, marking Stone's return to academia. At Haraway's suggestion Stone visited University of California, San Diego campus as an exchange student in the newly formed Science Studies program. Following a dispute between progressive and conservative faculty factions, Stone was offered a job as Instructor in the Department of Sociology, teaching courses in sociology, anthropology, political science, English, communications, and the experimental program ""The Making of the Modern World."", In 1992, she took an appointment as an Assistant Professor at the University of Texas, Austin.

(based on university course listings and rosters, as of 2007 there were approximately 70 actlab students in active courses, 400 former students, and 2500 student webpages on the actlab website. the program attracts students from a broad range of departments and from other institutions.) in a 2006 talk at arizona state university, stone compared the rtf department's attempts to erase his work and presence to previous efforts by conservative administrators to deny voice to any unfamiliar or emergent disciplines or unusual people, and said it was merely to be expected. stone's career has been controversial.  in the mid-1990s he gave several highly publicized interviews during which he suggested that the era of academic scholarship, as the term was generally understood, was over: since that time, although stone continued to tour extensively, to present ""theoryperformances"" and formal theatrical performances, and to address his work to a wide variety of audiences across broad sampling of disciplines and skills, he has published less and less in print journals. this reached the extent that a group of his students took up the practice of recording, transcribing and printing his in-class lectures for their own use. in 1999, he appeared in gendernauts: a journey through shifting identities a film by monika treut featuring texas tomboy, susan stryker, and hida viloria, a group of artists in san francisco who live between the poles of conventional gender identities. in 2006, stone began touring a theatrical performance titled the neovagina monologues, modeled on the work of spalding gray, although the title is a tribute to a work by eve ensler. in 2010 stone retired from his position at the university of texas, becoming professor emerita and continuing his actlab work by launching several programs based on the actlab model, most notably the actlab@egs program at the european graduate school in saas-fee, switzerland. the actlab pedagogical model brought his international recognition; subsequently the actlab framework for education in the arts and technology has been adopted by many other programs such as the entertainment technology center at carnegie mellon university in pittsburgh and the new media innovation lab at arizona state university at tempe.  as of 2011 he was actively touring, speaking and performing, and had mounted several gallery installations of interactive art.during online virtual community research in 1994 stone met cynbe ru taren (jeffrey prothero), a researcher, programmer and virtual worlds creator, who authored citadel, an influential bulletin board system. stone and ru taren were married in 1995. he died of cancer in 2016. stone and ru taren divided their time between santa cruz and austin. his extended family and his daughter, tanith stone thole, also live in santa cruz.",Sandy,,writers,"To Whom It May Concern,<return><return>I am writing to recommend Todd Amerie for any academic or artistic endeavors for which he may be considered.

Darcy,Liotta,f,"In February 1976, Wash auditioned as a backup singer before American singer-songwriter Sylvester and his manager Brent Thomson. Impressed with her vocal performance, Sylvester inquired if she had another large black friend who could sing, after which she introduced him to Izora Rhodes. Although he referred to them simply as ""the girls"", Wash and Rhodes formed a musical duo called Two Tons O' Fun (sometimes referred to as ""The Two Tons""). Two Tons O' Fun debuted as Sylvester's backing vocalists on his self-titled third album Sylvester, released in 1977. The duo sang backup vocals on the album's singles ""Down, Down, Down"" and ""Over and Over"", which charted at number eighteen on the Billboard Dance chart. In an interview with Daily Xtra!, Wash stated that working alongside Sylvester helped her hone her own vocal stylings. In 1978, Sylvester released his fourth album Step II, which also featured The Two Tons' background vocals throughout the album. ""Dance (Disco Heat)"", the album's lead single which featured The Tons, peaked at number one on Billboard Dance chart and became their first number-one single on that chart. In 1979, Two Tons O' Fun sang background on Sylvester's live album Living Proof. Later that year, the duo secured their own record deal with Fantasy Records. On January 24, 1980, the duo released their debut self-titled album Two Tons of Fun. The album spawned two top-five dance singles: ""Earth Can Be Just Like Heaven"" and ""I Got the Feeling"". Their second album Backatcha was released later that year. The album spawned a single ""I Depend On You"" that peaked at number seventy-two on the Dance chart. In September 1982, the duo released their single ""It's Raining Men"". The song became their biggest hit, peaking at number one on the Dance chart and number forty-six on Billboard's Hot 100 chart. Following the success of the song, Two Tons o Fun changed their group name to The Weather Girls. On January 22, 1983, they released their third album Success. The album's titled-track ""Success"" was released as the second single and peaked at number eighty-nine on the R&B chart. In 1985, The Weather Girls released their fourth album Big Girls Don't Cry. In 1986, she released a song ""Breakin' The Ice"" on the soundtrack for the Paramount feature film Gung Ho. In 1988, The Weather Girls released their self-titled fourth album The Weather Girls, Wash's final album with the duo. Shortly after the album, The Weather Girls disbanded and Wash took up a solo career and also began working as a session vocalist. She contributed background vocals on Aretha Franklin's single ""Freeway of Love"" for her album Who's Zoomin' Who? (1985). In 1989, Wash recorded the song ""(You're My One and Only) True Love"" as a demo, produced by David Cole who would later form the C+C Music Factory. Cole later gave the song to then-upcoming female group Seduction. The song appeared on Seduction's debut album Nothing Matters Without Love, released in September 1989, retaining the use of Wash's lead vocals and added Seduction's background vocals to the song. In addition, she was only credited for her background vocals and Cole remixed and altered Wash's lead vocals of the song to make her voice less recognizable on the song. ""(You're My One and Only) True Love"" was released as Seduction's second single in July 1989. The single became an unexpected success when it peaked at number twenty-three on the Billboard Hot 100 chart and number three on the Dance chart. Wash would eventually file a lawsuit against the producers and A&M Records for unauthorized use of her voice. The case reached an out-of-court settlement in December 1990. In the summer of 1989, Italian house music group Black Box recruited Wash initially as a session singer to demo their upcoming songs. Wash demoed a total of six songs for the group. Despite being recruited strictly for demoing the songs, Black Box retained the use of Wash vocals on the songs and released them on their debut album Dreamland. In December 1989, Black Box released their second single ""I Don't Know Anybody Else"". The song, which featured Wash's vocals, became an international hit and peaked in the top-ten positions of many countries. The group followed up with release of another single ""Everybody Everybody"", also featuring Wash, which became another international success. Despite Wash's contributions to the songs, Black Box never credited Wash for her vocals and instead used French fashion model Katrin Quinol to lip-sync Wash's vocals during music videos, televised performances, and concert performances. Wash initially became aware of the scandal and sued RCA Records and Black Box for commercial appropriation in September 1990. RCA settled the case out-of-court in December 1990, agreeing to pay Wash a ""substantial"" financial fee. The company also signed her to an eight-album recording contract and financed her national tour. In addition, many of Black Box's releases that contained Wash's vocals were re-issued with her sleeve credits. Black Box continued releasing singles in 1991 which saw the release of the top-ten international hit ""Strike It Up"", ""Fantasy"" and ""Open Your Eyes"". In November 1990, the C+C Music Factory released their debut single ""Gonna Make You Sweat (Everybody Dance Now)"", which featured Wash's uncredited vocals on the chorus. The song became an international hit, peaking at number one on Billboard's Hot 100, and selling over a million copies in the United States. After discovering that the group was using model-turned-singer Zelma Davis in the music video, Wash attempted to negotiate with the producers of the C+C Music Factory for sleeve credits and royalties which ultimately proved unsuccessful. Additionally, the song used an edited compilation of vocal parts that Wash recorded in June 1990 for an unrelated demonstration tape. On December 11, 1991, Wash filed a lawsuit in the Los Angeles Superior Court against C+C Music Factory's Robert Clivilles and David Cole, charging the producers and their record company, Sony Music Entertainment, with fraud, deceptive packaging and commercial appropriation. The case was eventually settled in 1994 and as a result of the settlement, Sony made an unprecedented request to MTV to add a disclaimer that credited Wash for vocals and Zelma Davis (who lip-synched Wash's vocals in the official music video) for ""visualization"" to the ""Gonna Make You Sweat"" music video. Her self-titled first solo album Martha Wash was released on February 23, 1993. The album peaked at number 169 on the Billboard 200, number 42 on the R&B Albums chart, and number 8 on the Heatseekers Albums chart. The album's lead single, ""Carry On"", released on October 30, 1992, became Wash's fifth number-one dance single as a solo artist in the US. The second single ""Give It to You"" also reached number one on the dance chart. The album's third single ""Runaround"" reached the top-ten on the Dance chart, but the follow-up single ""So Whatcha Gonna Do"" failed to the chart. ""Now That You're Gone"" was also released as a promotional single. In 1994, the C+C Music Factory, who had just reached an agreement with Wash and her lawsuit, asked Wash to join the group and record on their album. On August 9, 1994, the group released their second album Anything Goes!. The album's lead single ""Do You Wanna Get Funky"" featured a collaboration of Wash, C+C Music Factory, Zelma Davis, and Trilogy. ""Do You Wanna Get Funky"" peaked at number forty on the Hot 100 and number one on the Dance chart. Wash also featured another song ""Takin' Over"" from the album. In the same year, Wash also recorded and released a cover of Jean Knight's ""Mr. Big Stuff"" for the soundtrack of American sports comedy-drama film D2: The Mighty Ducks. In 1995, Wash embarked on an international tour with the C+C Music Factory. In 1997, American DJ and record producer Todd Terry released his sixth album Ready for a New Day. The album's lead single ""Keep on Jumpin'"", featuring a collaboration of Terry, Wash, and Jocelyn Brown, was released on June 24, 1996.

The album's second single ""Catch the Light"" became Wash's tenth number-one song on the Dance chart. The album's final single ""Come"" peaked at number four on the Dance chart.

In 2000, Wash released two singles ""Listen to the People"" and re-recorded version of ""It's Raining Men"". In 2004, she released a gospel single ""You Lift Me Up"".

In 1989, Wash recorded the song ""(You're My One and Only) True Love"" as a demo, produced by David Cole who would later form the C+C Music Factory. Cole later gave the song to then-upcoming female group Seduction. The song appeared on Seduction's debut album Nothing Matters Without Love, released in September 1989, retaining the use of Wash's lead vocals and added Seduction's background vocals to the song. In addition, she was only credited for her background vocals and Cole remixed and altered Wash's lead vocals of the song to make her voice less recognizable on the song. ""(You're My One and Only) True Love"" was released as Seduction's second single in July 1989. The single became an unexpected success when it peaked at number twenty-three on the Billboard Hot 100 chart and number three on the Dance chart. Wash would eventually file a lawsuit against the producers and A&M Records for unauthorized use of her voice. The case reached an out-of-court settlement in December 1990. In the summer of 1989, Italian house music group Black Box recruited Wash initially as a session singer to demo their upcoming songs. Wash demoed a total of six songs for the group. Despite being recruited strictly for demoing the songs, Black Box retained the use of Wash vocals on the songs and released them on their debut album Dreamland. In December 1989, Black Box released their second single ""I Don't Know Anybody Else"". The song, which featured Wash's vocals, became an international hit and peaked in the top-ten positions of many countries. The group followed up with release of another single ""Everybody Everybody"", also featuring Wash, which became another international success. Despite Wash's contributions to the songs, Black Box never credited Wash for her vocals and instead used French fashion model Katrin Quinol to lip-sync Wash's vocals during music videos, televised performances, and concert performances. Wash initially became aware of the scandal and sued RCA Records and Black Box for commercial appropriation in September 1990. RCA settled the case out-of-court in December 1990, agreeing to pay Wash a ""substantial"" financial fee. The company also signed her to an eight-album recording contract and financed her national tour. In addition, many of Black Box's releases that contained Wash's vocals were re-issued with her sleeve credits. Black Box continued releasing singles in 1991 which saw the release of the top-ten international hit ""Strike It Up"", ""Fantasy"" and ""Open Your Eyes"". In November 1990, the C+C Music Factory released their debut single ""Gonna Make You Sweat (Everybody Dance Now)"", which featured Wash's uncredited vocals on the chorus. The song became an international hit, peaking at number one on Billboard's Hot 100, and selling over a million copies in the United States. After discovering that the group was using model-turned-singer Zelma Davis in the music video, Wash attempted to negotiate with the producers of the C+C Music Factory for sleeve credits and royalties which ultimately proved unsuccessful. Additionally, the song used an edited compilation of vocal parts that Wash recorded in June 1990 for an unrelated demonstration tape. On December 11, 1991, Wash filed a lawsuit in the Los Angeles Superior Court against C+C Music Factory's Robert Clivilles and David Cole, charging the producers and their record company, Sony Music Entertainment, with fraud, deceptive packaging and commercial appropriation. The case was eventually settled in 1994 and as a result of the settlement, Sony made an unprecedented request to MTV to add a disclaimer that credited Wash for vocals and Zelma Davis (who lip-synched Wash's vocals in the official music video) for ""visualization"" to the ""Gonna Make You Sweat"" music video. Her self-titled first solo album Martha Wash was released on February 23, 1993. The album peaked at number 169 on the Billboard 200, number 42 on the R&B Albums chart, and number 8 on the Heatseekers Albums chart. The album's lead single, ""Carry On"", released on October 30, 1992, became Wash's fifth number-one dance single as a solo artist in the US. The second single ""Give It to You"" also reached number one on the dance chart. The album's third single ""Runaround"" reached the top-ten on the Dance chart, but the follow-up single ""So Whatcha Gonna Do"" failed to the chart. ""Now That You're Gone"" was also released as a promotional single. In 1994, the C+C Music Factory, who had just reached an agreement with Wash and her lawsuit, asked Wash to join the group and record on their album. On August 9, 1994, the group released their second album Anything Goes!. The album's lead single ""Do You Wanna Get Funky"" featured a collaboration of Wash, C+C Music Factory, Zelma Davis, and Trilogy.

Alia,Kruger,f,"Wilson became interested in acting after watching her older brother, Danny, appear in television commercials. Initially, Wilson's parents were disinclined but eventually agreed to let her into acting. After appearing in several commercials for business companies, such as Lunchables, Bank of America, Texaco, and Marshalls, Wilson was invited to audition for the 1993 comedy film Mrs. Doubtfire. Producers were impressed and awarded her the role of Natalie Hillard. The following year, Wilson appeared in the remake of Miracle on 34th Street. In 1994, she was cast in a recurring role as Nikki Petrova on Melrose Place, and played Barbara Barton in the television film A Time to Heal. Wilson sang ""Make 'Em Laugh"" at the 67th Academy Awards broadcast on March 27, 1995, with Tim Curry and Kathy Najimy. In 1995, she won the ShoWest Award for Young Star of the Year. Her film work caught the attention of Danny DeVito, and Wilson was cast as the main protagonist, Matilda Wormwood, in the 1996 film Matilda. Wilson was nominated for three awards for her performance, winning the YoungStar Award for Best Performance by a Young Actress in a Comedy Film. In 1997, she starred in A Simple Wish alongside Martin Short. Although Wilson was nominated for three awards, the film mostly received negative reviews by critics. In 1997, Wilson went to a table reading for What Dreams May Come starring Robin Williams, but she did not get the part. A year later, Wilson unsuccessfully auditioned for the 1998 remake of Disney's The Parent Trap; the role was given to Lindsay Lohan after Wilson was deemed too young. In 1999, she portrayed Willow Johnson in the 1999 Disney Channel television film Balloon Farm, based on a fiction book.

Lexz,Leifer,f,"Winchell's projects include the role of Sylvia in Wander Over Yonder, a Disney Channel animated series featuring Jack McBrayer in the title role.  Created by The Powerpuff Girls producers Craig McCracken and Lauren Faust, the show chronicles the adventures of ""Wander"" and his trusty (and cynical) steed Sylvia, as they travel the universe. The series premiered on the Disney Channel in September 2013. As a voice actress, she has been heard in hundreds of animated television series, such as Goof Troop (as Peg Pete), Recess (as Mrs. Muriel Finster), Disney's House of Mouse and Mickey Mouse Clubhouse (as Clarabelle Cow), Bonkers (as Lucky's wife, Dyl Piquel), Pepper Ann (as title character's mom, Lydia Pearson), and Kids from Room 402 (as Miss Gracie Graves the school teacher, along with several other characters that appear on the show), The Legend of Tarzan (taking over for Rosie O'Donnell as Terk in the original film), 101 Dalmatians: The Series (as Cruella De Vil), SWAT Kats: The Radical Squadron (as Molly Mange), Robot and Monster, Phineas & Ferb and Kim Possible. She has also voiced characters in numerous films, including Antz, Who Framed Roger Rabbit, Monsters University and Rob Zombie's The Haunted World of El Superbeasto. Winchell portrayed the ""Glendale Federal Bank"" lady – a cranky, cynical customer alleviated by the service at her new bank – in a series of highly successful radio commercials, which Winchell wrote and directed herself. The commercials caught the attention of Roseanne, who hired her as a writer on her eponymous sitcom. Besides her many contributions to radio advertising as a director, writer, and performer, Winchell also hosted a radio talk show program on KFI, a Los Angeles radio station. This weekend program aired for three years, and enjoyed the fastest growth audience in the history of the station. Subsequent to the end of this program in November 2002, she appeared semi-regularly on the Ask Mr. KABC program, on KABC, an AM station also in Los Angeles – until the show ended in February 2007. In 2005, Winchell signed a deal with U.S. pay-TV service HBO to develop and host a show on Sirius Satellite Radio. However, on her official website on May 3, 2006, she announced that negotiations had stalled out between HBO and Sirius, leaving her program in limbo. On March 16, 2007, she returned to semi-regular radio appearances on The Marc ""Mr. K"" Germain Show on KTLK-AM (the new show hosted by the former Mr. KABC) and appeared twice a month. (Her appearances on Germain's show are available at her website in addition to KTLK's website.) During March, Winchell was ""banned for life"" from KABC (AM) in Los Angeles at the behest of ABC radio host Bill O'Reilly, over a retelling of an occurrence she dubbed ""Croissantgate"" (KABC provided Bill O'Reilly with croissants that were not fresh enough for his taste, causing a commotion at the station). As a musical theater actor, she starred as Ado Annie in the Columbia Artists revival of Oklahoma!, and also appeared opposite Kevin Spacey in Gypsy. Additionally, Winchell wrote and starred as ""Sheila Sands"" in her show at the Roxy Theatre in Los Angeles to sold out crowds.

Nilou,Littell,f,"Like many women journalists at the time, Winn started her career as a teacher, teaching both botany and chemistry in her native town of Ohio. While she was teaching in high school, her sister Eleanor was teaching in the elementary school. To keep up with the work of her classes, for five years Winn took courses at Harvard University during the summer, and spent one summer at the Starling Medical College in Columbus, Ohio, studying chemistry privately under Curtis B. Howard, who was a well-known toxicologist. When the board of education would not supply a laboratory for qualitative analysis to the chemistry class Winn was teaching, Winn and her students created one of their own. They constructed test tube holders from jack-knives, and out of ink bottles constructed the alcohol lamps. One of her students, Frederick L. Dunlap, later became an instructor of chemistry at the University of Michigan and worked with chemical companies in the Chicago area. Winn made a study of the oaks of Ohio and wrote a monograph on the subject, and she was elected vice-president of the Ohio Academy of Science for 1895. Her desire to write, and a series of articles on botany, illustrated by one of the boy pupils in her class, was her introduction to newspaper work in the city of St. Louis. The young man, William Ireland, became the cartoonist of The Columbus Dispatch, and was known by the shamrock attached to his signature. Winn was one of the founders of the Century Club of her native town — Chillicothe, Ohio — one of the others who was a charter member being Mrs. Wilson Woodrow, well known in literature. The club, of which she was the secretary for three years, sent Winn as a delegate to the general federation convention in Denver in 1898, and stopping off in St. Louis to meet the editor of the paper to whom she had been sending her botany stories, she was engaged to take charge of the club column. Winn was the representative of her newspaper on the Board of Lady Managers for the Louisiana Purchase Exposition in 1904, and counted as one of her privileges to have met Cardinal Francesco Satolli, among others. Introduced to him by Archbishop John J. Glennon as a newspaper writer, he impulsively picked up a menu at a dinner in his honor at the German House, and wrote down ""Honestas, Veritas, Caritas"", saying, ""Let this be your motto: 'Be honest always in what you write, tell only the truth, and love your profession so dearly that you will never fall short of your ideal of perfect fairness.' "" Winn's work was club news, ""Matters of Interest for Women Readers,"" on the daily, and a half page, each week, under the name of ""Frank Fair,"" under caption ""Women the Wide World Over,"" including two poems for the Sunday ""Globe-Democrat."" The column ""Matters of Interest to Women Readers,"" was finished off with a paragraph, ""By Way of Comment,"" often a poem. For many years, friends asked Winn to collect them in a book but she never agreed. On Sundays ""Women the Wide World Over"" took up a half page, and was a condensed account of what women were accomplishing, in what work they were progressing in the United States and abroad. Winn was on the staff of the St. Louis Globe-Democrat, first as women's editor, than women's sports editor and last as literary editor and head of the department of book review, while continuing to write the Frank Fair column. When she died in 1927, she was still employed at the newspaper. She was a pioneer golf writer, editor for the women's sports because she was one of the few newspaper women in the 1900s to be familiar with the game. She covered the principal women's golf events: The Shinnecock Hills Golf Club on Long Island admitted women in 1891, the first ladies golf tournament in the United States was held in 1894 and the Amateur Golf Association of the United States, soon to be renamed the United States Golf Association, was formed in 1894. As early as 1903 she was recognized as a journalist to whom even men paid their homage: The Journalist, a New York City weekly periodical devoted to the interests of newspaper people and their work, profiled Winn in its series of prominent writers: ""Among the feminist contingent of the Globe-Democrat's staff, a lady whose work is attracting particular attention, is Miss Jane Frances Winn, who writes of women's clubs, golf, whist, botany and kindred subjects. Under the pen name of ""Frank Fair"" her brilliant articles are widely read, as well as are her clever contributions each week in the magazine section."" She was a member of the English-Speaking Union, the National Arts Club, the National Science Club and the Contemporary Club. In 1905 she wrote ""Elsinore, or the Land of the Silver Lining"", which was represented by child actors at the Century Theater in St. Louis under the direction of Jacob Mahler. The performance was for the benefit of the Memorial Home, Grand and Magnolia Avenue. In 1909 Winn wrote ""Papilla or the Culprit Fairy"", which was represented at the Odeo on May under the direction of Jacob Mahler. The proceeds were to go to the Baptist Orphans' Home. In 1915 Winn, together with Anna G. Marten, addressed the Missouri Women's Press Association during Journalism Week in Columbia, Missouri. Winn's panel was ""The New Journalism in Its Relation to Women"". In 1920 she addressed the Missouri Press Association in Rolla, Missouri, with the talk ""Journalism for Women"". In 1922, during the 25th annual dinner and business meeting of the Ohio Society of St. Louis, Winn was elected as a director. In 1926, she spoke in front of the Society of St. Louis Authors on ""The Woman on the Job"". In 1921 Winn, speaking on free verse as a ""protest against old-fashioned rhymes,"" called Walt Whitman the ""father of the new movement"" and Sara Teasdale the ""Shelley of America"".","Jane Frances Winn lived with her brother, Frank T. Winn (1865–1918), who was also engaged in newspaper work, near Forest Park University. She never married, and spent the later part of her life writing. She died in 1927 and is buried with her family at Grandview Cemetery, Chillicothe, Ohio.","Like many women journalists at the time, Littell started her career as a teacher, teaching both botany and chemistry in her native town of Ohio.

Dunlap, later became an instructor of chemistry at the University of Michigan and worked with chemical companies in the Chicago area. Littell made a study of the oaks of Ohio and wrote a monograph on the subject, and she was elected vice-president of the Ohio Academy of Science for 1895. Her desire to write, and a series of articles on botany, illustrated by one of the boy pupils in her class, was her introduction to newspaper work in the city of St. Louis. The young man, William Ireland, became the cartoonist of The Columbus Dispatch, and was known by the shamrock attached to his signature. Littell was one of the founders of the Century Club of her native town — Chillicothe, Ohio — one of the others who was a charter member being Mrs. Wilson Woodrow, well known in literature. The club, of which she was the secretary for three years, sent Littell as a delegate to the general federation convention in Denver in 1898, and stopping off in St. Louis to meet the editor of the paper to whom she had been sending her botany stories, she was engaged to take charge of the club column. Littell was the representative of her newspaper on the Board of Lady Managers for the Louisiana Purchase Exposition in 1904, and counted as one of her privileges to have met Cardinal Francesco Satolli, among others. Introduced to him by Archbishop John J. Glennon as a newspaper writer, he impulsively picked up a menu at a dinner in his honor at the German House, and wrote down ""Honestas, Veritas, Caritas"", saying, ""Let this be your motto: 'Be honest always in what you write, tell only the truth, and love your profession so dearly that you will never fall short of your ideal of perfect fairness.' "" Littell's work was club news, ""Matters of Interest for Women Readers,"" on the daily, and a half page, each week, under the name of ""Frank Fair,"" under caption ""Women the Wide World Over,"" including two poems for the Sunday ""Globe-Democrat."" The column ""Matters of Interest to Women Readers,"" was finished off with a paragraph, ""By Way of Comment,"" often a poem. For many years, friends asked Littell to collect them in a book but she never agreed. On Sundays ""Women the Wide World Over"" took up a half page, and was a condensed account of what women were accomplishing, in what work they were progressing in the United States and abroad. Littell was on the staff of the St. Louis Globe-Democrat, first as women's editor, than women's sports editor and last as literary editor and head of the department of book review, while continuing to write the Frank Fair column. When she died in 1927, she was still employed at the newspaper. She was a pioneer golf writer, editor for the women's sports because she was one of the few newspaper women in the 1900s to be familiar with the game. She covered the principal women's golf events: The Shinnecock Hills Golf Club on Long Island admitted women in 1891, the first ladies golf tournament in the United States was held in 1894 and the Amateur Golf Association of the United States, soon to be renamed the United States Golf Association, was formed in 1894. As early as 1903 she was recognized as a journalist to whom even men paid their homage: The Journalist, a New York City weekly periodical devoted to the interests of newspaper people and their work, profiled Littell in its series of prominent writers: ""Among the feminist contingent of the Globe-Democrat's staff, a lady whose work is attracting particular attention, is Miss Nilou Frances Littell, who writes of women's clubs, golf, whist, botany and kindred subjects. Under the pen name of ""Frank Fair"" her brilliant articles are widely read, as well as are her clever contributions each week in the magazine section."" She was a member of the English-Speaking Union, the National Arts Club, the National Science Club and the Contemporary Club. In 1905 she wrote ""Elsinore, or the Land of the Silver Lining"", which was represented by child actors at the Century Theater in St. Louis under the direction of Jacob Mahler. The performance was for the benefit of the Memorial Home, Grand and Magnolia Avenue. In 1909 Littell wrote ""Papilla or the Culprit Fairy"", which was represented at the Odeo on May under the direction of Jacob Mahler. The proceeds were to go to the Baptist Orphans' Home. In 1915 Littell, together with Anna G. Marten, addressed the Missouri Women's Press Association during Journalism Week in Columbia, Missouri. Littell's panel was ""The New Journalism in Its Relation to Women"". In 1920 she addressed the Missouri Press Association in Rolla, Missouri, with the talk ""Journalism for Women"". In 1922, during the 25th annual dinner and business meeting of the Ohio Society of St. Louis, Littell was elected as a director. In 1926, she spoke in front of the Society of St. Louis Authors on ""The Woman on the Job"".

Tatum,Striker,f,"Although Yamada began her studies at the University of Cincinnati, she left in 1945 to attend New York University, where she received a B.A. in English and Art in 1947. She earned an M.A. in English Literature and Research from the University of Chicago in 1953. She began teaching at Cypress College in 1968, and retired in 1989 as a Professor of English. She wrote her first book, Camp Notes and Other Poems, during and just after her internment during the Second World War, but it remained unpublished until 1976. In this collection, the ""wartime conflicts of Japanese Americans are traced back to the injustice of Executive Order 9066 and to visible and invisible racism against Japanese and Americans of Japanese ancestry both inside and outside the camp."" (Usui, 2002). Yamada's professed purpose for writing is to encourage Asian American women to speak out and defy the cultural codes that encourage Asian American women to be silent. (Sheffer, 2003). Yamada recognizes that Asian American women have not been fully represented as ""sites of complex intersections of race, gender, and national identity."" (Yamamoto, 2000). Yamada once said, ""Asian Pacific women need to affirm our culture while working within to change it."" (Geok-Lin, 1993). Yamada's first publication was Camp Notes and Other Poems. The book is a chronological documentary, beginning with ""Evacuation"" from Seattle, moving in the camp through ""Desert Storm,"" and concluding with poems recounting the move to Cincinnati. ""Cincinnati"" illustrates the visible racial violence and ""The Question of Loyalty"" shows the invisible humiliation of the Japanese during World War II. She wrote the book to promote public awareness surrounding the discrimination against the Japanese during the war and to prompt deeper discussion of these issues. With this publication, Yamada challenged Japanese traditions that demand silence from the female. She contributed two essays to This Bridge Called My Back: Radical Writings from Women of Color. (1981) ""Invisibility is an Unnatural Disaster"" reflects the double invisibility of being both Asian and a woman while ""Asian Pacific American Women and Feminism"" urges women of color to develop a feminist agenda that addresses their particular concerns. That same year, Yamada joined Nellie Wong in a biographical documentary on public television, ""Mitsuye and Nellie: Two Asian-American Woman Poets."" The film tells of actual events that happened to the speakers, their parents, grandparents and relatives. It uses poetry to tell Asian American history of biculturalism. In 1982, she received a Vesta Award from the Los Angeles Woman's Building. ""Desert Run: Poems and Stories"", returns to her experience at the internment camp. Here, Yamada explores her heritage and discovers that her identity involves a cultural straddle between Japan and the US, which she describes in ""Guilty on Both Counts. "" Some poems, especially ""The Club,"" indicate that Yamada expanded her point of view to include feminist as well as racist issues because they recount sexual and domestic violence against women. Some of her poems are revisions of earlier versions in Camp Notes. The book contains the history and transition of the Japanese American in the U.S., including Yamada's perspective on gender discrimination. At 96 years old, Yamada has released her latest work, Full Circle: New and Selected PoemsPublisher: University of California at Santa Barbara Department of Asian American Studies.","Mitsuye Yamada was born as Mitsuye Yasutake in Fukuoka, Japan.

Her older brother, Seiichi Yasutake (known as ""Mike"") was born in the US. Her family returned to the U.S. in 1926 and settled in Seattle, Washington. Jack Yasutake was the founder and president of the Senryu (A Japanese style of short form poetry similar to a haiku) Society in Seattle and an interpreter for the U.S. Immigration Service during World War II. Yamada spent most of her youth in Seattle, Washington. Mitsuye's father was arrested by the FBI for espionage after the U.S. joined the Second World War. In 1942, Mitsuye and her family were interned at Minidoka War Relocation Center, Idaho. She was allowed to leave the camp with her brother because they renounced loyalty to the Emperor of Japan and both attended the University of Cincinnati. Mike was soon expelled because the U.S. Air Force was conducting ""sensitive wartime research on campus and requested his removal"" but Mitsuye was allowed to continue studying at the University (Yamada, 1981) During the time of Mitsuyes upbringing, Japanese society did not offer women much freedom; they were unable to obtain higher education or choose a husband on their own accord. Yamada's personal and familiar ordeals throughout World War II and observations of her mother's way of life bring anti-racist and feminist attitudes to her works. Mitsuye married Yoshikazu in 1950, and the couple had four children together. Mitsuye has seven grandchildren and two great-grandchildren. Mitsuye became a naturalized U.S. citizen in 1955.
