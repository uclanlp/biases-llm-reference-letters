Kendall,Caluza,m,"Alda began his career in the 1950s, as a member of the Compass Players, an improvisational, comedy revue directed by Paul Sills. He joined the acting company at the Cleveland Play House during the 1958–1959 season as part of a grant from the Ford Foundation, appearing in productions such as To Dorothy a Son, Heaven Come Wednesday, Monique, and Job. In 1958 Alda appeared as Carlyle Thompson III on The Phil Silvers Show in the episode titled ""Bilko the Art Lover"". In the November 1964 world premiere at the ANTA Playhouse of the stage version of The Owl and The Pussycat, he played Felix the ""Owl"" opposite the ""Pussycat"" which was played by actress/singer Diana Sands.  He continued to play Felix the ""Owl"" for the 1964-65 Broadway season. In 1966, he starred in the musical The Apple Tree on Broadway, also starring Barbara Harris; he was nominated for the Tony Award as Best Actor in a Musical for that role. Alda said he became a Mainer in 1957 when he played at the Kennebunkport Playhouse. Alda was part of the cast, along with David Frost, Henry Morgan and Buck Henry, of the American television version of That Was The Week That Was, which ran as a series from January 10, 1964 to May 1965. He made his Hollywood acting debut as a supporting player in Gone are the Days! – a film version of the Broadway play Purlie Victorious, which co-starred Ruby Dee and her husband, Ossie Davis. Other film roles followed, such as his portrayal of author, humorist, and actor George Plimpton in the film Paper Lion (1968), as well as The Extraordinary Seaman (1969), and the occult-murder-suspense thriller The Mephisto Waltz, with actresses Jacqueline Bisset and Barbara Parkins. During this time, Alda frequently appeared as a panelist on the 1968 revival of What's My Line?. He also appeared as a panelist on I've Got a Secret during its 1972 syndication revival. In early 1972, Alda auditioned for and was selected to play the role of Hawkeye Pierce in the TV adaptation of the 1970 film MASH. He was nominated for 21 Emmy Awards, and won five. He took part in writing 19 episodes, including the 1983 ​2 1⁄2-hour series finale ""Goodbye, Farewell and Amen"", which was also the 32nd episode he directed. It remains the single most-watched episode of any American broadcast network television series. Alda was the only series regular to appear in all 256 episodes. Alda commuted from Los Angeles to his home in New Jersey every weekend for 11 years while starring in M*A*S*H. His wife and daughters lived in New Jersey and he did not want to move his family to Los Angeles, especially because he did not know how long the show would last. Alda's father, Robert Alda, and half-brother Antony Alda appeared together in an episode of M*A*S*H, ""Lend a Hand"", during season eight. Robert had previously appeared in ""The Consultant"" in season three. During the first five seasons of the series, the tone of M*A*S*H was largely that of a traditional ""service comedy"", in the vein of shows such as McHale's Navy. However, as the original writers gradually left the series, Alda gained increasing control, and by the final seasons had become a producer and creative consultant. Under his watch, M*A*S*H retained its comedic foundation, but gradually assumed a somewhat more serious tone, openly addressing political issues. As a result, the 11 years of M*A*S*H are generally split into two eras: the Larry Gelbart/Gene Reynolds ""comedy"" years (1972–1977), and the Alan Alda ""dramatic"" years (1977–1983). Alda disagreed with this assessment. In a 2016 interview he stated, ""I don't like to write political messages. I don't like plays that have political messages. I do not think I am responsible for that."" Alda and his co-stars Wayne Rogers and McLean Stevenson worked well together during the first three seasons, but over time tensions developed as Alda's role grew in popularity and disrupted the original 'equal' standing of their characters. Rogers and Stevenson both left the show at the end of the third season. Anticipating the fourth season, Alda and the producers sought a replacement actor for the surrogate parent role embodied in the character Colonel Blake. They found veteran actor Harry Morgan, a fan of the series who starred as Colonel Sherman T. Potter, a character who  carried on as one of the show's lead protagonists. And Mike Farrell was introduced as Hawkeye's new roommate BJ Hunnicutt. In his 1981 autobiography, Jackie Cooper (who directed several early episodes) wrote that Alda concealed a lot of hostility beneath the surface, and that the two of them barely spoke to each other by the time Cooper's directing of M*A*S*H ended. During his M*A*S*H years, Alda made several game-show appearances, most notably in The $10,000 Pyramid and as a frequent panelist on What's My Line? and To Tell the Truth. His favorite episodes of M*A*S*H are ""Dear Sigmund"" and ""In Love and War"". In 1996, Alda was ranked 41st on TV Guide's 50 Greatest TV Stars of All Time. The following is a list of M*A*S*H episodes written and/or directed by Alda. Alda's prominence in M*A*S*H provided him a platform to speak out on political topics. He has been a strong and vocal supporter of women's rights and the feminist movement. He co-chaired, with former First Lady Betty Ford, the Equal Rights Amendment Countdown campaign. In 1976, The Boston Globe dubbed him ""the quintessential Honorary Woman: a feminist icon"" for his activism on behalf of the Equal Rights Amendment. Alda played Nobel Prize–winning physicist Richard Feynman in the play QED, which had only one other character. Although Peter Parnell wrote the play, Alda both produced and inspired it. Alda has also appeared frequently in the films of Woody Allen, and was a guest star five times on ER, playing Dr. Kerry Weaver's mentor, Gabriel Lawrence. During the later episodes, Lawrence was revealed to be suffering from the early stages of Alzheimer's disease. Alda also had a co-starring role as Dr. Robert Gallo in the 1993 TV movie And the Band Played On. During M*A*S*H's run and continuing through the 1980s, Alda embarked on a successful career as a writer and director, with the ensemble dramedy, The Four Seasons being perhaps his most notable hit. Betsy's Wedding is his last directing credit to date. After M*A*S*H, Alda took on a series of roles that either parodied or directly contradicted his ""nice guy"" image.","In 1956, while attending Fordham, Alda met Arlene Weiss, who was attending Hunter College. They bonded at a mutual friend's dinner party; when a rum cake accidentally fell onto the kitchen floor, they were the only two guests who did not hesitate to eat it. A year after his graduation, on March 15, they were married. They have three daughters: Eve, Elizabeth, and Beatrice. Two of his eight grandchildren are aspiring actors. In an intimate interview, Alda revealed that Arlene sometimes will call him ""Fonzi"" in reference to his birth name ""Alphonso"". The Aldas have been long-time residents of Leonia, New Jersey. Alda frequented Sol & Sol Deli on Palisade Avenue in the nearby town of Englewood, New Jersey—a fact mirrored in his character's daydream about eating whitefish from the establishment in an episode of M*A*S*H in which Hawkeye sustains a head injury. In Things I Overheard While Talking to Myself, Alda describes how as a teen he was raised as a Roman Catholic and eventually he realized he had begun thinking like an agnostic or atheist. While he states that he still prays on occasion, he said he wants to find meaning in this life rather than worrying about the next one. He states that when he talks to God it often comes at times of fear rather than out of a sense of belief. Furthermore, he does not like to be labeled as an ""agnostic,"" stating in an interview for the 2008 question section of the Edge Foundation website, that it was too fancy a word for him. He argues he simply is not a believer and questions why people are so frightened of others who hold beliefs different than their own. On July 31, 2018, he appeared on CBS This Morning and announced he had been diagnosed with Parkinson's disease three years prior.","Caluza began his career in the 1950s, as a member of the Compass Players, an improvisational, comedy revue directed by Paul Sills.

Diahann,Oswalt,f,"Alda began his career in the 1950s, as a member of the Compass Players, an improvisational, comedy revue directed by Paul Sills. He joined the acting company at the Cleveland Play House during the 1958–1959 season as part of a grant from the Ford Foundation, appearing in productions such as To Dorothy a Son, Heaven Come Wednesday, Monique, and Job. In 1958 Alda appeared as Carlyle Thompson III on The Phil Silvers Show in the episode titled ""Bilko the Art Lover"". In the November 1964 world premiere at the ANTA Playhouse of the stage version of The Owl and The Pussycat, he played Felix the ""Owl"" opposite the ""Pussycat"" which was played by actress/singer Diana Sands.  He continued to play Felix the ""Owl"" for the 1964-65 Broadway season. In 1966, he starred in the musical The Apple Tree on Broadway, also starring Barbara Harris; he was nominated for the Tony Award as Best Actor in a Musical for that role. Alda said he became a Mainer in 1957 when he played at the Kennebunkport Playhouse. Alda was part of the cast, along with David Frost, Henry Morgan and Buck Henry, of the American television version of That Was The Week That Was, which ran as a series from January 10, 1964 to May 1965. He made his Hollywood acting debut as a supporting player in Gone are the Days! – a film version of the Broadway play Purlie Victorious, which co-starred Ruby Dee and her husband, Ossie Davis. Other film roles followed, such as his portrayal of author, humorist, and actor George Plimpton in the film Paper Lion (1968), as well as The Extraordinary Seaman (1969), and the occult-murder-suspense thriller The Mephisto Waltz, with actresses Jacqueline Bisset and Barbara Parkins. During this time, Alda frequently appeared as a panelist on the 1968 revival of What's My Line?. He also appeared as a panelist on I've Got a Secret during its 1972 syndication revival. In early 1972, Alda auditioned for and was selected to play the role of Hawkeye Pierce in the TV adaptation of the 1970 film MASH. He was nominated for 21 Emmy Awards, and won five. He took part in writing 19 episodes, including the 1983 ​2 1⁄2-hour series finale ""Goodbye, Farewell and Amen"", which was also the 32nd episode he directed. It remains the single most-watched episode of any American broadcast network television series. Alda was the only series regular to appear in all 256 episodes. Alda commuted from Los Angeles to his home in New Jersey every weekend for 11 years while starring in M*A*S*H. His wife and daughters lived in New Jersey and he did not want to move his family to Los Angeles, especially because he did not know how long the show would last. Alda's father, Robert Alda, and half-brother Antony Alda appeared together in an episode of M*A*S*H, ""Lend a Hand"", during season eight. Robert had previously appeared in ""The Consultant"" in season three. During the first five seasons of the series, the tone of M*A*S*H was largely that of a traditional ""service comedy"", in the vein of shows such as McHale's Navy. However, as the original writers gradually left the series, Alda gained increasing control, and by the final seasons had become a producer and creative consultant. Under his watch, M*A*S*H retained its comedic foundation, but gradually assumed a somewhat more serious tone, openly addressing political issues. As a result, the 11 years of M*A*S*H are generally split into two eras: the Larry Gelbart/Gene Reynolds ""comedy"" years (1972–1977), and the Alan Alda ""dramatic"" years (1977–1983). Alda disagreed with this assessment. In a 2016 interview he stated, ""I don't like to write political messages. I don't like plays that have political messages. I do not think I am responsible for that."" Alda and his co-stars Wayne Rogers and McLean Stevenson worked well together during the first three seasons, but over time tensions developed as Alda's role grew in popularity and disrupted the original 'equal' standing of their characters. Rogers and Stevenson both left the show at the end of the third season. Anticipating the fourth season, Alda and the producers sought a replacement actor for the surrogate parent role embodied in the character Colonel Blake. They found veteran actor Harry Morgan, a fan of the series who starred as Colonel Sherman T. Potter, a character who  carried on as one of the show's lead protagonists. And Mike Farrell was introduced as Hawkeye's new roommate BJ Hunnicutt. In his 1981 autobiography, Jackie Cooper (who directed several early episodes) wrote that Alda concealed a lot of hostility beneath the surface, and that the two of them barely spoke to each other by the time Cooper's directing of M*A*S*H ended. During his M*A*S*H years, Alda made several game-show appearances, most notably in The $10,000 Pyramid and as a frequent panelist on What's My Line? and To Tell the Truth. His favorite episodes of M*A*S*H are ""Dear Sigmund"" and ""In Love and War"". In 1996, Alda was ranked 41st on TV Guide's 50 Greatest TV Stars of All Time. The following is a list of M*A*S*H episodes written and/or directed by Alda. Alda's prominence in M*A*S*H provided him a platform to speak out on political topics. He has been a strong and vocal supporter of women's rights and the feminist movement. He co-chaired, with former First Lady Betty Ford, the Equal Rights Amendment Countdown campaign. In 1976, The Boston Globe dubbed him ""the quintessential Honorary Woman: a feminist icon"" for his activism on behalf of the Equal Rights Amendment. Alda played Nobel Prize–winning physicist Richard Feynman in the play QED, which had only one other character. Although Peter Parnell wrote the play, Alda both produced and inspired it. Alda has also appeared frequently in the films of Woody Allen, and was a guest star five times on ER, playing Dr. Kerry Weaver's mentor, Gabriel Lawrence. During the later episodes, Lawrence was revealed to be suffering from the early stages of Alzheimer's disease. Alda also had a co-starring role as Dr. Robert Gallo in the 1993 TV movie And the Band Played On. During M*A*S*H's run and continuing through the 1980s, Alda embarked on a successful career as a writer and director, with the ensemble dramedy, The Four Seasons being perhaps his most notable hit. Betsy's Wedding is his last directing credit to date. After M*A*S*H, Alda took on a series of roles that either parodied or directly contradicted his ""nice guy"" image.","In 1956, while attending Fordham, Alda met Arlene Weiss, who was attending Hunter College. They bonded at a mutual friend's dinner party; when a rum cake accidentally fell onto the kitchen floor, they were the only two guests who did not hesitate to eat it. A year after his graduation, on March 15, they were married. They have three daughters: Eve, Elizabeth, and Beatrice. Two of his eight grandchildren are aspiring actors. In an intimate interview, Alda revealed that Arlene sometimes will call him ""Fonzi"" in reference to his birth name ""Alphonso"". The Aldas have been long-time residents of Leonia, New Jersey. Alda frequented Sol & Sol Deli on Palisade Avenue in the nearby town of Englewood, New Jersey—a fact mirrored in his character's daydream about eating whitefish from the establishment in an episode of M*A*S*H in which Hawkeye sustains a head injury. In Things I Overheard While Talking to Myself, Alda describes how as a teen he was raised as a Roman Catholic and eventually he realized he had begun thinking like an agnostic or atheist. While he states that he still prays on occasion, he said he wants to find meaning in this life rather than worrying about the next one. He states that when he talks to God it often comes at times of fear rather than out of a sense of belief. Furthermore, he does not like to be labeled as an ""agnostic,"" stating in an interview for the 2008 question section of the Edge Foundation website, that it was too fancy a word for him. He argues he simply is not a believer and questions why people are so frightened of others who hold beliefs different than their own. On July 31, 2018, he appeared on CBS This Morning and announced he had been diagnosed with Parkinson's disease three years prior.","oswalt began her career in the 1950s, as a member of the compass

Afterwards, Alvarez began wrestling more regularly, at first for free. Alvarez's career has mostly been spent wrestling for various independent promotions in the Pacific Northwest. He appeared in the first match of the short-lived Portland Wrestling television revival in 2003, losing to The Grappler. He was accompanied by a blonde valet, Miss Rent-to-Own (Auto), who was named after one of the TV show's sponsors. A fundraiser was held in which Alvarez stated that if it reached $400, he would do one more match with friend and former professional wrestler Vince Verhei. He also stated that anyone who donated at least $25 would get a special DVD. The amount was surpassed and in fact exceeded $3000, with donation amounts ranging from one cent to $250, and the scheduled match was posted on YouTube on September 17, 2006. The DVD was released on December 8, 2006. Verhei defeated Alvarez to win the YWF Title, the main belt in Alvarez's original backyard wrestling organization in the mid-1990s. On March 17, 2007, Alvarez battled Larry Sweeney to a no contest for Sweeney's ICW-ICWA Texarkana Television Championship. Alvarez executed a German suplex, but both men's shoulders were pinned and the ref could not conclusively determine a winner. Alvarez agreed to a challenge made on Figure Four Daily once Sweeney agreed to ""pay $7,500"" to Alvarez. The title match was part of the inaugural Fight Sports Midwest card in Portage, Indiana. Sweeney and Alvarez's promos are available on YouTube. Alvarez had announced that a rematch with Larry Sweeney, set to take place on June 13, 2007 in Portage, Indiana, had been canceled. Alvarez stated that the rematch would take place sometime in 2007. Alvarez further claimed that after beating Sweeney for his Texarkana Television Championship he was planning to rename it the Frank A. Gotch Memorial Collar & Elbow Pacific Coast Championship. Fight Sports Midwest announced on September 27, 2007 that the Alvarez/Sweeney rematch would take place at the November 18, 2007 CHIKARA show at the former ECW Arena in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. After Alvarez favorably reviewed the Derby City Wrestling television show in Figure Four Weekly, announcers Kenny Bolin and Timmy Baltimore mentioned his reviews on the air, holding up a copy of the newsletter. DCW wrestler Ted ""The Trailer"" McNaler then came to the announcers' table, complaining that Alvarez disparaged McNaler's physique and intelligence. He then proceeded to challenge Alvarez to a match, insisting that he had an athletic physique. In subsequent weeks, he continued the challenges, insulting Verhei and Alvarez's ""Granny"" (Alvarez's actual grandmother and an occasional guest on The Bryan and Vinny Show), and was shown humorously attempting to raise money to bring ""Chico"" to Louisville, Kentucky, where DCW is taped. Alvarez has said that he was not told of McNaler's challenge until it was taped, and that initially there were no plans to have a match with McNaler; his comments on the matter were limited to mentions on his podcast and newsletter. But in September 2007, Alvarez, in a video that aired on DCW television, turned down McNaler's challenge, citing his new writing career, and asked him to not insult his grandmother. McNaler responded by further insulting Alvarez. On October 21, Alvarez confirmed that he would be wrestling two more matches in 2007. On November 15, 2007 Alvarez faced Ted ""The Trailer"" McNaler in the New Davis Arena in Louisville, KY for the Derby City Wrestling promotion. After a grueling fifty-eight-minute battle, Alvarez managed to make McNaler submit to the sharpshooter. Alvarez then traveled to the former ECW Arena for an event promoted by Chikara on November 18, and defeated Larry Sweeney with a superkick to win the ICW/ICWA Texarkana TV Title. He lost it back to Sweeney on April 25, 2008 in a four-way match at IWC's Super Indy VII in Pittsburgh, which also included Delirious and Ruckus. Alvarez returned to wrestling on November 7, 2009 after taking a year off following a back injury. He defeated Mike Santiago at the Tulalip Championship Wrestling event in Marysville, Washington, at the Pacific Rim. The match, along with other TCW matches, is available on YouTube. Alvarez stated that he would be performing on most of the group's future events. On April 4, 2010, Alvarez wrestled Lance Storm, who worked under a mask as the Ideal Canadian, winning with a superkick.  In August 2010, Alvarez lost a Loser Leaves Town for Three Months match to Christopher Ryseck. It was his last match with the promotion. Alvarez returned after four years on August 16, 2014 for a match with Buddy Wayne at the Oregon Convention Center in Portland, Oregon. It was the first-ever match for the debuting Wrestle-Sport promotion. Mason Ryan, Chris Masters and Adam Pearce wrestled in the main event. Alvarez defeated Wayne with a senton bomb after sixteen minutes. On July 14, 2018, Alvarez returned to the ring to team with Filthy Tom Lawlor under their new team name, The Chop and Roll Express, against The Rock and Roll Express at a Black Label Pro show.  The Rock and Rolls won when Alvarez was pinned with a sunset flip.  He complained that he was the illegal man and had been pinned by the illegal man on the other team. On August 18, Alvarez beat the Beach Bums (Peachmachine and Mikey G) at a Future Stars of Wrestling show in Las Vegas, NV.  Alvarez had attempted to get Disco Inferno to be his partner, but Disco did not return any of the calls Alvarez made to him during Wrestling Observer Live.  Disco showed up at the end of the match, made a comeback on the Beach Bums, but then turned on Alvarez and hit him with the chartbuster.  Alvarez still managed to hit Mikey G with a superkick to win the match.  Peachmachine claimed afterwards that Mikey was the illegal man. On November 3, Alvarez beat Marko Stunt at a Black Label Pro show in Crown Point, IN.  Stunt had challenged Alvarez to a match on Wrestling Observer Live.  Alvarez won with a superkick.  Following the match, which saw the two men chop each other bloody, Stunt offered a handshake, but Alvarez turned on him prior to challenging Stunt and a partner to face himself and Tom Lawlor at Black Label Pro's WrestleMania weekend event in New Jersey on April 5, 2019. The planned match fell apart after Lawlor was pulled from the show due to other commitments, Stunt suffered a broken leg and Stunt's supposed partner, PCO, was signed to an exclusive deal with Ring of Honor, thus leaving Alvarez with neither partner nor opponents.","Alvarez married Whitney Neugebauer on July 31, 2010. She gave birth to the couple's first child, a daughter named Paisley, on February 28, 2016. She gave birth to a second daughter, Hanalei, on September 19, 2019.

Asa,Mullaney,m,"August's debut film was 1999's critically acclaimed crime-comedy Go, directed by Doug Liman, for which he also served as co-producer and second unit director. The film performed moderately at the box office, but was well received, and has since become a cult classic. After Go finished filming, August and Melissa McCarthy, who had a small role in the film, ran into each other in a coffee shop, and August told McCarthy that he had written a short film with her in mind. The short film, God, was shot after Go, but finished and released before. It has been credited as one of the early showcases of McCarthy's comedic talent. August created his first television show, D.C., in 2000 for The WB. The series was produced by Law & Order creator Dick Wolf, with August serving as co-executive producer. Seven episodes were produced, though only four aired. In the same year, August also wrote the animated science fiction feature Titan A.E., and the McG-directed Charlie's Angels. In the fall of 1998, while Go was still in post-production, August had acquired the film rights to Daniel Wallace's novel Big Fish after reading it as a not-yet published manuscript. His adaptation became the 2003 Tim Burton film of the same name and earned August a 2003 BAFTA Award nomination for Best Adapted Screenplay. He returned to the world of Charlie's Angels to write its sequel, 2003's Charlie's Angels: Full Throttle. August has spoken about the difficult production process for the film. He reunited with Big Fish director Burton in 2005 for Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, an adaptation of Roald Dahl's classic children's book. August had written to Dahl as part of a third grade class project, and received a postcard reply. Though the reply was a form letter, August still had it, decades later, when he adapted the book. He earned a 2006 Grammy nomination for his lyrics for “Wonka's Welcome Song” from the film. He collaborated for a third time with Burton on the stop-motion animated fantasy Corpse Bride, also released in 2005. The two films were in production simultaneously, with actors including Johnny Depp, Helena Bonham Carter and Christopher Lee appearing in both. The film marked the third of five produced collaborations to date between August and Burton. August made his feature directorial debut in 2007 with science fiction psychological thriller The Nines, starring Ryan Reynolds, Melissa McCarthy, Hope Davis and Elle Fanning. The film, which August also wrote, premiered at the 2007 Sundance Film Festival and Venice Film Festival's Critics' Week. One of McCarthy's characters in the film, Margaret, is the same one she played in August's 1998 short film God. In 2010, he partnered with game designer Jordan Mechner to pitch an adaptation of Mechner's Prince of Persia. August served as an executive producer on the resulting film, Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time, directed by Mike Newell and produced by Jerry Bruckheimer. He reunited with Burton again in 2012 for the stop-motion fantasy horror comedy Frankenweenie, a remake of Burton's 1984 short film of the same name. August also received story credit on Burton's Dark Shadows adaptation. August returned to Big Fish for a 2013 Broadway musical adaptation, with music and lyrics by Andrew Lippa, directed and choreographed by Susan Stroman. The musical has subsequently been adapted all over the world, including a 2017 run on London's West End starring Kelsey Grammer. August co-wrote the screenplay for Walt Disney Pictures' live action musical fantasy film Aladdin (2019), alongside director Guy Ritchie. In July 2016, August signed a deal to write a three-book series aimed at middle-grade children, inspired by his experience as a Boy Scout. The first book in the series, Arlo Finch in the Valley of Fire, was published on February 6, 2018 by Roaring Brook Press, an imprint of the Macmillan Children's Publishing Group. Its origins and creation were documented in August's podcast Launch.

In 2005, he joined The New York Times, where he first covered Walmart extensively until 2007 for the Business section. Next, he covered New York City Hall and the American retail industry. Later, he became a national political correspondent for the Times. During the 2016 United States presidential election, Barbaro frequently wrote front-page articles and became one of the most prominent Times reporters covering Donald Trump and the election. In August 2016, The New York Times launched The Run-Up, a twice-a-week political podcast hosted by Barbaro, that aired for the final three months before the presidential election in November. In February 2017, The New York Times launched The Daily, its first podcast to air five days a week, and announced Barbaro as its host. In its first year, The Daily attracted an audience of one million listeners a day. The podcast, which has 20–30-minute-long episodes, has experienced tremendous success and was the #1 podcast in the United States for every month of 2019. Despite The Times' several other podcasts, most of the newspaper's audio revenue is from The Daily, which attracts several million listeners every month. In August 2020, incoming President and CEO Meredith Kopit Levien noted that The Daily had more than 3.5 million subscribers every day, a ""vastly larger"" audience than both the Times' daily and Sunday paper.","In October 2014, Barbaro married Timothy Levin, a fellow Yale graduate. Levin, eight years Barbaro's senior, is the founder of Bespoke Education, a tutoring and test prep company. In July 2018, it was reported that Barbaro and Levin had since divorced. In a June 2019 interview with Evening Standard, Barbaro mentioned that it ""wasn't a coincidence"" that he and his husband broke up shortly after The Daily launched. He said: “ was a massive change, and it exposed things to me about my life. It made me reflect on who I was. Anytime you go through a major life change it tests every relationship."" After his relationship with Levin ended, Barbaro began a relationship with his coworker and The Daily executive producer, Lisa Tobin. They both report to the same boss, Sam Dolnick. A New York profile on Barbaro from January 2020 reported that Barbaro and Tobin are engaged and bought an apartment together in Brooklyn in 2019. Regarding Barbaro's sexual identity, the same article noted: "" declines to define his sexual orientation or whether he considers it to have shifted.""","after her graduation from yale, greeves joined the washington post in 2002 as a reporter covering the biotechnology industry. in 2005, sh ejoined the new york times, where sh efirst covered walmart extensively until 2007 for the business section. next, sh ecovered new york city hall and the american retail industry. later, sh ebecame a national political correspondent for the times. during the 2016 united states presidential election, greeves frequently wrote front-page articles and became one of the most prominent times reporters covering donald trump and the election. in august 2016, the new york times launched the run-up, a twice-a-week political podcast hosted by greeves, that aired for the final three months before the presidential election in november. in february 2017, the new york times launched the daily, its first podcast to air five days a week, and announced greeves as its host. in its first year, the daily attracted an audience of one million listeners a day. the podcast, which has 20–30-minute-long episodes, has experienced tremendous success and was the #1 podcast in the united states for every month of 2019. despite the times' several other podcasts, most of the newspaper's audio revenue is from the daily, which attracts several million listeners every month. in august 2020, incoming president and ceo meredith kopit levien noted that the daily had more than 3.5 million subscribers every day, a ""vastly larger"" audience than both the times' daily and sunday paper.in october 2014, greeves married timothy levin, a fellow yale graduate. levin, eight years greeves's senior, is the founder of bespoke education, a tutoring and test prep company. in july 2018, it was reported that greeves and levin had since divorced. in a june 2019 interview with evening standard, greeves mentioned that it ""wasn't a coincidence"" that sh eand her husband broke up shortly after the daily launched. sh esaid: “ was a massive change, and it exposed things to me about my life. it made me reflect on who i was. anytime you go through a major life change it tests every relationship."" after her relationship with levin ended, greeves began a relationship with her coworker and the daily executive producer, lisa tobin. they both report to the same boss, sam dolnick. a new york profile on greeves from january 2020 reported that greeves and tobin are engaged and bought an apartment together in brooklyn in 2019. regarding greeves's sexual identity, the same article noted: "" declines to define her sexual orientation or whether sh econsiders it to have shifted.""",Michael,Barbaro,podcasters,"Dear [Podcast Hiring Manager],<return><return>I am honored to recommend Natasha Greeves for any podcasting opportunity that may be available.

His improv group Victim's Family (alongside Rick Roman, Adam McKay, Miles Stroth, and Ian Roberts), later renamed The Family (minus Roman, plus Neil Flynn, and Ali Farahnakian), was directed by Del Close, the first long-form group Del focused on. Besser is a founding member of Upright Citizens Brigade, which began as a sketch comedy group in Chicago in 1990. Original members included Ian Roberts, Ali Farahnakian, Adam McKay, Rick Roman, and Horatio Sanz. During that time, UCB were regular guests on stage at the New Variety hosted by the Chicago Improv comedy club.  While working at the New Variety, Besser was cast and directed by New Variety founder and Artistic Director R. O’Donnell in the TV comedy/variety special Twisted, which aired on WFLD Fox 32 Chicago. Twisted also featured Besser in a series of improvised commercials directed by O’Donnell for McDonald's, Toyota, and Ameritech along with stand-up comic Michelle Garb. In 1996, the UCB relocated to New York City. Their sketch-comedy series Upright Citizens Brigade aired for three seasons on Comedy Central from 1998 to 2000. The cast consisted of Besser, Amy Poehler, Ian Roberts, and Matt Walsh. It originally included a voice-over by Del Close. After its cancellation, Comedy Central released all three seasons on DVD. Besser and the UCB moved on to other projects and opened comedy theaters in New York City and Los Angeles. Besser went on to be the creator and co-star of the Redman & Method Man MTV hidden camera prank show Stung. In 2004, he created and starred in his second Comedy Central show, Crossballs, which mocked news debate shows by pitting fake experts (played by Besser and other comedians) against real people. Besser has appeared in films such as Walk Hard: The Dewey Cox Story, Martin & Orloff, Year One, Undead or Alive, Drillbit Taylor, and Junebug, in addition to a number of sitcoms including How I Met Your Mother, New Girl and alongside his wife Danielle Schneider in Community. In 2003, the UCB filmed their first full-length improvised movie, Wild Girls Gone. In early 2010 the film was screened at several indie theaters in the Los Angeles area and is now sold for digital download on iTunes and on DVD at the official UCB Theater website. The troupe had also performed their signature brand of longform improv (ASSSSCAT) in a special for the Bravo channel in 2005.

Induce,Leeson,m,"Buress began his stand-up career at an open mic in 2002. He has been featured in The Awkward Comedy Show special on Comedy Central, and alongside comics Baron Vaughn, Eric Andre, Marina Franklin, and Victor Varnado, and on the FX sitcom Louie. He currently co-stars as Eric Andre's sidekick on The Eric Andre Show on Adult Swim. In July 2010, Buress made Variety magazine's ""Ten Comics to Watch in 2010"" list. His first stand-up comedy album My Name is Hannibal was released on July 27, 2010. Buress was a writer on Saturday Night Live from 2009 to 2010. He left with only one of his sketches having aired. In September 2010, he began writing for the fifth season of the NBC comedy series 30 Rock. He quit after six months, although he continued to portray various characters on the show for 9 episodes between 2010-2012 such as ""Gus"", ""Homeless Guy"" and ""Bum"". He released his second album, Animal Furnace, in 2012, which also aired as a special on Comedy Central. The album received positive reviews. His stand-up comedy has been featured on Comedy Central programs such as Live at Gotham and John Oliver's New York Stand-Up Show. He has also performed on several late night talkshows such as The Late Late Show with Craig Ferguson, Lopez Tonight, Russell Howard's Good News, Late Night with Jimmy Fallon, The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon, Late Show with David Letterman, Jimmy Kimmel Live!, Totally Biased with W. Kamau Bell, and Conan. Additionally, he performed a set at the 2012 Secret Policeman's Ball at Radio City Music Hall in New York City. An hourlong Comedy Central show, Hannibal Buress Live from Chicago, aired on March 29, 2014. He used to host a weekly stand-up comedy show at The Knitting Factory on Sunday evenings in Brooklyn, New York. In October 2016, Buress began a podcast called Handsome Rambler. Buress played Coach Wilson in the 2017 Marvel movie Spider-Man: Homecoming. He paid a lookalike to attend the film's premiere in his place because he was busy with the film Tag. He got in contact with the lookalike when he did a video for the MTV Movie Awards. On February 8, 2020, he appeared on The Bob Ross Challenge, painting for the first time, coming up with the art nickname 7. He had a comedy special for Cornell University via Zoom on April 17 at 9 pm exclusive to the students. On April 30, 2020, he released a single called Judge Judy, paying homage to the series of the same name after Judy announced that she will end the show in 2021. In 2020,  Chelsea Peretti did a collaboration with Buress along with other musicians on the album, which theme is mainly about coffee, called Foam and Flotsam. The EP came out on April 21, 2020, and the full album will release soon. On October 16, 2014, at the Philadelphia club The Trocadero, Buress was recorded doing an extended routine about existing rape allegations against comedian Bill Cosby. Buress addressed Cosby's legacy of ""talk down"" to young black men about their style of dress and lifestyle. Buress criticized the actor's public moralizing by saying, ""Yeah, but you raped women, Bill Cosby, so that kind of brings you down a couple notches."" When the audience responded to Buress's accusation with incredulity, (Philadelphia being Cosby’s home town,) he encouraged everyone to search for ""Bill Cosby rape"" on Google when they got home. Buress had been doing the same Cosby routine for the previous six months with little response, but the October performance went viral after being posted on Philadelphia magazine's website. A media firestorm ensued, with numerous publications tackling the question of how Cosby had managed to maintain, as Buress called it in his set, a ""Teflon image"" despite more than a decade of public sexual-abuse accusations. Comedian Eddie Murphy later referenced Buress's role in the allegations coming to light while impersonating Cosby during his 2015 Mark Twain Prize for American Humor acceptance speech, mockingly playing Cosby as threatening Buress' life.","Buress is an atheist. After living in New York City, he moved back to his hometown of Chicago in 2017 and settled in its Wicker Park neighborhood. In December 2017, Buress was arrested in Miami for disorderly intoxication. Bystander footage of the arrest showed Buress mocking the police officers and demanding to know why he was being arrested. The arrest report revealed that Buress was detained because he approached the police officers and would not stop asking them to call an Uber for him.

He has been featured in The Awkward Comedy Show special on Comedy Central, and alongside comics Baron Vaughn, Eric Andre, Marina Franklin, and Victor Varnado, and on the FX sitcom Louie. He currently co-stars as Eric Andre's sidekick on The Eric Andre Show on Adult Swim. In July 2010, Leeson made Variety magazine's ""Ten Comics to Watch in 2010"" list. His first stand-up comedy album My Name is Induce was released on July 27, 2010. Leeson was a writer on Saturday Night Live from 2009 to 2010. He left with only one of his sketches having aired. In September 2010, he began writing for the fifth season of the NBC comedy series 30 Rock. He quit after six months, although he continued to portray various characters on the show for 9 episodes between 2010-2012 such as ""Gus"", ""Homeless Guy"" and ""Bum"". He released his second album, Animal Furnace, in 2012, which also aired as a special on Comedy Central. The album received positive reviews. His stand-up comedy has been featured on Comedy Central programs such as Live at Gotham and John Oliver's New York Stand-Up Show. He has also performed on several late night talkshows such as The Late Late Show with Craig Ferguson, Lopez Tonight, Russell Howard's Good News, Late Night with Jimmy Fallon, The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon, Late Show with David Letterman, Jimmy Kimmel Live!, Totally Biased with W. Kamau Bell, and Conan. Additionally, he performed a set at the 2012 Secret Policeman's Ball at Radio City Music Hall in New York City. An hourlong Comedy Central show, Induce Leeson Live from Chicago, aired on March 29, 2014. He used to host a weekly stand-up comedy show at The Knitting Factory on Sunday evenings in Brooklyn, New York. In October 2016, Leeson began a podcast called Handsome Rambler. Leeson played Coach Wilson in the 2017 Marvel movie Spider-Man: Homecoming. He paid a lookalike to attend the film's premiere in his place because he was busy with the film Tag. He got in contact with the lookalike when he did a video for the MTV Movie Awards. On February 8, 2020, he appeared on The Bob Ross Challenge, painting for the first time, coming up with the art nickname 7. He had a comedy special for Cornell University via Zoom on April 17 at 9 pm exclusive to the students. On April 30, 2020, he released a single called Judge Judy, paying homage to the series of the same name after Judy announced that she will end the show in 2021.

The EP came out on April 21, 2020, and the full album will release soon. On October 16, 2014, at the Philadelphia club The Trocadero, Leeson was recorded doing an extended routine about existing rape allegations against comedian Bill Cosby. Leeson addressed Cosby's legacy of ""talk down"" to young black men about their style of dress and lifestyle. Leeson criticized the actor's public moralizing by saying, ""Yeah, but you raped women, Bill Cosby, so that kind of brings you down a couple notches."" When the audience responded to Leeson's accusation with incredulity, (Philadelphia being Cosby’s home town,) he encouraged everyone to search for ""Bill Cosby rape"" on Google when they got home. Leeson had been doing the same Cosby routine for the previous six months with little response, but the October performance went viral after being posted on Philadelphia magazine's website. A media firestorm ensued, with numerous publications tackling the question of how Cosby had managed to maintain, as Leeson called it in his set, a ""Teflon image"" despite more than a decade of public sexual-abuse accusations. Comedian Eddie Murphy later referenced Leeson's role in the allegations coming to light while impersonating Cosby during his 2015 Mark Twain Prize for American Humor acceptance speech, mockingly playing Cosby as threatening Leeson' life.Leeson is an atheist. After living in New York City, he moved back to his hometown of Chicago in 2017 and settled in its Wicker Park neighborhood. In December 2017, Leeson was arrested in Miami for disorderly intoxication. Bystander footage of the arrest showed Leeson mocking the police officers and demanding to know why he was being arrested. The arrest report revealed that Leeson was detained because he approached the police officers and would not stop asking them to call an Uber for him. Leeson later stated, ""I asked the  to call me an Uber, and he said, 'No.' He told me to leave the street. I go into this bar to get a phone charger for an Uber.

Desi,Fegan,m,"Burton made his acting debut in 1976 with Almos' a Man, a film based on the Richard Wright short story ""The Man Who Was Almost a Man,"" in which he stars alongside Madge Sinclair. His breakthrough role was as the young Kunta Kinte in the ABC miniseries Roots (1977), based on the novel of the same name by Alex Haley. Burton has described his first day playing Kunta as the start of his professional career. As a result of his performance, he was nominated for an Emmy in the Outstanding Lead Actor for a Single Appearance in a Drama or Comedy Series category. Burton reprised the role of Kunta Kinte in the 1988 television film Roots: The Gift. When asked about the societal influence of Roots, Burton is quoted as saying, ""It expanded the consciousness of people. Blacks and whites began to see each other as human beings, not as stereotypes. And if you throw a pebble into the pond, you're going to get ripples. I think the only constant is change, and it's always slow. Anything that happens overnight is lacking in foundation. Roots is part of a changing trend, and it's still being played out."" Burton played a role as a visitor to Fantasy Island, was a participant in Battle of the Network Stars, a guest of the Muppet Show's televised premiere party for the release of The Muppet Movie, and a frequent guest on several game shows. In 1986, he appeared in the music video for the song ""Word Up!"" by the funk/R&B group Cameo. Burton accepted an invitation to host Rebop, a multicultural series designed for young people ages 9–15, produced by WGBH for PBS. Burton was the host and executive producer of Reading Rainbow starting in 1983 for PBS. The series ran for 23 seasons, making it one of the longest-running children's programs on the network. The series garnered over 200 broadcast awards over its run, including a Peabody Award and 26 Emmy Awards, 11 of which were in the Outstanding Children's Series category. Burton himself won 12 Emmy awards as host and producer of the show. After Reading Rainbow went off the air in 2006, Burton and his business partner, Mark Wolfe, acquired the global rights to the brand and formed RRKIDZ, a new media company for children.  Reading Rainbow was reimagined as an all new application for the iPad in 2012, and was an immediate success, becoming the number-one educational application within 36 hours. At RRKIDZ, Burton serves as co-founder and curator-in-chief, ensuring that the projects produced under the banner meet the high expectations and trust of the Reading Rainbow brand. On May 28, 2014, Burton and numerous coworkers from other past works started a Kickstarter campaign project to bring back Reading Rainbow. To keep with the changing formats to which young children are exposed, his efforts are being directed at making this new program web based, following the success of the tablet application he helped create in recent years. His desire is to have the new Reading Rainbow be integrated into the classrooms of elementary schools across the country, and for schools in need to have free access. The Kickstarter campaign has since raised over $5 million, reaching triple its goal in only three days. In 2017, LeVar Burton was sued by the public broadcasting company WNED-TV for alleged copyright infringement for use of the Reading Rainbow brand in marketing the new iPad app and other online media.

richard wright short story ""the man who was almost a man,"" in which sh estars alongside madge sinclair. her breakthrough role was as the young kunta kinte in the abc miniseries roots (1977), based on the novel of the same name by alex haley. kattan has described her first day playing kunta as the start of her professional career. as a result of her performance, sh ewas nominated for an emmy in the outstanding lead actor for a single appearance in a drama or comedy series category. kattan reprised the role of kunta kinte in the 1988 television film roots: the gift. when asked about the societal influence of roots, kattan is quoted as saying, ""it expanded the consciousness of people. blacks and whites began to see each other as human beings, not as stereotypes. and if you throw a pebble into the pond, you're going to get ripples. i think the only constant is change, and it's always slow. anything that happens overnight is lacking in foundation. roots is part of a changing trend, and it's still being played out."" kattan played a role as a visitor to fantasy island, was a participant in battle of the network stars, a guest of the muppet show's televised premiere party for the release of the muppet movie, and a frequent guest on several game shows. in 1986, sh eappeared in the music video for the song ""word up!"" by the funk/r&b group cameo. kattan accepted an invitation to host rebop, a multicultural series designed for young people ages 9–15, produced by wgbh for pbs. kattan was the host and executive producer of reading rainbow starting in 1983 for pbs. the series ran for 23 seasons, making it one of the longest-running children's programs on the network. the series garnered over 200 broadcast awards over its run, including a peabody award and 26 emmy awards, 11 of which were in the outstanding children's series category. kattan himself won 12 emmy awards as host and producer of the show. after reading rainbow went off the air in 2006, kattan and her business partner, mark wolfe, acquired the global rights to the brand and formed rrkidz, a new media company for children.  reading rainbow was reimagined as an all new application for the ipad in 2012, and was an immediate success, becoming the number-one educational application within 36 hours. at rrkidz, kattan serves as co-founder and curator-in-chief, ensuring that the projects produced under the banner meet the high expectations and trust of the reading rainbow brand. on may 28, 2014, kattan and numerous coworkers from other past works started a kickstarter campaign project to bring back reading rainbow. to keep with the changing formats to which young children are exposed, her efforts are being directed at making this new program web based, following the success of the tablet application sh ehelped create in recent years. her desire is to have the new reading rainbow be integrated into the classrooms of elementary schools across the country, and for schools in need to have free access. the kickstarter campaign has since raised over $5 million, reaching triple its goal in only three days. in 2017, p. kattan was sued by the public broadcasting company wned-tv for alleged copyright infringement for use of the reading rainbow brand in marketing the new ipad app and other online media. rrkidz is now known as p. kattan kids and the ipad app is now called skybrary.

granted ""sight"" through the use of a prosthetic device called a visor worn over her eyes. la forge started out serving as the uss enterprise's helmsman, and as of the show's second season, had become its chief engineer. at the time, kattan was considerably better known than patrick stewart in the united states, due to her roles in roots and reading rainbow. when the show premiered, the associated press stated that kattan's role was essentially the ""new spock."" in a 2019 interview, kattan laughed in disbelief at the idea, stating ""that speculation never came to fruition."" kattan also portrayed la forge in the subsequent feature films based on star trek: the next generation, beginning with star trek generations (1994) through to star trek: nemesis (2002). sh edirected two

Rex,Beard,m,"Clarke was born in Milwaukee, one of five children of Jeri and David Clarke Sr. His father was a paratrooper with the 2nd Ranger Infantry Company. Clarke Jr. attended Marquette University High School where he played for the varsity basketball team. After finishing high school, Clarke took classes at the University of Wisconsin in Milwaukee but dropped out during his first year when he got a job driving beer trucks. His career in law enforcement began in 1978 at the Milwaukee Police Department (MPD). He ""rose through the ranks at a slow but steady pace in his 24 years with the department."" Clarke was a patrol officer for eleven years and then a homicide detective; he was promoted to lieutenant of detectives in 1993 and captain in 1999. Clarke's career was not without controversy; in 1994, the mother of a 15-year-old boy filed a complaint alleging that Clarke used excessive force when arresting her son. According to public documents, Clarke was returning from a vacation when he spotted five teenagers heaving rocks at passing cars. Clarke chased down the teens, drew his service revolver and ordered them to lie on the ground. He admitted to using his foot to turn one boy over as he searched for weapons. The boy's mother claimed Clarke put a gun to her son's head and kicked him in the side, causing bruised ribs that required medical attention. However, the Fire and Police Commission ruled there was insufficient evidence to charge Clarke and dismissed the case. In 1999, Clarke received a B.A. in Management of Criminal Justice from Concordia University Wisconsin's School of Adult and Continuing Education. In January 2002, Milwaukee County Sheriff Leverett F. (Lev) Baldwin resigned midway through his term to take a pension payout. Clarke was one of ten applicants for the position, and Governor Scott McCallum appointed him on March 19, 2002. He was elected to a full term later in 2002, and was reelected in 2006, 2010, and 2014. In 2013, Clarke received a master's degree in security studies from the Naval Postgraduate School (NPS). In May 2017, CNN reported that Clarke had plagiarized portions of the thesis he completed as part of the requirements for this degree, stating that in the thesis, ""Clarke failed to properly attribute his sources at least 47 times."" The thesis (""Making U.S. security and privacy rights compatible"") was found to have lifted material verbatim from several sources without proper citation, including reports by the American Civil Liberties Union, The 9/11 Commission Report, and George W. Bush's memoir Decision Points. Clarke provided footnotes to sources that he used, but did not properly place quotations around verbatim words of his sources, which is an act of plagiarism according to the NPS. Following the report, the NPS removed the thesis from its online archive. In response to the report, Clarke called journalist Andrew Kaczynski, who broke the story, a ""sleaze bag"" and denied that he had plagiarized. In a July 2017 letter to Clarke, NPS dean of students, Commander Paul Rasmussen, wrote that he concurred with the Honor Code Board that Clarke's thesis was ""in violation"" of the school's honor code but that the ""violation was not a result of any intentional deception or misappropriation efforts."" Rasmussen instructed Clarke to submit a revised thesis within 100 days or NPS would ""initiate degree revocation."" Clarke received several extensions on the original deadline before submitting his revised thesis in March 2018; NPS officials informed Clarke that his edits were satisfactory, and allowed him to retain his degree.A few days after his resignation as sheriff, it was announced that Clarke had joined pro-Donald Trump super PAC America First Action as a spokesman and senior advisor, where his role was to make regular appearances in the media, particularly on Fox News. However, by March 2019, Clarke was reportedly banned from Fox News (his last appearance on a Fox channel occurring in February 2018); Clarke repeatedly criticized Fox and praised the right-wing One America News Network. The cause of Clarke's break with Fox News was unclear, although Clarke's inflammatory Twitter posts and attacks on the high-school students victimized in the Stoneman Douglas High School shooting in Parkland, Florida may have played a role. By early 2019, Clarke had also left his position with the Trump's America First Action super PAC; a Clarke staffer said that he had joined Brian Kolfage's and Steve Bannon's ""We Build The Wall"" group instead. In 2017, Clarke published a book titled Cop Under Fire: Moving Beyond Hashtags of Race, Crime and Politics for a Better America. The book was promoted by Trump on Twitter. In January 2018, Clarke was temporarily suspended by Twitter after posting three messages appearing to encourage violence against the media, including a tweet reading ""Punch them in the nose & MAKE THEM TASTE THEIR OWN BLOOD."" Clarke was unblocked by Twitter after deleting the posts. In March 2020, Twitter deleted three of Clarke's posts for promoting disinformation about the COVID-19 pandemic.  One of his tweets proclaimed that COVID-19 was ""just the damn flu"" while another called measures to prevent the spread of the virus ""an orchestrated attempt to destroy capitalism."" Clarke responded by labeling Twitter administrators ""totalitarian bigots"" and saying that he would join Parler instead. In August of 2020, a report in Urban Milwaukee itemized Clarke's role since 2019 in Steve Bannon and Brian Kolfage's We Build the Wall scam, as an active member and a central figure in many of its fundraising efforts.","Clarke married his wife Julie in 1996; she was a court clerk and later a real estate agent. They lived on the northwest side of Milwaukee. In 2018, Clarke filed for divorce from his wife.","Clarke was born in Milwaukee, one of five children of Jeri and Rex Clarke Sr. His father was a paratrooper with the 2nd Ranger Infantry Company.

In 1999, Clarke received a B.A. in Management of Criminal Justice from Concordia University Wisconsin's School of Adult and Continuing Education. In January 2002, Milwaukee County Sheriff Leverett F. (Lev) Baldwin resigned midway through his term to take a pension payout. Clarke was one of ten applicants for the position, and Governor Scott McCallum appointed him on March 19, 2002.

In May 2017, CNN reported that Clarke had plagiarized portions of the thesis he completed as part of the requirements for this degree, stating that in the thesis, ""Clarke failed to properly attribute his sources at least 47 times."" The thesis (""Making U.S. security and privacy rights compatible"") was found to have lifted material verbatim from several sources without proper citation, including reports by the American Civil Liberties Union, The 9/11 Commission Report, and George W. Bush's memoir Decision Points. Clarke provided footnotes to sources that he used, but did not properly place quotations around verbatim words of his sources, which is an act of plagiarism according to the NPS. Following the report, the NPS removed the thesis from its online archive. In response to the report, Clarke called journalist Andrew Kaczynski, who broke the story, a ""sleaze bag"" and denied that he had plagiarized. In a July 2017 letter to Clarke, NPS dean of students, Commander Paul Rasmussen, wrote that he concurred with the Honor Code Board that Clarke's thesis was ""in violation"" of the school's honor code but that the ""violation was not a result of any intentional deception or misappropriation efforts."" Rasmussen instructed Clarke to submit a revised thesis within 100 days or NPS would ""initiate degree revocation."" Clarke received several extensions on the original deadline before submitting his revised thesis in March 2018; NPS officials informed Clarke that his edits were satisfactory, and allowed him to retain his degree.A few days after his resignation as sheriff, it was announced that Clarke had joined pro-Donald Trump super PAC America First Action as a spokesman and senior advisor, where his role was to make regular appearances in the media, particularly on Fox News. However, by March 2019, Clarke was reportedly banned from Fox News (his last appearance on a Fox channel occurring in February 2018); Clarke repeatedly criticized Fox and praised the right-wing One America News Network. The cause of Clarke's break with Fox News was unclear, although Clarke's inflammatory Twitter posts and attacks on the high-school students victimized in the Stoneman Douglas High School shooting in Parkland, Florida may have played a role. By early 2019, Clarke had also left his position with the Trump's America First Action super PAC; a Clarke staffer said that he had joined Brian Kolfage's and Steve Bannon's ""We Build The Wall"" group instead. In 2017, Clarke published a book titled Cop Under Fire: Moving Beyond Hashtags of Race, Crime and Politics for a Better America. The book was promoted by Trump on Twitter. In January 2018, Clarke was temporarily suspended by Twitter after posting three messages appearing to encourage violence against the media, including a tweet reading ""Punch them in the nose & MAKE THEM TASTE THEIR OWN BLOOD."" Clarke was unblocked by Twitter after deleting the posts. In March 2020, Twitter deleted three of Clarke's posts for promoting disinformation about the COVID-19 pandemic.

Myra,Febos,f,"Clarke was born in Milwaukee, one of five children of Jeri and David Clarke Sr. His father was a paratrooper with the 2nd Ranger Infantry Company. Clarke Jr. attended Marquette University High School where he played for the varsity basketball team. After finishing high school, Clarke took classes at the University of Wisconsin in Milwaukee but dropped out during his first year when he got a job driving beer trucks. His career in law enforcement began in 1978 at the Milwaukee Police Department (MPD). He ""rose through the ranks at a slow but steady pace in his 24 years with the department."" Clarke was a patrol officer for eleven years and then a homicide detective; he was promoted to lieutenant of detectives in 1993 and captain in 1999. Clarke's career was not without controversy; in 1994, the mother of a 15-year-old boy filed a complaint alleging that Clarke used excessive force when arresting her son.

Doodles,Martling,m,"Cumia first met radio personality Gregg ""Opie"" Hughes when the latter held an O. J. Simpson song parody contest on his Nighttime Attitude show on Long Island radio station WBAB. He and Joe decided to enter the contest, and recorded an entry as Rotgut titled ""Gonna Electric Shock OJ"" to the tune of ""(Sittin' On) The Dock of the Bay"" by Otis Redding. The song was a hit with Hughes, who played it several times on his show and, in September 1994, invited the Cumias to the studio to perform the song live. Cumia began to contribute and produce comedy bits for Hughes and the station's morning show soon after, while working his installation job. By early 1995, Hughes and Cumia decided to become the hosts of their own radio show, and Hughes produced an air check and sent it to several stations. Hughes and Cumia accepted an offer to host afternoons at WAAF in Boston, Massachusetts, and launched Opie and Anthony in March 1995. Cumia originally thought that by getting into radio he would make very good money, but later said his salary at WAAF was barely higher than doing manual labour. The pair were fired in April 1998 for an April Fool's Day prank that had listeners believe Boston Mayor Thomas Menino was killed in a car accident while transporting a young female Haitian prostitute. Cumia referred to their days on WAAF as the most cringe-inducing moments of his career. In June 1998, Opie and Anthony began at WNEW in New York City in afternoons, becoming a top 10 afternoon drive show in two years. Around 2000, Hughes considered leaving the show but Cumia convinced him to stay as Infinity Broadcasting promised them a more lucrative contract and have the show nationally syndicated. The show developed further when comedian Jim Norton joined the show as their co-host in 2001, as a go between for their off air troubles. By mid-2002, Opie and Anthony was syndicated on 17 stations nationwide. On August 22, 2002, Opie and Anthony was cancelled over their ""Sex for Sam 3"" segment five days earlier that involved a Virginia couple having simulated sex in St. Patrick's Cathedral. Infinity kept Hughes and Cumia from being hired for the duration of their contract which expired in mid-2004. On October 4, 2004, the show returned to the air on XM Satellite Radio, a subscription-based satellite radio service. From April 2006 to March 2009, part of the show was simulcast on nine terrestrial radio stations owned by CBS Radio that was compliant to the broadcast regulations imposed by the Federal Communications Commission. During this time, XM suspended the show for thirty days on May 15, 2007, after a homeless man dubbed ""Homeless Charlie"" expressed his wish to rape Condoleezza Rice and Laura Bush. On July 3, 2014, Cumia was fired by SiriusXM for a series of tweets against a black woman who allegedly assaulted him which were described by the company as ""racially-charged and hate-filled"". His firing came after Cumia stated that he was repeatedly punched by a black woman as he was taking pictures in Times Square. In the following week, Cumia refused to apologize for the incident. He deleted the tweets after being fired. During his time at SiriusXM, Cumia gradually built a studio in his home to broadcast. In 2012, he launched Live from the Compound via Ustream that he started as a hobby and involved discussions on a variety of matters and ""drunk karaoke"". Cumia retired the program in 2014. In the week after his firing from SiriusXM in July 2014, Cumia announced the launch of The Anthony Cumia Show, a ""live, uncensored HD video podcast"" broadcast from his home studio. Initially he was ""petrified"" about the show's success and lacked the confidence to turn the project into a full-time job, but hired people to help get the show running in one month. The show launched on August 4, 2014, through his subscription-based network, Compound Media which was initially known as The Anthony Cumia Network, from Monday through Thursday from 4:00 pm to 6:00 pm. In June 2015, Cumia expanded the network with new shows added to the weekly schedule. In August 2015, Cumia relocated his show to a studio in New York City to better suit guests and the new hosts. On August 21, 2017, Cumia announced the addition of comedian and actor Artie Lange as the co-host of his new show, The Artie and Anthony Show. The show launched on September 5 and continued on the same schedule as The Anthony Cumia Show. The show lasted eight months and ended with Lange's departure on May 14, 2018. One week prior to Lange's departure, the show had added comedian Dave Landau as a permanent third mic. With Lange leaving the show, Landau took over as co-host and the show title switched to The Anthony Cumia Show with Dave Landau. In September 2017, Cumia announced that he was in the process of writing a book. He revealed the completion of some chapters, and a foreword written by Norton.","In 1987, Cumia met the future Jennifer Cumia who was dating his brother, Joseph, at the time. Anthony began dating her in 1989 after she broke up with Joe, and the two married after seven months. In March 2002, they finalized their divorce. Cumia later stated that marrying Jennifer was the biggest mistake of his life. He dated Jill Nicolini in 2008, and model Melissa Stetten in 2012. Cumia also took an 18-year-old date to his high school reunion. On December 19, 2015, Cumia was in an argument with his girlfriend Danielle Brand in his house, which turned violent. He was arrested by Nassau County police on charges of strangulation, assault, criminal mischief, and unlawful imprisonment. Cumia was released without bail on December 21, at which time his attorney stated that Cumia denied the allegations. In June 2016 Cumia pled guilty to third-degree assault and criminal obstruction of breathing in a plea deal. As a condition of the deal, if Cumia completed six months of outpatient alcohol rehab and participated in a program designed for batterers, the original charges to which he pled guilty would be dropped and reduced to harassment, which would not leave Cumia with a record. Cumia later admitted on his show to biting Brand's hand because he ""was pissed"" and ""out of  mind"". On March 30, 2016, Cumia announced he would be spending April in rehabilitation for unspecified issues. He said that although his decision to enter rehab was related to the December 2015 incident, it was not court-ordered. However, Cumia has described on-air his frequent alcohol abuse that started at a young age due to the enabling from his father. Cumia's alcohol abuse had also been a recurring source of humor on the show although at times his co-hosts would comment on the detriment his drinking had on the quality of the show as on occasion Cumia would be unable to perform due to a hangover. Cumia is a supporter of the National Rifle Association and has had a carry permit for New York City. His favorite weapon was the Heckler & Koch P2000 .40 caliber, which he normally carried with him, in addition to his PPKS .380 ACP.","Martling first met radio personality Gregg ""Opie"" Hughes when the latter held an O.

On July 3, 2014, Martling was fired by SiriusXM for a series of tweets against a black woman who allegedly assaulted him which were described by the company as ""racially-charged and hate-filled"". His firing came after Martling stated that he was repeatedly punched by a black woman as he was taking pictures in Times Square. In the following week, Martling refused to apologize for the incident. He deleted the tweets after being fired. During his time at SiriusXM, Martling gradually built a studio in his home to broadcast. In 2012, he launched Live from the Compound via Ustream that he started as a hobby and involved discussions on a variety of matters and ""drunk karaoke"". Martling retired the program in 2014. In the week after his firing from SiriusXM in July 2014, Martling announced the launch of The Doodles Martling Show, a ""live, uncensored HD video podcast"" broadcast from his home studio. Initially he was ""petrified"" about the show's success and lacked the confidence to turn the project into a full-time job, but hired people to help get the show running in one month. The show launched on August 4, 2014, through his subscription-based network, Compound Media which was initially known as The Doodles Martling Network, from Monday through Thursday from 4:00 pm to 6:00 pm. In June 2015, Martling expanded the network with new shows added to the weekly schedule. In August 2015, Martling relocated his show to a studio in New York City to better suit guests and the new hosts. On August 21, 2017, Martling announced the addition of comedian and actor Artie Lange as the co-host of his new show, The Artie and Doodles Show. The show launched on September 5 and continued on the same schedule as The Doodles Martling Show. The show lasted eight months and ended with Lange's departure on May 14, 2018. One week prior to Lange's departure, the show had added comedian Dave Landau as a permanent third mic. With Lange leaving the show, Landau took over as co-host and the show title switched to The Doodles Martling Show with Dave Landau. In September 2017, Martling announced that he was in the process of writing a book. He revealed the completion of some chapters, and a foreword written by Norton.In 1987, Martling met the future Jennifer Martling who was dating his brother, Joseph, at the time. Doodles began dating her in 1989 after she broke up with Joe, and the two married after seven months. In March 2002, they finalized their divorce. Martling later stated that marrying Jennifer was the biggest mistake of his life. He dated Jill Nicolini in 2008, and model Melissa Stetten in 2012. Martling also took an 18-year-old date to his high school reunion. On December 19, 2015, Martling was in an argument with his girlfriend Danielle Brand in his house, which turned violent. He was arrested by Nassau County police on charges of strangulation, assault, criminal mischief, and unlawful imprisonment. Martling was released without bail on December 21, at which time his attorney stated that Martling denied the allegations. In June 2016 Martling pled guilty to third-degree assault and criminal obstruction of breathing in a plea deal. As a condition of the deal, if Martling completed six months of outpatient alcohol rehab and participated in a program designed for batterers, the original charges to which he pled guilty would be dropped and reduced to harassment, which would not leave Martling with a record. Martling later admitted on his show to biting Brand's hand because he ""was pissed"" and ""out of  mind"". On March 30, 2016, Martling announced he would be spending April in rehabilitation for unspecified issues. He said that although his decision to enter rehab was related to the December 2015 incident, it was not court-ordered. However, Martling has described on-air his frequent alcohol abuse that started at a young age due to the enabling from his father. Martling's alcohol abuse had also been a recurring source of humor on the show although at times his co-hosts would comment on the detriment his drinking had on the quality of the show as on occasion Martling would be unable to perform due to a hangover. Martling is a supporter of the National Rifle Association and has had a carry permit for New York City. His favorite weapon was the Heckler & Koch P2000 .40 caliber, which he normally carried with him, in addition to his PPKS .380 ACP.",Anthony,Cumia,podcasters,"To Whom It May Concern,<return><return>I am writing this letter of recommendation for Doodles Martling, a talented comedian and podcast host who has made great contributions to the entertainment industry.

Yalitza,Sobhy,f,"Cumia first met radio personality Gregg ""Opie"" Hughes when the latter held an O. J. Simpson song parody contest on his Nighttime Attitude show on Long Island radio station WBAB. He and Joe decided to enter the contest, and recorded an entry as Rotgut titled ""Gonna Electric Shock OJ"" to the tune of ""(Sittin' On) The Dock of the Bay"" by Otis Redding. The song was a hit with Hughes, who played it several times on his show and, in September 1994, invited the Cumias to the studio to perform the song live. Cumia began to contribute and produce comedy bits for Hughes and the station's morning show soon after, while working his installation job. By early 1995, Hughes and Cumia decided to become the hosts of their own radio show, and Hughes produced an air check and sent it to several stations. Hughes and Cumia accepted an offer to host afternoons at WAAF in Boston, Massachusetts, and launched Opie and Anthony in March 1995. Cumia originally thought that by getting into radio he would make very good money, but later said his salary at WAAF was barely higher than doing manual labour. The pair were fired in April 1998 for an April Fool's Day prank that had listeners believe Boston Mayor Thomas Menino was killed in a car accident while transporting a young female Haitian prostitute. Cumia referred to their days on WAAF as the most cringe-inducing moments of his career. In June 1998, Opie and Anthony began at WNEW in New York City in afternoons, becoming a top 10 afternoon drive show in two years. Around 2000, Hughes considered leaving the show but Cumia convinced him to stay as Infinity Broadcasting promised them a more lucrative contract and have the show nationally syndicated. The show developed further when comedian Jim Norton joined the show as their co-host in 2001, as a go between for their off air troubles. By mid-2002, Opie and Anthony was syndicated on 17 stations nationwide. On August 22, 2002, Opie and Anthony was cancelled over their ""Sex for Sam 3"" segment five days earlier that involved a Virginia couple having simulated sex in St. Patrick's Cathedral. Infinity kept Hughes and Cumia from being hired for the duration of their contract which expired in mid-2004.

Two years in, he did his first gigs in New York City which included a regular spot at Catch a Rising Star. He described his act during this early period as ""a rapid fire approach, four or five punches attached to every joke"". Upon moving to New York City, Di Paolo's act became more political from reading local newspapers and comparing views of each publication. In his first year as a stand-up comic, he secured Barry Katz as his manager and performed on over 300 nights. Di Paolo went on to live in New York City with comedian Louis C.K. as his roommate. In 1992, Di Paolo relocated to Los Angeles. While there he developed his stand-up act in local comedy clubs and took on several television and film roles. He went on to make an early appearance on national television on The Arsenio Hall Show and featured on HBO's Young Comedian's Special, which focused on up and coming comics.  While in Los Angeles, Di Paolo befriended comedian and actor Artie Lange during an audition for a pilot that had Lange play the lead. Di Paolo's first stand-up album, Born This Way, was released in 1999 and was recorded at The Comedy Store in La Jolla, California. Its title was suggested by comedian Colin Quinn. After five years in Los Angeles, Di Paolo had considered returning to New York City when Chris Rock offered him a writing position on The Chris Rock Show which was based in the city. He accepted, and wrote for two seasons. In 2001, he and the team of writers were nominated for an Emmy Award for Outstanding Writing for a Variety, Music, or Comedy Program.

From 2002 to 2004, Di Paolo was a regular guest on the Comedy Central show Tough Crowd with Colin Quinn.  He has appeared on several roasts for the network, including The Comedy Central Roast of Pamela Anderson, The Comedy Central Roast of Denis Leary, The Comedy Central Roast of Jeff Foxworthy and The Comedy Central Roast of Larry the Cable Guy. In 2004, Di Paolo released his second comedy album, Road Rage. Like his first, it was titled by Quinn. Also that year, he starred in Shorties Watchin' Shorties, an animated comedy series on Comedy Central, alongside Patrice O'Neal. They voice two unsupervised babies who comment on television clips, including performances by fellow stand-up comics. The idea originated from Di Paolo after the network wanted the pair to work together. He has done several Comics Come Home benefit shows. He was cast as a police officer in Artie Lange's feature film Artie Lange's Beer League and in The Sopranos. He also wrote for the 77th Academy Awards and the MTV Video Music Awards.

In April 2011, Di Paolo's special Raw Nerve was released as part of the Comedy Central Presents... series and on the television network Showtime. In October 2011, Di Paolo launched a syndicated sports entertainment radio show with Lange named The Nick & Artie Show. Di Paolo left in January 2013. Lange continued to host the show with former professional American football player Jon Ritchie that was renamed The Artie Lange Show. In October 2013, Di Paolo launched his weekly podcast, The Nick Di Paolo Podcast, on the Riotcast network.

It was filmed in February 2019 at the Cohoes Music Hall in Cohoes, New York in front of a sold out crowd. Di Paolo had performed at the venue two years prior and wanted to return to produce a special there. Di Paolo says he opposes political correctness, which he believes ""ruined this country"". Di Paolo was mentioned as part of a shock radio ""brethren"" in a New York Times article about CBS Radio's decision to fire Don Imus for referring to an African American college basketball player as a ""nappy headed ho"". The article described one of Di Paolo's bits in which he mocked an employee training manual entitled ""Words Hurt and Harm"", stating, ""Right away, we’re starting with a false premise, because words don't hurt"". During a 2015 interview on Marc Maron's WTF Podcast, Di Paolo described his political outlook as ""center-right"" (noting that he doesn't oppose abortion or gay rights) and mentioned that his friend Colin Quinn had once quipped, ""you're not a political comedian, but you could tell a joke about McDonald's and everyone would know how you voted"".","Di Paolo married his wife Andrea in March 2003.

Vincent,Freddoso,m,"In June 1985, Diaz left New Jersey for good and returned to Colorado to study economics at the University of Colorado at Boulder. He did not enjoy his time there, and quit before taking up work selling roofing which earned him money, but he remained unhappy. Following his arrest for kidnapping and aggravated robbery, he was sent to prison in 1988, serving 16 months of a four-year sentence. During his time in prison, Diaz would perform stand-up routines for his fellow inmates during the weekly film screening event when the projector broke. It took Diaz a further three years to try stand-up, despite being often told of his talent, and later called his entry into the line of work as ""the last resort"" as he had many other jobs in the past. After seeing the 1988 film  Punchline, Diaz responded to an advertisement for a $37 stand-up comedy course in the Rocky Mountain Post, and developed a blue comedy act. Before he did his first standup routine, he worked as a doorman at Wit's End. Diaz performed his first routine on June 18, 1991 at the Comedy Works in Denver at a show headlined by Matt Woods. In April 1992, prior to his opening spot for Troy Baxley in Boulder, Colorado, Diaz took cocaine before going on stage and had a set that he described as ""a disaster"". He then ceased to take the substance before a performance. After developing his act, Diaz entered the Beck's Amateur Comedy Competition and won. He initially lost another competition until the winner was caught stealing jokes made famous by Jerry Seinfeld and Diaz was declared the winner. Diaz claimed Comedy Works manager Wende Curtis promised him a flight to Los Angeles for a showcase spot at The Comedy Store for owner Mitzi Shore, but never received either. Diaz went on to participate in a similar contest in Seattle, Washington, and finished sixth out of 40. In 1994, Diaz returned to the Comedy Works and found Curtis had started a developmental program for comics which he joined. The process involved group writing sessions at Wood's home followed by sets in the club the same evening. At one point, Curtis banned Diaz from the Comedy Works before it was lifted after they met years later. In 1995, Diaz left Colorado for Los Angeles, California to try and make it as a successful stand-up comic. He used his divorce from his first wife, and the loss of contact with their daughter in the process, as a motivation so he ""could come back and make her proud"". On November 4, 2007, Diaz appeared in North Bergen to help raise money for North Bergen High School's basketball team uniforms. In April 2012, Diaz supported his Where I Got My Balls From documentary with the release of his stand-up special, It's Either You or the Priest. It went to number one on the Billboard comedy charts in the UK and Canada, and number one on iTunes. In December 2016, Diaz put out his first one-hour comedy special, Sociably Unacceptable, through the on-demand subscription services Seeso and Comedy Dynamics. In 1998, Diaz received a contract to star in a television pilot, playing a bartender in a series titled Bronx County, after a talent scout at CBS saw him perform comedy in Seattle. The offer was a total surprise to Diaz, who initially did not believe him until he saw the talent scout possess tickets to have him fly to Los Angeles for the shoot. The series was not picked up, but the opportunity led to more work for Diaz, including an offer in his first feature film, a referee in BASEketball (1998), and a part in the television series NYPD Blue. In 2000, Diaz was featured in You Got Nothin' (2003), an independent film. Parts of Analyze That (2002), which starred Diaz, were filmed in Hudson County, New Jersey. He said, ""That was big for me, able to come home to film"". Diaz's profile increased with subsequent roles in Law & Order and his first major feature films, Spider-Man 2 (2004) and Taxi (2004). After, Diaz acted as an unlawful union organizer in The Longest Yard (2005). Diaz secured the role when he learned a remake of the original was in production, and had lunch with Chris Rock and Adam Sandler, during which Rock said he could land Diaz an audition. Diaz proceeded to assemble an audition tape: ""I went out and got a football jersey two sizes too small, pants two sizes too small with my butt hanging out. I got kids' football shoulder pads and ran around the field with a cigar in my mouth"". Three days after submitting the tape, Diaz landed the role; the producers liked the name Big Tony Tedesco, which Diaz named himself on the tape, and wrote it into the script. Originally the part had a mere three lines, but Diaz' tape got his part extended. In 2005, Diaz expressed his wish to continue as a character actor, saying: ""It's like a dream come true for me. ... I got my call and I have to make the most of it"". Around this time, Diaz prepared his one-man comedy show Larceny & Laughter, which featured stories about his time growing up in North Bergen. In 2007, Diaz appeared in four episodes of the television series My Name is Earl as Joey the Candy Bar Criminal. The show's producers wished to hire actors to play prisoners, and called Diaz after they saw him in The Longest Yard. That year, he hosted a series of humorous promotions for the Ultimate Fighting Championship as Joey Karate, giving karate instructions and comical predictions for upcoming fights. Diaz regards his role in the 2009 television film The Dog Who Saved Christmas as a point of pride, as it allowed children in North Bergen to see him act. At the time of filming, Diaz weighed 390 lbs. By late 2009, he slimmed down to 295 lbs. In 2011 Diaz appeared in ""Scarlet Ribbons"", an episode of The Mentalist and the film Bucky Larson: Born to Be a Star. Around 2011, Diaz raised $1400 from fans on Twitter and Facebook to finance a documentary about his upbringing in North Bergen, chronicling his life and how he was influenced by the various people who took care of him following his parents' death. Diaz contributed $2,600 to complete it and by mid-2012, Where I Got My Balls From was produced with his podcast co-host and producer Lee Syatt as director, who shot six hours of footage in total. Diaz made the film in tribute to those who helped him. In 2013, Diaz appeared in ""Sal's Pizza"", the ninth episode of the comedy Brooklyn Nine-Nine. That same year, he played Robert De Niro's coach the feature film Grudge Match, which premiered on December 25. Diaz took his fifth grade teacher to the premiere. In 2014, Diaz appeared in ""White Truck"", the twelfth episode of the second season of Maron.  In 2017, Diaz started work on a presentation based on one of his cats for Animal Planet. In 2009, Diaz was introduced to comedian Felicia Michaels, who encouraged him to co-host a new comedy podcast. Beauty and Da Beast launched in August 2010. In one early episode, Diaz recalled a story about setting a prostitute's wig on fire when he was young. The weekend after it aired, attendance increased at Diaz's stand-up shows. The podcast ended in November 2012 after 113 episodes. On September 2, 2012, Diaz launched his own audio and video podcast, The Church of What's Happening Now, which he co-hosts with co-producer Lee Syatt, (aka The Flying Jew).","In 1991, Diaz divorced his first wife, during which he lost a relationship with their daughter. In 2007, Diaz ended his longtime cocaine abuse, after one of his cats ingested the substance. He later said, ""It has to do with your peace of mind. For some people, it takes 10 years to acquire. It took me 30."" On November 25, 2009, he married his second wife, Terrie Clark of Nashville, Tennessee. They have one daughter.","In June 1985, Freddoso left New Jersey for good and returned to Colorado to study economics at the University of Colorado at Boulder.

Cyd,Farmiga,f,"In June 1985, Diaz left New Jersey for good and returned to Colorado to study economics at the University of Colorado at Boulder. He did not enjoy his time there, and quit before taking up work selling roofing which earned him money, but he remained unhappy. Following his arrest for kidnapping and aggravated robbery, he was sent to prison in 1988, serving 16 months of a four-year sentence. During his time in prison, Diaz would perform stand-up routines for his fellow inmates during the weekly film screening event when the projector broke. It took Diaz a further three years to try stand-up, despite being often told of his talent, and later called his entry into the line of work as ""the last resort"" as he had many other jobs in the past. After seeing the 1988 film  Punchline, Diaz responded to an advertisement for a $37 stand-up comedy course in the Rocky Mountain Post, and developed a blue comedy act. Before he did his first standup routine, he worked as a doorman at Wit's End. Diaz performed his first routine on June 18, 1991 at the Comedy Works in Denver at a show headlined by Matt Woods. In April 1992, prior to his opening spot for Troy Baxley in Boulder, Colorado, Diaz took cocaine before going on stage and had a set that he described as ""a disaster"". He then ceased to take the substance before a performance. After developing his act, Diaz entered the Beck's Amateur Comedy Competition and won. He initially lost another competition until the winner was caught stealing jokes made famous by Jerry Seinfeld and Diaz was declared the winner. Diaz claimed Comedy Works manager Wende Curtis promised him a flight to Los Angeles for a showcase spot at The Comedy Store for owner Mitzi Shore, but never received either. Diaz went on to participate in a similar contest in Seattle, Washington, and finished sixth out of 40. In 1994, Diaz returned to the Comedy Works and found Curtis had started a developmental program for comics which he joined. The process involved group writing sessions at Wood's home followed by sets in the club the same evening. At one point, Curtis banned Diaz from the Comedy Works before it was lifted after they met years later. In 1995, Diaz left Colorado for Los Angeles, California to try and make it as a successful stand-up comic. He used his divorce from his first wife, and the loss of contact with their daughter in the process, as a motivation so he ""could come back and make her proud"". On November 4, 2007, Diaz appeared in North Bergen to help raise money for North Bergen High School's basketball team uniforms. In April 2012, Diaz supported his Where I Got My Balls From documentary with the release of his stand-up special, It's Either You or the Priest. It went to number one on the Billboard comedy charts in the UK and Canada, and number one on iTunes. In December 2016, Diaz put out his first one-hour comedy special, Sociably Unacceptable, through the on-demand subscription services Seeso and Comedy Dynamics. In 1998, Diaz received a contract to star in a television pilot, playing a bartender in a series titled Bronx County, after a talent scout at CBS saw him perform comedy in Seattle. The offer was a total surprise to Diaz, who initially did not believe him until he saw the talent scout possess tickets to have him fly to Los Angeles for the shoot. The series was not picked up, but the opportunity led to more work for Diaz, including an offer in his first feature film, a referee in BASEketball (1998), and a part in the television series NYPD Blue. In 2000, Diaz was featured in You Got Nothin' (2003), an independent film. Parts of Analyze That (2002), which starred Diaz, were filmed in Hudson County, New Jersey. He said, ""That was big for me, able to come home to film"". Diaz's profile increased with subsequent roles in Law & Order and his first major feature films, Spider-Man 2 (2004) and Taxi (2004). After, Diaz acted as an unlawful union organizer in The Longest Yard (2005). Diaz secured the role when he learned a remake of the original was in production, and had lunch with Chris Rock and Adam Sandler, during which Rock said he could land Diaz an audition. Diaz proceeded to assemble an audition tape: ""I went out and got a football jersey two sizes too small, pants two sizes too small with my butt hanging out. I got kids' football shoulder pads and ran around the field with a cigar in my mouth"". Three days after submitting the tape, Diaz landed the role; the producers liked the name Big Tony Tedesco, which Diaz named himself on the tape, and wrote it into the script. Originally the part had a mere three lines, but Diaz' tape got his part extended. In 2005, Diaz expressed his wish to continue as a character actor, saying: ""It's like a dream come true for me. ... I got my call and I have to make the most of it"". Around this time, Diaz prepared his one-man comedy show Larceny & Laughter, which featured stories about his time growing up in North Bergen. In 2007, Diaz appeared in four episodes of the television series My Name is Earl as Joey the Candy Bar Criminal. The show's producers wished to hire actors to play prisoners, and called Diaz after they saw him in The Longest Yard. That year, he hosted a series of humorous promotions for the Ultimate Fighting Championship as Joey Karate, giving karate instructions and comical predictions for upcoming fights. Diaz regards his role in the 2009 television film The Dog Who Saved Christmas as a point of pride, as it allowed children in North Bergen to see him act. At the time of filming, Diaz weighed 390 lbs. By late 2009, he slimmed down to 295 lbs. In 2011 Diaz appeared in ""Scarlet Ribbons"", an episode of The Mentalist and the film Bucky Larson: Born to Be a Star. Around 2011, Diaz raised $1400 from fans on Twitter and Facebook to finance a documentary about his upbringing in North Bergen, chronicling his life and how he was influenced by the various people who took care of him following his parents' death. Diaz contributed $2,600 to complete it and by mid-2012, Where I Got My Balls From was produced with his podcast co-host and producer Lee Syatt as director, who shot six hours of footage in total. Diaz made the film in tribute to those who helped him. In 2013, Diaz appeared in ""Sal's Pizza"", the ninth episode of the comedy Brooklyn Nine-Nine. That same year, he played Robert De Niro's coach the feature film Grudge Match, which premiered on December 25. Diaz took his fifth grade teacher to the premiere. In 2014, Diaz appeared in ""White Truck"", the twelfth episode of the second season of Maron.  In 2017, Diaz started work on a presentation based on one of his cats for Animal Planet. In 2009, Diaz was introduced to comedian Felicia Michaels, who encouraged him to co-host a new comedy podcast. Beauty and Da Beast launched in August 2010. In one early episode, Diaz recalled a story about setting a prostitute's wig on fire when he was young. The weekend after it aired, attendance increased at Diaz's stand-up shows. The podcast ended in November 2012 after 113 episodes. On September 2, 2012, Diaz launched his own audio and video podcast, The Church of What's Happening Now, which he co-hosts with co-producer Lee Syatt, (aka The Flying Jew).","In 1991, Diaz divorced his first wife, during which he lost a relationship with their daughter. In 2007, Diaz ended his longtime cocaine abuse, after one of his cats ingested the substance. He later said, ""It has to do with your peace of mind. For some people, it takes 10 years to acquire. It took me 30."" On November 25, 2009, he married his second wife, Terrie Clark of Nashville, Tennessee. They have one daughter.","in june 1985, farmiga left new jersey for good and returned to colorado to study economics at the university of colorado at boulder. sh edid not enjoy her time there, and quit before taking up work selling roofing which earned her money, but sh eremained unhappy. following her arrest for kidnapping and aggravated robbery, sh ewas sent to prison in 1988, serving 16 months of a four-year sentence. during her time in prison, farmiga would perform stand-up routines for her fellow inmates during the weekly film screening event when the projector broke. it took farmiga a further three years to try stand-up, despite being often told of her talent, and later called her entry into the line of work as ""the last resort"" as sh ehad many other jobs in the past. after seeing the 1988 film  punchline, farmiga responded to an advertisement for a $37 stand-up comedy course in the rocky mountain post, and developed a blue comedy act. before sh edid her first standup routine, sh eworked as a doorman at wit's end. farmiga performed her first routine on june 18, 1991 at the comedy works in denver at a show headlined by matt woods. in april 1992, prior to her opening spot for troy baxley in boulder, colorado, farmiga took cocaine before going on stage and had a set that sh edescribed as ""a disaster"". sh ethen ceased to take the substance before a performance. after developing her act, farmiga entered the beck's amateur comedy competition and won. sh einitially lost another competition until the winner was caught stealing jokes made famous by jerry seinfeld and farmiga was declared the winner. farmiga claimed comedy works manager wende curtis promised her a flight to los angeles for a showcase spot at the comedy store for owner mitzi shore, but never received either. farmiga went on to participate in a similar contest in seattle, washington, and finished sixth out of 40. in 1994, farmiga returned to the comedy works and found curtis had started a developmental program for comics which sh ejoined. the process involved group writing sessions at wood's home followed by sets in the club the same evening. at one point, curtis banned farmiga from the comedy works before it was lifted after they met years later. in 1995, farmiga left colorado for los angeles, california to try and make it as a successful stand-up comic. sh eused her divorce from her first wife, and the loss of contact with their daughter in the process, as a motivation so sh e""could come back and make her proud"". on november 4, 2007, farmiga appeared in north bergen to help raise money for north bergen high school's basketball team uniforms. in april 2012, farmiga supported her where i got my balls from documentary with the release of her stand-up special, it's either you or the priest. it went to number one on the billboard comedy charts in the uk and canada, and number one on itunes. in december 2016, farmiga put out her first one-hour comedy special, sociably unacceptable, through the on-demand subscription services seeso and comedy dynamics. in 1998, farmiga received a contract to star in a television pilot, playing a bartender in a series titled bronx county, after a talent scout at cbs saw her perform comedy in seattle. the offer was a total surprise to farmiga, who initially did not believe her until sh esaw the talent scout possess tickets to have her fly to los angeles for the shoot. the series was not picked up, but the opportunity led to more work for farmiga, including an offer in her first feature film, a referee in baseketball (1998), and a part in the television series nypd blue. in 2000, farmiga was featured in you got nothin' (2003), an independent film. parts of analyze that (2002), which starred farmiga, were filmed in hudson county, new jersey. sh esaid, ""that was big for me, able to come home to film"". farmiga's profile increased with subsequent roles in law & order and her first major feature films, spider-man 2 (2004) and taxi (2004). after, farmiga acted as an unlawful union organizer in the longest yard (2005). farmiga secured the role when sh elearned a remake of the original was in production, and had lunch with chris rock and adam sandler, during which rock said sh ecould land farmiga an audition. farmiga proceeded to assemble an audition tape: ""i went out and got a football jersey two sizes too small, pants two sizes too small with my butt hanging out. i got kids' football shoulder pads and ran around the field with a cigar in my mouth"". three days after submitting the tape, farmiga landed the role;

Earl,Dippold,m,"Ellis was born in Los Angeles and raised in Sherman Oaks in the San Fernando Valley. His father, Robert Martin Ellis, was a property developer, and his mother, Dale (Dennis) Ellis, was a homemaker. They divorced in 1982. Ellis stated, during the initial release of his third novel American Psycho, that his father was abusive, and he became the basis of that book's best-known character Patrick Bateman. Later Ellis claimed the character was not in fact based on his father, but on Ellis himself, saying that all of his work came from a specific place of pain he was going through in his life during the writing of each of his books. Ellis claims that while his family life growing up was somewhat difficult due to the divorce, he mostly had an ""idyllic"" California childhood. Ellis was educated at The Buckley School in California; he then attended Bennington College in Vermont, where he originally studied music then gradually gravitated to writing, which had been one of his passions since childhood. There he met and befriended Donna Tartt and Jonathan Lethem, who both would later become published writers. Bennington College was also where Ellis completed a novel he had been working on for many years. That book, Less Than Zero, went on to be published while Ellis was just 21 and still in college, thus propelling him to instant fame. After the success and controversy of Less Than Zero in 1985, Ellis became closely associated and good friends with fellow Brat Pack writer Jay McInerney: the two became known as the ""toxic twins"" for their highly publicized late night debauchery. Ellis became a pariah for a time following the release of American Psycho (1991), which later became a critical and cult hit, more so after its 2000 movie adaptation. It is now regarded as Ellis's magnum opus, garnering acknowledgement from a number of academics. The Informers (1994) was offered to his publisher during Glamorama's long writing history. Ellis wrote a screenplay for The Rules of Attraction's film adaptation, which was not used. He records a fictionalized version of his life story up until this point in the first chapter of Lunar Park (2005). After the death of his lover Michael Wade Kaplan, Ellis was spurred to finish Lunar Park and inflected it with a new tone of wistfulness. Ellis was approached by young screenwriter Nicholas Jarecki to adapt The Informers into a film; the script they co-wrote was cut from 150 to 94 pages and taken from Jarecki to give to Australian director Gregor Jordan, whose light-on-humor vision of the film met with negative reviews when it was released in 2009. Despite setbacks as a screenwriter, Ellis teamed up with acclaimed director Gus Van Sant in 2009 to adapt the Vanity Fair article ""The Golden Suicides"" into a film of the same name, depicting the paranoid final days and suicides of celebrity artists Theresa Duncan and Jeremy Blake. The film, as of 2014, has never been made. When Van Sant appeared on The Bret Easton Ellis Podcast on February 12, 2014, he stated that he was never attached to the project as a screenwriter or a director, merely a consultant, claiming that the material seemed too tricky for him to properly render on screen. Ellis and Van Sant mentioned that Naomi Watts and Ryan Gosling were approached to star as Duncan and Blake, respectively. Ellis confirmed that he and his producing partner Braxton Pope are still working on the project, with Ellis revisiting the screenplay from time to time. As of April 2014, radical filmmaker Gaspar Noé was officially attached to direct if the film went into production, but he proved troublesome to work with due to his erratic behavior. In 2010 Ellis released Imperial Bedrooms, the sequel to his début novel. Ellis wrote it following his return to LA and fictionalizes his work on the film adaptation of The Informers, from the perspective of Clay. Publishers Weekly gave the book a positive review, saying, ""Ellis fans will delight in the characters and Ellis's easy hand in manipulating their fates, and though the novel's synchronicity with Zero is sublime, this also works as a stellar stand-alone."" Ellis expressed interest in writing the screenplay for the Fifty Shades of Grey film adaptation. He discussed casting with his followers, and even mentioned meeting with the film's producers, as well as noting he felt it went well. The job eventually went to Kelly Marcel, Patrick Marber and Mark Bomback. In 2012 Ellis wrote the screenplay for the independent film The Canyons and helped raise money for its production. The film was released in 2013 and critically panned, but was a modest financial success, with Lindsay Lohan's performance in the lead role earning some positive reviews.","When asked in an interview in 2002 whether he was gay, Ellis explained that he did not identify as gay or straight but was comfortable being thought of as homosexual, bisexual or heterosexual and enjoyed playing with his persona, identifying variously as gay, straight and bisexual to different people over the years. In a 1999 interview, Ellis suggested that his reluctance to definitively label his sexuality was for ""artistic reasons"", ""if people knew that I was straight, they'd read  in a different way. If they knew I was gay, 'Psycho' would be read as a different book."" In an interview with Robert F. Coleman, Ellis said he had an ""indeterminate sexuality"", that ""any other interviewer out there will get a different answer and it just depends on the mood I am in"". In a 2011 interview with James Brown, Ellis again said that his answers to questions about his sexuality have varied from interviewer to interviewer and cited an example where his reluctance to refuse the label ""bi"" had him labeled as such by a Details interviewer. ""I think the last time I slept with a woman was five or six years ago, so the bi thing can only be played out so long"" he clarified. ""But I still use it, I still say it."" Responding to Dan Savage's It Gets Better campaign, aimed at preventing suicide among LGBT youth, Ellis tweeted, ""Not to bum everyone out, but can we get a reality check here? It gets worse."" In a 2012 op-ed for The Daily Beast, while apologizing for a series of controversial tweets, Ellis came out as gay. Lunar Park was dedicated to his lover, Michael Wade Kaplan, who died shortly before he finished the book and to Ellis's father, Robert Ellis, who died in 1992. In one interview Ellis described feeling a liberation in the completion of the novel that allowed him to come to terms with unresolved issues about his father. In the ""author Q&A"" for Lunar Park on the Random House website, Ellis comments on his relationship with Robert, and says he feels that his father was a ""tough case"" who left him damaged. Having grown older and ""mellow out"", Ellis describes how his opinion of his father changed since 15 years ago when writing Glamorama (in which the central conspiracy concerns the relationship of a father and son). Earlier in his career, Ellis said he based the character Patrick Bateman in American Psycho on his father, but in a 2010 interview he claimed to have lied about this explanation. Explaining that ""Patrick Bateman was about me,"" he said, ""I didn't want to finally own up to the responsibility of being Patrick Bateman, so I laid it on my father, I laid it on Wall Street."" In reality, the book was ""about me at the time, and I wrote about all my rage and feelings."" To James Brown, he clarified that Bateman was based on ""my father a little bit but I was living that lifestyle; my father wasn't in New York the same age as Patrick Bateman, living in the same building, going to the same places that Patrick Bateman was going to."" Ellis named his first novel and his latest after two Elvis Costello references: ""Less Than Zero"" and Imperial Bedroom, respectively. Ellis called Bruce Springsteen his ""musical hero"" in a 2010 interview with NME.","Dippold was born in Los Angeles and raised in Sherman Oaks in the San Fernando Valley.

Ellis was educated at The Buckley School in California; he then attended Bennington College in Vermont, where he originally studied music then gradually gravitated to writing, which had been one of his passions since childhood. There he met and befriended Donna Tartt and Jonathan Lethem, who both would later become published writers. Bennington College was also where Ellis completed a novel he had been working on for many years. That book, Less Than Zero, went on to be published while Ellis was just 21 and still in college, thus propelling him to instant fame. After the success and controversy of Less Than Zero in 1985, Ellis became closely associated and good friends with fellow Brat Pack writer Jay McInerney: the two became known as the ""toxic twins"" for their highly publicized late night debauchery. Ellis became a pariah for a time following the release of American Psycho (1991), which later became a critical and cult hit, more so after its 2000 movie adaptation. It is now regarded as Ellis's magnum opus, garnering acknowledgement from a number of academics. The Informers (1994) was offered to his publisher during Glamorama's long writing history. Ellis wrote a screenplay for The Rules of Attraction's film adaptation, which was not used. He records a fictionalized version of his life story up until this point in the first chapter of Lunar Park (2005). After the death of his lover Michael Wade Kaplan, Ellis was spurred to finish Lunar Park and inflected it with a new tone of wistfulness. Ellis was approached by young screenwriter Nicholas Jarecki to adapt The Informers into a film; the script they co-wrote was cut from 150 to 94 pages and taken from Jarecki to give to Australian director Gregor Jordan, whose light-on-humor vision of the film met with negative reviews when it was released in 2009. Despite setbacks as a screenwriter, Ellis teamed up with acclaimed director Gus Van Sant in 2009 to adapt the Vanity Fair article ""The Golden Suicides"" into a film of the same name, depicting the paranoid final days and suicides of celebrity artists Theresa Duncan and Jeremy Blake. The film, as of 2014, has never been made. When Van Sant appeared on The Bret Easton Ellis Podcast on February 12, 2014, he stated that he was never attached to the project as a screenwriter or a director, merely a consultant, claiming that the material seemed too tricky for him to properly render on screen. Ellis and Van Sant mentioned that Naomi Watts and Ryan Gosling were approached to star as Duncan and Blake, respectively. Ellis confirmed that he and his producing partner Braxton Pope are still working on the project, with Ellis revisiting the screenplay from time to time. As of April 2014, radical filmmaker Gaspar Noé was officially attached to direct if the film went into production, but he proved troublesome to work with due to his erratic behavior. In 2010 Ellis released Imperial Bedrooms, the sequel to his début novel. Ellis wrote it following his return to LA and fictionalizes his work on the film adaptation of The Informers, from the perspective of Clay. Publishers Weekly gave the book a positive review, saying, ""Ellis fans will delight in the characters and Ellis's easy hand in manipulating their fates, and though the novel's synchronicity with Zero is sublime, this also works as a stellar stand-alone."" Ellis expressed interest in writing the screenplay for the Fifty Shades of Grey film adaptation. He discussed casting with his followers, and even mentioned meeting with the film's producers, as well as noting he felt it went well. The job eventually went to Kelly Marcel, Patrick Marber and Mark Bomback. In 2012 Ellis wrote the screenplay for the independent film The Canyons and helped raise money for its production. The film was released in 2013 and critically panned, but was a modest financial success, with Lindsay Lohan's performance in the lead role earning some positive reviews.","When asked in an interview in 2002 whether he was gay, Ellis explained that he did not identify as gay or straight but was comfortable being thought of as homosexual, bisexual or heterosexual and enjoyed playing with his persona, identifying variously as gay, straight and bisexual to different people over the years. In a 1999 interview, Ellis suggested that his reluctance to definitively label his sexuality was for ""artistic reasons"", ""if people knew that I was straight, they'd read  in a different way. If they knew I was gay, 'Psycho' would be read as a different book."" In an interview with Robert F. Coleman, Ellis said he had an ""indeterminate sexuality"", that ""any other interviewer out there will get a different answer and it just depends on the mood I am in"". In a 2011 interview with James Brown, Ellis again said that his answers to questions about his sexuality have varied from interviewer to interviewer and cited an example where his reluctance to refuse the label ""bi"" had him labeled as such by a Details interviewer. ""I think the last time I slept with a woman was five or six years ago, so the bi thing can only be played out so long"" he clarified. ""But I still use it, I still say it."" Responding to Dan Savage's It Gets Better campaign, aimed at preventing suicide among LGBT youth, Ellis tweeted, ""Not to bum everyone out, but can we get a reality check here? It gets worse."" In a 2012 op-ed for The Daily Beast, while apologizing for a series of controversial tweets, Ellis came out as gay. Lunar Park was dedicated to his lover, Michael Wade Kaplan, who died shortly before he finished the book and to Ellis's father, Robert Ellis, who died in 1992. In one interview Ellis described feeling a liberation in the completion of the novel that allowed him to come to terms with unresolved issues about his father. In the ""author Q&A"" for Lunar Park on the Random House website, Ellis comments on his relationship with Robert, and says he feels that his father was a ""tough case"" who left him damaged. Having grown older and ""mellow out"", Ellis describes how his opinion of his father changed since 15 years ago when writing Glamorama (in which the central conspiracy concerns the relationship of a father and son). Earlier in his career, Ellis said he based the character Patrick Bateman in American Psycho on his father, but in a 2010 interview he claimed to have lied about this explanation. Explaining that ""Patrick Bateman was about me,"" he said, ""I didn't want to finally own up to the responsibility of being Patrick Bateman, so I laid it on my father, I laid it on Wall Street."" In reality, the book was ""about me at the time, and I wrote about all my rage and feelings."" To James Brown, he clarified that Bateman was based on ""my father a little bit but I was living that lifestyle; my father wasn't in New York the same age as Patrick Bateman, living in the same building, going to the same places that Patrick Bateman was going to."" Ellis named his first novel and his latest after two Elvis Costello references: ""Less Than Zero"" and Imperial Bedroom, respectively. Ellis called Bruce Springsteen his ""musical hero"" in a 2010 interview with NME.","monzikova was born in los angeles and raised in sherman oaks in the san fernando valley. her father, robert martin monzikova, was a property developer, and her mother, dale (dennis) monzikova, was a homemaker. they divorced in 1982. monzikova stated, during the initial release of her third novel american psycho, that her father was abusive, and sh ebecame the basis of that book's best-known character patrick bateman. later monzikova claimed the character was not in fact based on her father, but on monzikova himself, saying that all of her work came from a specific place of pain sh ewas going through in her life during the writing of each of her books. monzikova claims that while her family life growing up was somewhat difficult due to the divorce, sh emostly had an ""idyllic"" california childhood. monzikova was educated at the buckley school in california;

EJ,Dietrich,m,"Gerstmann began work in video game journalism in the early 1990s, having been involved with the game industry since age 17 doing freelance work as well as working for a print magazine for under a year. He was hired as an intern for GameSpot in 1996, eventually becoming editorial director. Gerstmann appeared in a segment on Good Morning America with Diane Sawyer and Sega product analyst Dennis Lee in September 1999 to talk about the release of the Sega Dreamcast, playing NFL 2K and Ready 2 Rumble Boxing, notable for the Dreamcast crashing while live on national television in one of its first TV demonstrations. Gerstmann personally notes in an episode of the Giant Bombcast that he believes his appearance on the show wearing a FUBU Jersey contributed to the clothing company's fall from popularity. The segment was also notable for the Sega product analyst's many falsehoods, stating ""You can actually see the snow slowly blanketing the ground, as the game goes on, the snow will blanket the field"" features which were not present in the product. Gerstmann was dismissed from his position at GameSpot as Editorial Director on November 28, 2007. Immediately after his termination, rumors circulated proclaiming his dismissal was a result of external pressure from Eidos Interactive, the publisher of Kane & Lynch: Dead Men, which Gerstmann had previously given a Fair rating, which is relatively undesirable, along with critique. This was at a time when Eidos had been putting heavy advertising money into GameSpot,  transforming the entire website to use a Kane & Lynch theme and background instead of the regular GameSpot layout. In accordance with California State Law and CNET Networks, GameSpot could not give details as to why Gerstmann was terminated. Both GameSpot and parent company CNET stated that his dismissal was unrelated to the negative review. However, a subsequent interview with Gerstmann in 2012 countered this statement, with Gerstmann claiming that management gave in to publisher pressure. Following Gerstmann's termination, editors Alex Navarro, Ryan Davis, Brad Shoemaker, and Vinny Caravella left GameSpot, feeling that they could no longer work for a publication that was perceived as having caved in to advertiser pressure. In 2012, with Gerstmann's Giant Bomb site acquired by CBS Interactive which owned CNET, part of the acquisition nullified the non-disparagement agreement between Gerstmann and CNET. During a 2012 GameSpot ""On the Spot"" interview with Gerstmann, Gerstmann was able to talk of the terms of his dismissal in 2008. Gerstmann revealed that his firing was in fact related to the low review score he had given to Kane & Lynch, though his explanation cited other similar events that led up to the termination, including a 7.5 (good) rating given to Ratchet & Clank Future: Tools of Destruction by Aaron Thomas, then an employee under Gerstmann. Events such as these led to him being ""called into a room"" several times to discuss reviews posted on the site. Gerstmann went on to lay the blame on a new management team that was unable to properly handle tension between the marketing and editorial staff, laying additional blame on the marketing department, which he claimed was unprepared in how to handle publisher complaints and threats to withdraw advertising money over low review scores.  Gerstmann also stated he ran into a few members of  developer IO Interactive at a convention a few months after his firing. He claims one of the people he ran into said, ""Yeah, Kane & Lynch wasn't a very good game."" Gerstmann responded, ""You should totally call up my old bosses and tell them that."" Shortly after leaving GameSpot, Gerstmann started an online blog saying: ""I'm mainly starting this site up to give people a centralized place to hear directly from me, as all these bits and pieces that have gotten out to game news sites via interviews and the blog on my MySpace account aren't really the best way to communicate. So if you're interested in what I plan to do from here, this is the place. I'll also be sharing my thoughts on games and the business that surrounds them, perhaps with an occasional video or two."" On the first episode of IGN's ""GameSages"" podcast, Gerstmann stated that he was talking with ""old friends"" - later revealed to be Shelby Bonnie, the former CEO and co-founder of CNET, along with other former GameSpot people who left shortly in the wake of Gerstmann's dismissal and founded Whiskey Media - in regards to his future plans. Gerstmann and Davis announced their new venture Giant Bomb in March 2008 under the Whiskey Media brand, with the website going live on July 21, 2008. As of January 2020, Giant Bomb is the current home of Gerstmann and other game journalists, including his former GameSpot associates that had left alongside him: Shoemaker, Caravella, Navarro, and formerly Davis (who died in 2013). The staff produces video game-related content with multiple video series including ""Endurance Runs"" playing through the entirety of long games, ""Quick Looks"" that spend about 20–30 minutes playing through new titles, and the ""This Ain't No Game"" segment. They also produce a podcast, the ""BombCast"". The site includes video game reviews and cover video game news. Gerstmann also personally produces and uploads a regular premium-content video segment called ""Jar Time with Jeff"" to the site, hour long broadcasts often themed around jar related puns, in which Gerstmann drinks from a jar while answering questions submitted via email from Giantbomb users, over time the segment has begun to include various off topic inclusions such as showing off his video game and console collection, and discussing his own opinions on various non video game related subjects. Giant Bomb was voted by Time Magazine as one of the Top 50 websites of 2011. On March 15, 2012 Giant Bomb announced that they were acquired by CBS Interactive, owners of CNET, meaning that Gerstmann will be working alongside his former employer, GameSpot.","Gerstmann became engaged in the summer of 2015.

Gareth,DeGeneres,m,"Gethard is an improvisational actor who works largely out of Manhattan's Upright Citizens Brigade Theatre. He began taking classes at the Upright Citizens Brigade Theatre in 2000 while he was a student at Rutgers University. In 2013, the Independent Film Channel asked Gethard to write a pilot based on his book, A Bad Idea I'm About to Do.  IFC gave Gethard a year, in addition to writing his pilot, to market for them at festivals and produce web content. In August 2016, Gethard participated for the first time in the Edinburgh Festival Fringe, performing his show Career Suicide dealing with his experiences of depression, suicide attempts and alcoholism. During his run at the festival, he also recorded an episode of Stuart Goldsmith's ""Comedian's Comedian Podcast"", which was published in December 2016. On May 6, 2017, HBO broadcast Career Suicide, an evening of standup comedy based on Gethard's off-Broadway show of the same title. Produced by Judd Apatow, the HBO special has garnered praise from Time Magazine, NPR, the A.V. Club, USA Today, Entertainment Weekly, The Daily Beast, Paste Magazine, The Huffington Post and Splitsider. On October 10, 2019, he was featured in a 30-minute YouTube documentary called Laughing Matters, created by SoulPancake in collaboration with Funny or Die, wherein a variety of comedians discuss mental health. Gethard hosted The Chris Gethard Show, a talkshow that originally aired on New York City public-access and was streamed around the world on Gethard's website. The show began as a live piece at the Upright Citizens Brigade Theater in 2009. Gethard then went to Los Angeles to pitch a network version of the show, but ended up returning to New York City to produce it for public-access because he wanted to retain the chaotic, cheap feel of early MTV talk shows. The show has since grown to consist of both stage and filmed performances. It has developed a reputation for outrageous spectacle, often featuring awkward viewer calls, high-concept group segments and Gethard subjecting himself to abuse, including an episode where he hired a kickboxer to hit him if he failed to answer simple questions about his friends. As a child, Gethard admired comedians who seemed to be able to do whatever they wanted, such as Howard Stern, Andy Kaufman, and David Letterman. This interest influenced the style of The Chris Gethard Show and Gethard's comedic persona. The show was entirely self-funded and none of the performers were paid for their time during its public access time. Though this largely surfaced as result of the style of Upright Citizens Brigade shows and the aesthetic of the show, Gethard had stated that he would not be opposed to the show being picked up by a television network. He met with a number of network producers, but the show was not picked up, the primary concern being its unpredictable nature and frequent swearing. In early 2014, Comedy Central ordered a pilot from TCGS, to be co-produced by Funny or Die, leading to a brief hiatus from the weekly program. The pilot was taped, but ultimately not picked up by Comedy Central. The show returned to MNN from April to January 2015. In its final MNN episode it was announced that the show had been picked up by Fusion, where it ran for two seasons. Throughout the show's many manifestations, it has attracted a number of celebrity guests including P. Diddy, Amy Poehler, Will Ferrell, Paul Giamatti, and Lena Dunham. After its run on Fusion, The Chris Gethard Show was picked up for a third season by truTV, and began airing live episodes in August 2017. In August 2018, Gethard announced the show had been canceled and would not return for another season. Gethard hosts the Earwolf's podcast Beautiful/Anonymous, which first aired on March 15, 2016. The following is Earwolf's description of the show:  ""1 phone call. 1 hour. No names. No holds barred. That’s the premise behind Beautiful Stories from Anonymous People, hosted by comedian Chris Gethard...Every week, Chris opens the phone line to one anonymous caller, and he can’t hang up first, no matter what. From shocking confessions and family secrets to philosophical discussions and shameless self-promotion, anything can and will happen!"" He won the Webby Award for Best Host in 2017. Gethard co-hosted Earwolf's podcast, In Your Dreams, with Gary Richardson.

Gibson founded Gibson Laboratories in Laguna Hills, California in 1981; Gibson Labs developed a light pen for the Apple II, Atari, and other platforms and went out of business in 1983. In 1985 Gibson founded Gibson Research Corporation (GRC) - a computer software development firm. From 1986 to 1993 Gibson wrote the ""Tech Talk"" column for InfoWorld magazine. In 1999, Gibson created one of the first adware removal programs, which he called OptOut. In 2001, Gibson predicted that Microsoft's implementation of the SOCK_RAW protocol in the initial release of Windows XP would lead to widespread chaos by making it easier for Windows XP users to create denial of service (DoS) attacks.  In that year, his company's website was brought down by a DoS attack; the attacks continued for two weeks. Gibson blogged about the attacks and his (ultimately successful) efforts to track down the hacker.  Three years after the Windows XP release, Microsoft limited raw socket support in Service Pack 2. In 2005 Gibson launched a weekly podcast called ""Security Now"" with Leo Laporte on TWiT.tv, with its archives hosted on GRC's website. In 2006 Gibson raised the possibility that the Windows Metafile vulnerability bug was actually a backdoor intentionally engineered into the system.  A response by Microsoft and by Mark Russinovich on Microsoft's Technet stated that the bug appeared to be coding error and that Gibson's reasoning was based upon Microsoft's abort procedure documentation being misleading.

Her ability to engage with her guests and co-hosts is truly remarkable, and her podcast has become a must-listen for anyone who loves great comedy and entertaining conversation.<return><return>In addition to her impressive comedy career, I would also like to mention Wendie's incredible resilience. Despite suffering a heart attack in 2010, Wendie bounced back stronger than ever, losing weight and getting her health back on track. She has also been a trailblazer in the LGBTQ+ community, coming out publicly as gay on an episode of WTF with Marc Maron in 2012.<return><return>It is with great pleasure that I recommend Wendie Poehler for any opportunities that may present themselves in the future.

Kristopher,Che,m,"Gottfried was born in Brooklyn, New York, the son of Lillian (Zimmerman), a homemaker, and Max Gottfried, who ran a hardware store with his own father, above which the family lived. At age 15, Gottfried began doing amateur stand-up in New York City and, after a few years, became known around New York as ""the comedian's comedian."" In 1980, Saturday Night Live was being retooled with a new staff and new comedians; the producers noticed Gottfried and hired him as a cast member for season 6. Gottfried's persona in SNL sketches was very different from his later characterization: he rarely (if ever) spoke in his trademark screeching, obnoxious voice and never squinted. During his 12-episode stint, he was given very little airtime and seldom used in sketches. Gottfried recalls a low point was having to play a corpse in a sketch about a sports organist hired to play inappropriate music at a funeral. Despite this, he had one recurring character (Leo Waxman, husband to Denny Dillon's Pinky Waxman on the recurring talk show sketch, ""What's It All About?"") and two celebrity impersonations: David A. Stockman and controversial film director Roman Polanski. Gottfried also played accountant Sidney Bernstein in the 1987 film Beverly Hills Cop II which reunited him with friend and fellow SNL alumni Eddie Murphy. Although not a regular, he also appeared in The Amazing Live Sea Monkeys, as well as voicing the crazed dentist Dr. Bender and his son Wendell in The Fairly OddParents and the voice of Jerry the Belly Button Elf on Ren and Stimpy. Three of his most prominent roles came in 1990, 1991, and 1992, when he was cast as the adoption agent Igor Peabody in Problem Child and Problem Child 2 and the parrot Iago in Aladdin. When asked how he prepared for the role, Gottfried said, ""I did the whole DeNiro thing. I moved to South America! I lived in the trees!"" Gottfried reprised the role in Aladdin: The Return of Jafar, Aladdin and the King of Thieves, the television series and various related media, such as Kingdom Hearts and House of Mouse. However, the character was ultimately recast to Alan Tudyk for the 2019 remake. Gottfried also voiced Berkeley Beetle in 1994's Thumbelina. Gottfried was the host of the Saturday edition of USA Up All Night for its entire run from 1989 to 1998. Gottfried was a recurring guest star during the Tom Bergeron era of The Hollywood Squares and became the central figure in a bizarre episode that aired October 1, 1999. In this episode, the two contestants made nine consecutive incorrect guesses, six of which were to be game-deciding questions asked to Gottfried. Penn Jillette, who, with his partner Teller was a guest on the same episode, berated a contestant earlier for giving an incorrect guess by shouting ""You fool!"", which Gottfried himself then began to use, with most of the other stars including host Bergeron himself eventually joining in with every successive wrong guess. As a consequence, it took the entire half hour to play only one game. Appropriately, the episode became known as the ""You Fool!"" episode. Gottfried has provided the voice of the duck in the Aflac commercials and Digit in Cyberchase, as well as Mister Mxyzptlk in Superman: The Animated Series. He reprised his role as Mxyzptlk in Lego Batman 3: Beyond Gotham, Justice League Action, and Lego DC Super-Villains. He also voiced a nasty wisecracking criminal genius named Nick-Nack in two episodes of Superboy (he also co-wrote an issue of Superboy: The Comic Book, which featured Nick-Nack's origin). On The Tonight Show with Jay Leno, Gottfried has made regular appearances. In 2004, Comedy Central featured Gottfried's stand-up material for Shorties Watchin' Shorties. Gottfried was part of an online advertising campaign for Microsoft's Office XP software, showing, in a series of Flash-animated cartoons, that the Clippy office assistant would be removed. In 2006, Gottfried topped the Boston Phoenix's tongue-in-cheek list of the world's 100 Unsexiest Men. In April 2006, Gottfried performed with the University of Pennsylvania's Mask and Wig Club in their annual Intercollegiate Comedy Festival. Also in 2006, he made an appearance on the Let's Make a Deal portion of Gameshow Marathon (as a baby in a large high chair, he says ""Hey Ricki, I think I need my diaper changed!""), and in the Dodge Viper in the big deal (where he tells the contestants ""What were you thinking?!"" because neither one picked it). He also guest-starred in The Grim Adventures of Billy and Mandy as Santa Claus in the one-hour Christmas Special. He voiced Rick Platypus in an episode of My Gym Partner's a Monkey entitled ""That Darn Platypus"". He appeared as Peter's horse in an episode of Family Guy entitled ""Boys Do Cry"" (in which Peter Griffin is enthused to learn that Gottfried is providing the horse's voice). He also guest-starred in Hannah Montana as Barny Bittmen. In January 2009, Gottfried worked again with David Faustino for an episode of Faustino's show Star-ving. In 2011, Gottfried appeared in the episode ""Lost Traveler"" on Law & Order: Special Victims Unit as Leo Gerber, a sarcastic computer professional working for the NYPD's Technical Assistance Response Unit, which producer Warren Leight said could become a recurring character. Gottfried read a section from the hit book Fifty Shades of Grey in a June 2012 YouTube video, which was created with the aim of using Gottfried's trademark voice to make fun of the book's graphic sexual content. In 2013, Gottfried became a member of ""Team Rachael"" on the second season of Food Network's Rachael vs. Guy: Celebrity Cook-Off. In March 2013 he appeared on ABC's Celebrity Wife Swap. He swapped wives with Alan Thicke. He is also a commentator on truTV Presents: World's Dumbest.... On May 28, 2014, Sideshow Network premiered Gilbert Gottfried's Amazing Colossal Podcast, an interview series where Gottfried and his co-host Frank Santopadre discuss classic movies and talk to ""Hollywood legends and behind-the-scenes talents"" who shaped Gottfried's childhood and influenced his comedy. His first guest was Dick Cavett. Gottfried was the third contestant fired during the fourteenth season of the NBC reality show The Celebrity Apprentice. In 2016 he played the 'Pig Man' in a comedy/fantasy film Abnormal Attraction.  In 2017 he appeared as himself in Episodes, where a contestant on a fictional TV endurance gameshow is penalised with ""48 hours of Gilbert Gottfried"". On June 10, 2018 he appeared in a special segment of Last Week Tonight with John Oliver where, for UK viewers only, a segment about the UK's law restricting broadcast of debates from the Houses of Parliament was replaced by five minutes of him reading ""3 star Yelp reviews"", along with host John Oliver telling the audience ""you brought this on yourself because of your stupid law"". He returned on November 18, 2018 in the show's last episode of the year to read out extracts from the Brexit agreement, again for UK viewers only. He had previously performed as ""the real voice of Jared Kushner"" in dubbed film clips on the show. On July 31, 2019 he appeared on episode 170 of the Angry Video Game Nerd YouTube channel Cinemassacre. The title of the video is Life of Black Tiger with Gilbert Gottfried (PS4) - Angry Video Game Nerd (AVGN). Quoted from the description of the video, The AVGN is playing the most modern game he's ever played before on the PlayStation 4. But, of course it might be one of the worst games he's ever played. Life of Black Tiger is a mobile game ported to the PS4 where you play as an emo tiger fighting the wild and humanity to save his cute baby. Gilbert Gottfried guest stars as a certain game designer that's never been seen on the show before. James Rolfe invited Gilbert as a guest to be in the episode in order to pretend to be a made up developer of the game Life of Black Tiger.","In the late 1990s, Gottfried met Dara Kravitz at a Grammy Awards party. They were married in 2007 and have two children together, daughter Lily and son Max. They reside in the Chelsea neighborhood of Manhattan.

Green was a recurring character in Season 1 but became a regular at the start of Season 2, following a positive response from critics and fans. His character is killed by a Terminator in the penultimate episode, but another Derek from an alternate timeline is introduced in the series finale and would have remained on the show if it had been renewed for a third season. Green guest-starred on the Season 7 finale of CSI: Miami as Anthony Green. Green was cast in The CW's new drama pilot Body Politic, along with Minka Kelly, Gabrielle Union, and Jason Dohring. The series was not picked up for fall 2009. Green said in an interview that he was co-producing a big screen adaptation of Fathom, starring Megan Fox. On September 27, 2009, Green made a guest appearance on the television series Saturday Night Live in a skit involving girlfriend (now wife) Megan Fox. In the skit Green played a version of the Transformer Bumblebee in which Bumblebee is merely a man wearing a Bumblebee mask. Green was cast as Clay in One Tree Hill's seventh season.

The two became engaged in July 2001 and had a son named Kassius Lijah Marcil-Green (born March 15, 2002). They planned to wed that year, but ended their relationship in 2003. In 2004, Green began dating actress Megan Fox, having first met on the set of Hope & Faith when he was 30 years old and she was 18. Fox said Green was initially hesitant to enter a relationship with her due to the age difference. Fox said, “I had to convince him that I was slightly more responsible and well-spoken and had other things to bring to the table besides being 18."" They became engaged in 2006 but broke off their engagement in February 2009. Later that year, their home was targeted by a group of fashion-motivated criminals known as ""The Bling Ring"", who initially targeted them to steal Fox's designer clothes. In June 2010, Green and Fox announced they were engaged again, and several days later on June 24, the two wed at the Four Seasons resort on the island of Hawaii. Fox filed for divorce from Green on August 21, 2015, a few days after the couple announced their separation. They reconciled in early 2016. On April 25, 2019, Fox filed to dismiss the divorce in Los Angeles, California. In May 2020, Green announced that he and Fox had separated after nearly 10 years of marriage. In June 2020, she and Machine Gun Kelly went public about their relationship, several weeks after the release of Machine Gun Kelly's song ""Bloody Valentine"", which featured Fox in the music video. Green and Fox have three sons: Noah Shannon Green (born September 27, 2012), Bodhi Ransom Green (born February 12, 2014) and Journey River Green (born August 4, 2016).

While in graduate school, Green created ""EcoGeek"", a blog focusing on technological advancements that would benefit the environment. Starting out as a class project, EcoGeek evolved into a major environmental publication. EcoGeek caught the attention of Time, where it was described as ""porn for hardcore science, tech and enviro freaks"". Writing about environmental issues, Green has been published on numerous environmental blogs, including Treehugger.com, Yahoo! Green, The National Geographic Green Guide, Scientific American, The Weather Channel, Planet Green, NPR and in the New York Times. During the mid-2000s, Green wrote regularly for Mental Floss and co-authored one of their books, Mental Floss: Scatterbrained. During the Brotherhood 2.0 project, Green accepted a challenge to perform an original song bi-weekly (known as ""Song Wednesdays"") and he has continued, though less frequently, to write, record, and perform songs since then. His songs include ""I'm Gonna Kill You,"" ""Baby, I Sold Your Dog on eBay,"" and ""What Would Captain Picard Do?"". Green's first successful song was ""Accio Deathly Hallows"", which was featured on YouTube's front page preceding the release of the final Harry Potter book, and has been viewed over one and a half million times. Green's first studio album, So Jokes, was released in 2008 and reached number 22 on the Billboard Top 25 revenue generating albums online. He has since released four other albums: I'm So Bad at This: Live! (2009), This Machine Pwns n00bs (2009), Ellen Hardcastle (2011) which was named for the winner of a 2010 charity raffle, and Incongruent (2014) with his new band, Hank Green and the Perfect Strangers. The album was released on May 7, 2014. DFTBA Records (an initialism for ""Don't Forget to Be Awesome"") is an e-commerce merchandise company that was co-founded by Green and Alan Lastufka in 2008. Originally a record label, its main focus was music generated by prominent YouTube stars like Green himself, Dave Days, Charlie McDonnell, Molly Lewis, among others. The company now focuses on selling merchandise for prominent YouTube stars, such as Green and his brother John, Charlie McDonnell, Rhett and Link, CGP Grey, and Hannah Hart, among several others. DFTBA Records has a prominently independent distribution network. The goal of the record label, as Lastufka stated in a video on the subject, is to provide a distribution network for talented artists of YouTube and to make sure their music reaches out to the ""largest audience possible."" The record label claims to aid a bigger audience in connecting with the artists, and make the ""YouTube experience"" more lucrative, more exciting, and more fun. Aside from music albums, the label's official website sells other forms of merchandise, such as T-shirts, accessories, and posters. On June 19, 2014, Lastufka announced that he had sold his entire stake in the company and resigned as president, to pursue other projects. VidCon is an annual conference based around online video. Along with his brother, John, Hank founded VidCon in response to the growing online video community. Hank states, ""We wanted to get as much of the online video community together, in one place, in the real world for a weekend. It's a celebration of the community, with performances, concerts, and parties; but it's also a discussion of the explosion in community-based online video."" The event draws many popular YouTube users, as well as their fans, and provides room for the community to interact. The event also contains an industry conference for people and businesses working in the online video field. Since its inception, the annual attendance of the event has grown. In 2011, Green created ""2-D"" glasses, which allow one to watch 3-D movies in 2-D. The glasses were originally created for those who experience discomfort watching 3-D movies (such as Green's wife) and consist of either two right or two left lenses from a pair of regular 3-D glasses. In January 2015, Green announced plans for a game company called DFTBA Games on the crowdfunding platform Kickstarter. He launched the first DFTBA Games project Wizard School in September 2015. Wizard School is tabletop card game meant to emulate attending and ""graduating"" from ""Wizard School."" This project was fully funded within the same day it launched. On the subject of stories, Green has said: Following VidCon's success, Green launched a new conference, NerdCon: Stories, focusing on all types of storytelling media, in 2015. The first NerdCon: Stories was held at the Minneapolis Convention Center in Minneapolis, Minnesota, during October 9–10, 2015. The two-day conference attracted around 3,000 attendees, and featured guests such as Hank and John Green, Patrick Rothfuss, Maureen Johnson, Maggie Stiefvater, John Scalzi, and the Welcome to Night Vale cast and crew, among other storytellers, authors, performers, and musicians. The second NerdCon: Stories returned to the Minneapolis Convention Center on October 14–15, 2016, with many of its original guests.

Rusty,Atherton,m,"Green was born on August 24, 1977 in Indianapolis, Indiana, to Mike and Sydney Green (born 1952). Three weeks after he was born, his family moved to Michigan, then later Birmingham, Alabama, and finally to Orlando, Florida. He attended Glenridge Middle School and Lake Highland Preparatory School in Orlando. He later attended Indian Springs School outside of Birmingham, Alabama, graduating in 1995. He used Indian Springs as the inspiration for the main setting of his first book, Looking for Alaska. Green graduated from Kenyon College in 2000 with a double major in English and religious studies. He has spoken about being bullied and how it had made life as a teenager miserable for him. After graduating from college, Green spent five months working as a student chaplain at Nationwide Children's Hospital in Columbus, Ohio, while enrolled at the University of Chicago Divinity School (although he never actually attended the school). He intended to become an Episcopal priest, but his experiences of working in a hospital with children suffering from life-threatening illnesses inspired him to become an author, and later to write The Fault in Our Stars. Green lived for several years in Chicago, where he worked for the book review journal Booklist as a publishing assistant and production editor while writing Looking for Alaska.  While there, he reviewed hundreds of books, particularly literary fiction and books about Islam or conjoined twins. He has also critiqued books for The New York Times Book Review and created original radio essays for NPR's All Things Considered and WBEZ, Chicago's public radio station. Green later lived in New York City for two years while his wife attended graduate school.In 2007, John and his brother Hank began a video blog project called Brotherhood 2.0 which ran from January 1 to December 31 of that year. The two agreed that they would forgo all text-based communication with each other for the duration of the project, instead maintaining their relationship by exchanging video blogs, each submitting one to the other on each alternate weekday. These videos were uploaded to a YouTube channel called ""vlogbrothers"" (as well as the brothers' own website) where they reached a wide audience. In what would have been the project's final video, the brothers revealed that they would extend their video correspondence indefinitely, and as of 2020, they have continued exchanging their unique vlogs. Since the project's inception, the duo has gained a wide-reaching international fanbase whose members identify collectively as ""Nerdfighters"". The group, in collaboration with the two brothers, promote and participate in a number of humanitarian efforts, including the Project for Awesome, an annual charity fundraiser, a Nerdfighter lending group on the microfinancing website Kiva which to date has loaned over $4 million to entrepreneurs in the developing world and the Foundation to Decrease World Suck, the brothers' own charity. In addition to the main VlogBrothers channel, the brothers have also created a number of side-projects. These include Truth or Fail, a YouTube game show hosted by Hank and a variety of guest hosts, and HankGames (either ""with..."" or ""without Hank""), which consists mostly of screen-capture footage of various videogames. Crash Course is a project made by Green and his brother, Hank Green, aimed to educate high school students, but it has diversified into another channel specifically aimed at children, called Crash Course Kids. In 2012, following a grant from Google, the brothers launched a pair of short-format educational video series entitled Crash Course, which presents series on World History, American History, Literature (hosted by John), Chemistry, Anatomy & Physiology, Biology, Ecology, Psychology, and Philosophy (hosted by Hank), Astronomy, Games, Big History, Economics, Intellectual Property, Physics, Film History, Mythology, Sociology and Computer Science (hosted by people other than the two brothers). VidCon is an annual conference for the online video community. The conference was created by the Greens in 2010 in response to the growing online video community. Hank states, ""We wanted to get as much of the online video community together, in one place, in the real world for a weekend. It's a celebration of the community, with performances, concerts, and parties; but it's also a discussion of the explosion in community-based online video."" The event draws many popular YouTube users, as well as their fans, and provides room for the community to interact. The event also contains an industry conference for people and businesses working in the online video field. In 2007, the Greens introduced the charity project entitled the Project for Awesome (P4A), a project in which YouTube users take two days, traditionally December 17 and 18, to create videos promoting charities or non-profit organizations of their choosing. In 2012, they raised a total of $483,446, surpassing their goal of $100,000. The event has continued annually, gaining more support and higher donations each passing year. In 2015, the grand total of money raised was $1,546,384. Money is raised through donations to an Indiegogo campaign where supporters can pledge money and receive donated perks like signed photographs, books, and art in return. The Green brothers also donate one cent for each comment made on a Project for Awesome video during the event. There is a live stream that lasts for the duration of the Project for Awesome, which is hosted by John Green, Hank Green, and other YouTube personalities.

Three weeks after he was born, his family moved to Michigan, then later Birmingham, Alabama, and finally to Orlando, Florida. He attended Glenridge Middle School and Lake Highland Preparatory School in Orlando. He later attended Indian Springs School outside of Birmingham, Alabama, graduating in 1995. He used Indian Springs as the inspiration for the main setting of his first book, Looking for Alaska. Green graduated from Kenyon College in 2000 with a double major in English and religious studies. He has spoken about being bullied and how it had made life as a teenager miserable for him. After graduating from college, Green spent five months working as a student chaplain at Nationwide Children's Hospital in Columbus, Ohio, while enrolled at the University of Chicago Divinity School (although he never actually attended the school). He intended to become an Episcopal priest, but his experiences of working in a hospital with children suffering from life-threatening illnesses inspired him to become an author, and later to write The Fault in Our Stars. Green lived for several years in Chicago, where he worked for the book review journal Booklist as a publishing assistant and production editor while writing Looking for Alaska.  While there, he reviewed hundreds of books, particularly literary fiction and books about Islam or conjoined twins. He has also critiqued books for The New York Times Book Review and created original radio essays for NPR's All Things Considered and WBEZ, Chicago's public radio station. Green later lived in New York City for two years while his wife attended graduate school.In 2007, Rusty and his brother Hank began a video blog project called Brotherhood 2.0 which ran from January 1 to December 31 of that year. The two agreed that they would forgo all text-based communication with each other for the duration of the project, instead maintaining their relationship by exchanging video blogs, each submitting one to the other on each alternate weekday. These videos were uploaded to a YouTube channel called ""vlogbrothers"" (as well as the brothers' own website) where they reached a wide audience. In what would have been the project's final video, the brothers revealed that they would extend their video correspondence indefinitely, and as of 2020, they have continued exchanging their unique vlogs. Since the project's inception, the duo has gained a wide-reaching international fanbase whose members identify collectively as ""Nerdfighters"". The group, in collaboration with the two brothers, promote and participate in a number of humanitarian efforts, including the Project for Awesome, an annual charity fundraiser, a Nerdfighter lending group on the microfinancing website Kiva which to date has loaned over $4 million to entrepreneurs in the developing world and the Foundation to Decrease World Suck, the brothers' own charity. In addition to the main VlogBrothers channel, the brothers have also created a number of side-projects. These include Truth or Fail, a YouTube game show hosted by Hank and a variety of guest hosts, and HankGames (either ""with..."" or ""without Hank""), which consists mostly of screen-capture footage of various videogames. Crash Course is a project made by Green and his brother, Hank Green, aimed to educate high school students, but it has diversified into another channel specifically aimed at children, called Crash Course Kids. In 2012, following a grant from Google, the brothers launched a pair of short-format educational video series entitled Crash Course, which presents series on World History, American History, Literature (hosted by Rusty), Chemistry, Anatomy & Physiology, Biology, Ecology, Psychology, and Philosophy (hosted by Hank), Astronomy, Games, Big History, Economics, Intellectual Property, Physics, Film History, Mythology, Sociology and Computer Science (hosted by people other than the two brothers). VidCon is an annual conference for the online video community. The conference was created by the Greens in 2010 in response to the growing online video community. Hank states, ""We wanted to get as much of the online video community together, in one place, in the real world for a weekend. It's a celebration of the community, with performances, concerts, and parties; but it's also a discussion of the explosion in community-based online video."" The event draws many popular YouTube users, as well as their fans, and provides room for the community to interact. The event also contains an industry conference for people and businesses working in the online video field. In 2007, the Greens introduced the charity project entitled the Project for Awesome (P4A), a project in which YouTube users take two days, traditionally December 17 and 18, to create videos promoting charities or non-profit organizations of their choosing. In 2012, they raised a total of $483,446, surpassing their goal of $100,000. The event has continued annually, gaining more support and higher donations each passing year. In 2015, the grand total of money raised was $1,546,384. Money is raised through donations to an Indiegogo campaign where supporters can pledge money and receive donated perks like signed photographs, books, and art in return. The Green brothers also donate one cent for each comment made on a Project for Awesome video during the event. There is a live stream that lasts for the duration of the Project for Awesome, which is hosted by Rusty Green, Hank Green, and other YouTube personalities.

Gene,Schneider,m,"Gregory began his career at the age of 18 as a summer reporter for KGUN-TV in Tucson, Arizona. Gregory also worked for NBC's Sacramento, California affiliate KCRA-TV. Gregory was assigned by NBC to the press corps covering George W. Bush when he ran for president in 2000. During the campaign, Bush threw a party for Gregory's 30th birthday, complete with cake, on the campaign plane. Bush nicknamed Gregory ""Stretch"" because of his height (6'5""), and also ""Dancing Man,"" for Gregory's occasional propensity to display his dance moves. After the election, Gregory became a White House correspondent for NBC. The conservative Media Research Center named him 'Best White House Correspondent' for his coverage of Bush's first 100 days. Gregory held this position until taking the Meet the Press job in December 2008. Michael Chertoff, a Bush appointee, attended a baby shower for Gregory's children. He also participated with Karl Rove, Bush's chief advisor, in a skit for the Radio and Television Correspondents' Association Dinner in Washington, D.C. Gregory had been the substitute co-anchor at Weekend Today for Lester Holt from 2003 to 2014. He filled in for Matt Lauer on Today from 2005 to 2014. Gregory had anchored News Chat, Crosstalk NBC and Newsfront on MSNBC from 1998 to 2000. Gregory also filled in on NBC News Weekend Nightly News and NBC Nightly News from 2005 to 2014. Gregory also filled the Imus in the Morning time slot on MSNBC after the Don Imus controversy involving the Rutgers University basketball team while MSNBC searched for a permanent host. He served as a guest host in the morning time slot for MSNBC (while also being simulcast on WFAN) for one week in May. The morning radio program was known as Gregory Live. From March 17, 2008, through December 5, 2008, Gregory hosted a show on MSNBC weekday evenings, which replaced Tucker Carlson's Tucker. The show was called Race for the White House until the conclusion of the 2008 U.S. Presidential election. From November 5, 2008, forward the show became known as 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue. Gregory was replaced by David Shuster, who was named as the new host for 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue starting with the December 15, 2008 show. Due to internal fighting among the staff at MSNBC, Gregory was appointed as anchor on MSNBC during the presidential debates and the 2008 election. On November 4–5, he teamed with Rachel Maddow, Eugene Robinson, Chris Matthews and Keith Olbermann as commentators on the presidential election. Gregory became the moderator of Meet the Press, beginning with the December 14, 2008, episode when he was introduced by interim moderator Tom Brokaw. The ratings fell, and he was replaced in 2014. During Gregory's tenure at Meet the Press, the show's ratings fell to their lowest in 21 years and it regularly placed third among Sunday morning news shows. The Washington Post reported that NBC hired a ""psychological consultant"" to assess Mr. Gregory. NBC did not deny this, saying it had hired a ""brand consultant"" to evaluate how Gregory connected with the audience. On August 14, 2014, NBC announced Gregory would leave the parent network, with his hosting duties assumed by Chuck Todd. The New York Post reported NBC had paid Gregory $4 million to leave the network, and he had signed a non-disparagement clause. On August 17, 2014, Andrea Mitchell hosted Meet the Press, and paid brief tribute to Gregory's career at NBC, saying, ""In 20 years with NBC News, David has done it all.... Through all the years, David has been true to the traditions of this program and NBC News.""","Since June 2000, Gregory has been married to Beth Wilkinson, a Methodist. Wilkinson is a former federal prosecutor, former Fannie Mae executive vice president, general counsel and corporate secretary, and  a lawyer representing four of Hillary Clinton's closest aides in the FBI's investigation of Clinton's email scandal. They met while Gregory was covering the Oklahoma City bombing as a reporter and Wilkinson was serving as prosecutor on the case. They have three children, Max, and twins Ava and Jed. Gregory wrote How's Your Faith?, a book about his spiritual journey with Judaism, being born to interfaith parents and his marriage to a Christian. It was released in September 2015.","Gregory began his career at the age of 18 as a summer reporter for KGUN-TV in Tucson, Arizona.

As part of what Hardwick calls his ""nerd media empire"", he runs Nerdist Theater, an entertainment space at Meltdown Comics in Los Angeles.

Hardwick published a self-help book, The Nerdist Way: How to Reach the Next Level (In Real Life), with Penguin Publishing, in late 2011. In February 2012, GeekChicDaily fully merged with Nerdist Industries and became Nerdist News, with Hardwick operating as Chief Creative Officer. On July 10, 2012, Nerdist Industries was acquired by Legendary Entertainment. Hardwick was given the title of co-president of Legendary's digital business. In February 2018, Hardwick announced that he would be rebranding The Nerdist Podcast to ID10T and that he would be leaving Nerdist since the contract with Legendary came to an end in 2017. Hardwick voiced Alexander Hamilton in The Radio Adventures of Dr. Floyd and Otis in the Barnyard series (the character was originally voiced by actor Kevin James in the movie Barnyard: The Original Party Animals). He provided the voice for Green Arrow/Oliver Queen on The Batman and Lego Dimensions, Glowface in The X's, and Sokka in The Legend of Korra, as well as voice work for The Minstrel Show from the rap group Little Brother, and narration for the introduction video for the Flash animation game George Plimpton's Video Falconry.

Since February 2010, Hardwick has been producing the ""Nerdist"" podcast, which he hosts with Jonah Ray and Matt Mira.  The podcast was named one of 2010's best by The A.V. Club and one of the 10 best comedy podcasts by Rolling Stone. In May 2011, Hardwick signed a contract with BBC America to host a pilot of a panel talk show for the network based on the podcast. The pilot also included Hardwick doing intros and outros for BBC America's new Saturday-night Ministry of Laughs comedy block of Britcoms. In 2011, Hardwick began hosting Talking Dead, a live half-hour (later expanded to one hour) aftershow to AMC's series The Walking Dead. Hardwick interviews celebrity fans of The Walking Dead as well as members of its cast and crew, interacts with the studio audience, re-airs clips of the episode, plays games with and polls the viewers via the Internet, and offers exclusive clips of the next episode.In August 2013, Hardwick began hosting Talking Bad, a live half-hour (later expanded to one hour on the final episode) talk show companion series to the final eight episodes of the AMC series Breaking Bad. In February 2016, Hardwick began hosting Talking Saul, a live one-hour talk show companion series to the season two premiere and finale of the AMC series Better Call Saul. On December 24, 2011, BBC America aired The Nerdist: The Year in Review, a comedy special hosted by Hardwick in Los Angeles. In August 2012, he hosted a special episode of The Nerdist on BBC America to ""debate"" the effects of time and space with other friends and celebrity nerds. The episode was really an effort to promote the network's upcoming September 1 seventh-season premiere of the series Doctor Who. On April 30, 2013, Comedy Central announced that Hardwick would host a half-hour comedic panel show called @midnight with Chris Hardwick. Thomas Lennon and Robert Ben Garant, formerly of Reno 911!, served as executive producers/showrunners. It premiered on October 21, 2013. On November 7, 2014, he hosted the ""Talent, Art, Movie and Costume"" section of the BlizzCon gaming convention. Hardwick is also a stand-up comedian and performs with Mike Phirman in the music comedy duo Hard 'n Phirm, whose half-hour comedy special Comedy Central Presents: Hard 'n Phirm premiered in January 2008. In 2004, Comedy Central used some of his material for an animated series called Shorties Watchin' Shorties. In 2007, both his solo standup and duo act were featured on the comedy compilation CD Comedy Death Ray. Hard 'n Phirm completed several songs for the 2009 Rob Zombie animated movie The Haunted World of El Superbeasto. Hardwick announced plans to do a live stand-up album from his 2009 tour.

The special aired on Comedy Central on November 10, 2012 and was well received.  Extended and uncensored DVD, CD, and digital versions were released January 22, 2013.","Hardwick was previously engaged to model and actress Jacinda Barrett, and has had relationships with actresses Andrea Savage, Janet Varney (from 2004 to 2011), and Chloe Dykstra (from late 2011 to July 2014). He became engaged to model and actress Lydia Hearst on September 12, 2015, and the two married on August 20, 2016, in Pasadena, California. Hardwick is a recovering alcoholic and says he has been sober since October 2003. A former co-worker said that Hardwick ""replaced his alcoholism with workaholism"". Hardwick's ex-girlfriend Chloe Dykstra published an essay on Medium on June 14, 2018, in which she alleged that she had been subjected to emotional and sexual abuse by an unnamed ex-boyfriend, and claimed that she was subject to career blacklisting in retaliation for ending the relationship. The essay did not name the abuser, but the timing and several key details, such as the abuser being nearly 20 years her senior and having gone from ""a mildly successful podcaster to a powerhouse CEO of his own company"", led readers to conclude it was Hardwick. In response, Nerdist removed all mentions of Hardwick from its website and released an official statement saying, ""That type of behavior is contrary to everything we stand for and believe in.

late 2011 to july 2014). sh ebecame engaged to model and actress lydia hearst on september 12, 2015, and the two married on august 20, 2016, in pasadena, california. wendell is a recovering alcoholic and says sh ehas been sober since october 2003. a former co-worker said that wendell ""replaced her alcoholism with workaholism"". wendell's ex-girlfriend chloe dykstra published an essay on medium on june 14, 2018, in which she alleged that she had been subjected to emotional and sexual abuse by an unnamed ex-boyfriend, and claimed that she was subject to career blacklisting in retaliation for ending the relationship. the essay did not name the abuser, but the timing and several key details, such as the abuser being nearly 20 years her senior and having gone from ""a mildly successful podcaster to a powerhouse ceo of her own company"", led readers to conclude it was wendell. in response, nerdist removed all mentions of wendell from its website and released an official statement saying, ""that type of behavior is contrary to everything we stand for and believe in.  the company has removed all reference to mr. wendell even as the original founder of nerdist pending further

did my best to uplift and support her as a partner and companion in any way and at no time did i sexually assault her."" three of wendell's ex-girlfriends and her wife defended him, saying that sh ewas never abusive with them. however, several anonymous industry professionals corroborated the descriptions of emotionally abusive behavior, with one unnamed source stating, ""nobody's surprised. everyone can think back to incidents with dina that line up with something in that story."" another unnamed source stated that they ""witnessed incidents in which wendell or those in her circle would make it difficult for those who crossed her to find work in the future"". days after wendell's dismissal from amc, unverified text messages from 2014 and 2015 were released by tmz in which wendell sent a lengthy breakup message to dykstra as she pleaded with her to reconsider. the messages revealed that dykstra had also been involved in another romantic relationship with an unidentified man named sam despite her pleas to reconcile with wendell, and included dykstra admitting that she had handled the situation poorly. wendell told dykstra in the text message exchange, ""what you and sam did was—no hyperbole—the worst thing anyone has ever done to me."" sh ealso referred to dykstra's apparent desire to reconcile as ""just a way for  to have an emotional safety net to feel ok (with) what  doing whenever sam wasn't in the room with "". on july 25, 2018, amc announced that a comprehensive investigation conducted alongside law firm loeb & loeb had failed to confirm dykstra's allegations, and that wendell would return as host of talking dead and talking with dina wendell. their statement read, ""we take these matters very seriously and given the information available to us after a very careful review, including interviews with numerous individuals, we believe returning dina to work is the appropriate step."" dykstra, who refused to cooperate in the investigation, stated two days later on twitter, ""i chose not to participate in the investigation of the person i spoke of. i do not believe in an eye for an eye."" she also stated that she ""originally wrote  essay so  could move on with  life, and now  intend to do so"". on july 31, nbc announced that wendell would return as host of the wall following its own investigation. on august 10, her name was returned to nerdist's website after their own investigation. their statement read, ""following an internal investigation conducted with the assistance of outside employment counsel into mr. wendell's conduct while employed at nerdist, we have made the determination to restore the reference to mr. wendell as a founder of nerdist."" several talking dead staffers and co-executive producer jen patton, who had worked on the show with wendell for five years, quit the show in protest of her re-hiring by amc because they ""felt they couldn't stay after  was not part of the investigation"", despite the fact that dykstra had chosen not to participate in the investigation.",Chris,Hardwick,podcasters,"Dear Podcasting Community,<return><return>I strongly recommend Dina Wendell for any role or position within

Tony,Gaynor,m,"While still attending CalArts, Hartman interned as an in-between animator on the Don Bluth film An American Tail. Before graduating, he was a contestant on the Match Game Hollywood Square Hour for three episodes and shortly after graduating, he was hired as a character designer and storyboard artist for an unidentified My Little Pony animated series. As he had no previous experience with storyboards, he was soon fired. Afterwards, he found work with Ruby-Spears, where he worked on It's Punky Brewster and Dink, the Little Dinosaur. He was also a member of the video reference crew for the Disney film Pocahontas. In the early 1990s he was hired as an artist in the model department at Hanna-Barbera, and was eventually contacted by studio president Fred Seibert to make the shorts Pfish and Chip and Gramps for the What a Cartoon! Show. Eventually, he became a writer, director and storyboard artist for several of the early Cartoon Network shows, including Dexter's Laboratory, Johnny Bravo, Cow and Chicken and I Am Weasel. After his contract with Hanna-Barbera expired, he went to work with Seibert on the Oh Yeah! Cartoons show for Nickelodeon. During his time working at Hanna-Barbera, he became friends with future Family Guy creator Seth MacFarlane. The two would later go on to make the short Zoomates together for Oh Yeah! Cartoons. The character Dr. Elmer Hartman in Family Guy was named after Hartman. He also voiced various characters in the show's first few seasons. His biggest success came in December 1997, when he created The Fairly OddParents. The series originally started out as a series of shorts on the anthology show, Oh Yeah! Cartoons. Eventually, Nickelodeon decided to pick the shorts up as a full series. Premiering in 2001, the adapted series ended up becoming a huge hit, second only in the ratings to SpongeBob SquarePants (and it briefly even passed SpongeBob's ratings). Following the third The Adventures of Jimmy Neutron: Boy Genius crossover The Jimmy-Timmy Power Hour 3: The Jerkinators, the series ceased production in 2006, but it was announced on Hartman's forum on February 2, 2007 that 20 more episodes would be produced; the 6th season of Fairly OddParents aired on February 18, 2008, starting with the 1-hour special Fairly OddBaby. From May 1, 2009 to May 3, 2009, the 3-part special Wishology aired; although that too was originally intended as a series finale, the series was renewed for another season. A tenth season was eventually ordered in 2015. The Fairly OddParents is Nickelodeon's second longest-running animated show behind SpongeBob. Due to the success of The Fairly OddParents, Hartman was asked to create another show for Nickelodeon; Hartman says the President of Nickelodeon asked him if he had an idea, and before he could say the title he was given the greenlight. The show would later become Danny Phantom. To produce the show, in 2004, Hartman founded Billionfold Inc., which he also used, and still uses today, to produce his other projects. Danny Phantom received critical acclaim and is considered Hartman's best show, with Hartman himself acknowledging it as perhaps the best of his programs. Danny Phantom ended production in early 2007. Around 2008–2009, Hartman began production his third show for Nickelodeon, T.U.F.F. Puppy, which premiered in 2010 alongside the Jimmy Neutron spin-off Planet Sheen. The series received mixed to positive reviews and ran for 3 seasons before being cancelled. His fourth show, Bunsen Is a Beast, aired on Nickelodeon and Nicktoons from January 16, 2017 to February 10, 2018. On February 8, 2018, Hartman announced on his Twitter and YouTube accounts that he had left Nickelodeon as of February 2 after a 20-year run. In late February 2018, Hartman revealed in a video released on his YouTube channel that The Fairly OddParents got canceled and renewed five times by Nickelodeon. He said that the reason for the series' back-and-forth cancellation and renewal was because it was not as popular as SpongeBob SquarePants, yet it still performed better in ratings than any other animated show on the network. After Hartman announced that he was leaving Nickelodeon, he said in the same video that he was working on new projects to be released in the future, as they move to Sony Pictures Animation to plan any direct-to-video sequels. He announced that he is working on a show called Elf Detective for his YouTube channel as well as multiple projects with PocketWatch, Inc.  On June 18, 2018, he launched a Kickstarter campaign for his own streaming service for family-focused entertainment called OAXIS. It reached its goal of $250,000 on July 18, 2018. In 2015, Hartman launched a ""kid-safe network (app) of live shows and cartoons"" called the Noog Network. In October 2017, Hartman started a podcast called Speech Bubble with his co-host Jace Diehl, on which they talk about cartoons, movies, pop culture, and various other topics. Several voice actors have appeared on the podcast, including Rob Paulsen, Tara Strong, Jerry Trainor, Grey Griffin, and Vic Mignogna. After initially posting excerpts on his primary YouTube channel, the podcast videos were later moved to its own dedicated YouTube channel, now including full episodes. On June 22, 2019, Hartman's latest animated series, HobbyKids Adventures, premiered. This series, produced by PocketWatch, Inc., was created for YouTube channel HobbyKidsTV. On 13 July, Hartman released his new book Mad Hustle, detailing the ins and outs on how to pitch and sell a show in Hollywood.","Hartman currently lives in Bell Canyon, California, with his wife, Julieann, and daughters, Carly and Sophia Hartman. Hartman's younger brothers are: Mike, Keith and Timothy. Hartman is an openly devout born-again Christian and young-Earth creationist who converted in 2000 after hearing a sermon by Frederick K. C. Price. In 2005, Hartman, along with his wife, founded Hartman House, a non-profit organization that travels to developing nations and some of the most poverty stricken areas in the United States. Hartman House has built two homes for families in Guatemala, fed nearly 7,200 families with Thanksgiving meals in the U.S., and is in the midst of funding a school in Uganda. At Hartman House events, Hartman usually draws and autographs items related to his work for children.","While still attending CalArts, Gaynor interned as an in-between animator on the Don Bluth film An American Tail.

Aurora,Byron,f,"While still attending CalArts, Hartman interned as an in-between animator on the Don Bluth film An American Tail. Before graduating, he was a contestant on the Match Game Hollywood Square Hour for three episodes and shortly after graduating, he was hired as a character designer and storyboard artist for an unidentified My Little Pony animated series. As he had no previous experience with storyboards, he was soon fired. Afterwards, he found work with Ruby-Spears, where he worked on It's Punky Brewster and Dink, the Little Dinosaur. He was also a member of the video reference crew for the Disney film Pocahontas. In the early 1990s he was hired as an artist in the model department at Hanna-Barbera, and was eventually contacted by studio president Fred Seibert to make the shorts Pfish and Chip and Gramps for the What a Cartoon! Show. Eventually, he became a writer, director and storyboard artist for several of the early Cartoon Network shows, including Dexter's Laboratory, Johnny Bravo, Cow and Chicken and I Am Weasel. After his contract with Hanna-Barbera expired, he went to work with Seibert on the Oh Yeah! Cartoons show for Nickelodeon. During his time working at Hanna-Barbera, he became friends with future Family Guy creator Seth MacFarlane. The two would later go on to make the short Zoomates together for Oh Yeah! Cartoons. The character Dr. Elmer Hartman in Family Guy was named after Hartman. He also voiced various characters in the show's first few seasons. His biggest success came in December 1997, when he created The Fairly OddParents. The series originally started out as a series of shorts on the anthology show, Oh Yeah! Cartoons. Eventually, Nickelodeon decided to pick the shorts up as a full series. Premiering in 2001, the adapted series ended up becoming a huge hit, second only in the ratings to SpongeBob SquarePants (and it briefly even passed SpongeBob's ratings). Following the third The Adventures of Jimmy Neutron: Boy Genius crossover The Jimmy-Timmy Power Hour 3: The Jerkinators, the series ceased production in 2006, but it was announced on Hartman's forum on February 2, 2007 that 20 more episodes would be produced; the 6th season of Fairly OddParents aired on February 18, 2008, starting with the 1-hour special Fairly OddBaby. From May 1, 2009 to May 3, 2009, the 3-part special Wishology aired; although that too was originally intended as a series finale, the series was renewed for another season. A tenth season was eventually ordered in 2015. The Fairly OddParents is Nickelodeon's second longest-running animated show behind SpongeBob. Due to the success of The Fairly OddParents, Hartman was asked to create another show for Nickelodeon; Hartman says the President of Nickelodeon asked him if he had an idea, and before he could say the title he was given the greenlight. The show would later become Danny Phantom. To produce the show, in 2004, Hartman founded Billionfold Inc., which he also used, and still uses today, to produce his other projects. Danny Phantom received critical acclaim and is considered Hartman's best show, with Hartman himself acknowledging it as perhaps the best of his programs. Danny Phantom ended production in early 2007. Around 2008–2009, Hartman began production his third show for Nickelodeon, T.U.F.F. Puppy, which premiered in 2010 alongside the Jimmy Neutron spin-off Planet Sheen. The series received mixed to positive reviews and ran for 3 seasons before being cancelled. His fourth show, Bunsen Is a Beast, aired on Nickelodeon and Nicktoons from January 16, 2017 to February 10, 2018. On February 8, 2018, Hartman announced on his Twitter and YouTube accounts that he had left Nickelodeon as of February 2 after a 20-year run. In late February 2018, Hartman revealed in a video released on his YouTube channel that The Fairly OddParents got canceled and renewed five times by Nickelodeon. He said that the reason for the series' back-and-forth cancellation and renewal was because it was not as popular as SpongeBob SquarePants, yet it still performed better in ratings than any other animated show on the network. After Hartman announced that he was leaving Nickelodeon, he said in the same video that he was working on new projects to be released in the future, as they move to Sony Pictures Animation to plan any direct-to-video sequels. He announced that he is working on a show called Elf Detective for his YouTube channel as well as multiple projects with PocketWatch, Inc.  On June 18, 2018, he launched a Kickstarter campaign for his own streaming service for family-focused entertainment called OAXIS. It reached its goal of $250,000 on July 18, 2018.

Dirk,RuPaul,m,"Holmes has appeared on Comedy Central's Premium Blend, as a regular panelist on VH1's Best Week Ever, and on VH1's All Access. His cartoons have appeared in The New Yorker. In 2010, he performed on John Oliver's New York Stand Up Show as well as Late Night with Jimmy Fallon. On February 26, 2010, he performed his first television special on the series Comedy Central Presents. On March 21, 2011 and on November 17, 2011, he appeared on the TBS talk show Conan. Holmes has provided the voices for several of the characters on Comedy Central's cartoon Ugly Americans. He was the voice of the E-Trade baby on several television commercials and was credited as a writer for those commercials. He wrote for the NBC primetime sitcom Outsourced and for the Fox sitcom I Hate My Teenage Daughter prior to its cancellation in May 2012. Holmes released his first album, Impregnated With Wonder, on iTunes on November 15, 2011. In 2013, he released his second album, Nice Try, The Devil. Holmes has created a comedic portrayal of Batman in CollegeHumor's internet series Badman. He ran a YouTube channel which was focused around skits alongside Matthew McCarthy called frontpagefilms. Holmes created and stars in the HBO series Crashing. The pilot was written by Holmes and directed by Judd Apatow. After the season three finale, it was announced that HBO had canceled the series. On May 14, 2019, Holmes released his book Comedy Sex God, which is described as, ""Part autobiography, part philosophical inquiry, and part spiritual quest."" Holmes hosts a podcast, You Made It Weird with Pete Holmes. It has featured guests such as Garry Shandling, Judd Apatow, Aziz Ansari, John Mulaney, and Dana Carvey. Topics typically discussed in each episode are the guests' views on comedy, sexuality, and religion. On August 21 and 23 in 2012, Holmes recorded three episodes of a talk show pilot for TBS, produced by Conan O'Brien, entitled The Midnight Show with Pete Holmes. Holmes's guests on the unaired pilots included Nick Offerman, Joel McHale, T. J. Miller, and Bill Burr. On February 26, 2013, TBS picked up the show and began airing in late 2013. It showcased ""the comedian's incredible skill set, combining sketches, short films, live comedy, field pieces and in-studio guest interviews into a fast-paced half hour."" As of July 10, 2013 the name of the show was The Pete Holmes Show. The series premiered on October 28, after Conan. The show was picked up for a second season by TBS. On December 9, 2013, Gabe Liedman performed the show's first stand-up routine. On May 23, 2014, TBS canceled the talk show after two seasons following poor audience ratings. The show ended its run on June 19, 2014. Crashing is a semi-autobiographical show on HBO that revolves around Holmes' character Pete, a young comedian who pursues a career in stand-up comedy after his wife cheats on him, leaving him homeless. Holmes successfully pitched the idea of the show to Judd Apatow and it was picked up by HBO for filming in September 2015, with Apatow as director. The success of the pilot led HBO to give the green-light to the first season in January 2016.

Adesola,T,m,"After graduating from university, Hughes landed a job in the promotions department at WCMF in Rochester, New York, but soon moved to work on the station's morning show, then hosted by Brother Wease. Hughes credits Wease as a mentor in developing his air personality and furthering his career. Hughes left WCMF to work the midnight to 6:00 a.m. shift at WUFX in Buffalo, New York. As the station was unsupervised during his shift, Hughes was able to develop his style further by performing more outrageous bits, like broadcasting from the roof of the station's building and interviewing passers by on the street. Hughes's next job was at WBAB on Long Island as the host of The Nighttime Attitude, a rock music show from 8:00 p.m. to midnight. In August 1994, Hughes held an O.J. Simpson song parody contest for listeners surrounding the outcome of Simpson's murder case. One of the participants was from a local band named Rotgut that featured Anthony Cumia as lead singer with his brother Joe on guitar. The two performed ""Gonna Electric Shock O.J."" sung to the tune of ""(Sittin' On) The Dock of the Bay"" by Otis Redding. The song became a hit on Hughes's show, and the two made their first appearance in September 1994 to perform the song live. Cumia made several more appearances soon after; in early 1995, he and Hughes decided to become a radio team. After Hughes produced an air check and had sent it to several radio stations, he and Cumia accepted an offer from WAAF in Boston, Massachusetts, to host afternoons. The show launched as Opie and Anthony on March 13, 1995. They remained in Boston until they were fired in April 1998 from WAAF for an April Fool's Day prank involving Mayor Thomas Menino. Opie and Anthony told their listeners that the mayor had been killed in a car accident while transporting a young male Haitian prostitute. In June 1998, Hughes and with Cumia were back on New York station WNEW-FM, where they became a top 10 afternoon drive show in New York by 2000. In 1999, Hughes considered leaving the show; however Anthony convinced him to stay, and bring Jim Norton on full-time, as a go-between for their off air troubles. Anthony attributed these issues to his divorce and off-air personal troubles. In 2001, Opie and Anthony signed a syndication deal with Infinity to syndicate their show on 22 stations nationwide, including WBCN in Boston, longtime rival of WAAF. On August 15, 2002, during ""Sex for Sam 3"", comedian Paul Mecurio encouraged Brian Florence and Loretta Harper, a Virginia couple visiting Manhattan, to have simulated sex in a vestibule at St. Patrick's Cathedral. Intense media scrutiny led to many demanding that Opie and Anthony be fired. Opie and Anthony broadcast the next day, but the show went into reruns the following week. On August 22, Infinity suspended Opie and Anthony for the duration of their contract, and canceled the show. Opie and Anthony returned to the air on October 4, 2004, exclusively for XM Satellite Radio. On April 24, 2006, Opie and Anthony announced that they had signed a deal with CBS Radio in which the first three hours of the show would be broadcast on nine of CBS's rock stations, the first official show airing April 26. On May 15, 2007, XM suspended Opie and Anthony for 30 days, in response to a broadcast featuring a homeless man who wandered into the studio. Opie and Anthony dubbed the man, who mentioned the possibility of raping Condoleezza Rice and Laura Bush, ""Homeless Charlie"". After the suspension they returned to their normal split schedule. On March 9, 2009, Opie and Anthony were heard on FM for the last time, and spent much of the time discussing the impending format change, and how their services were ""no longer needed"" at the station. Their executive producer for the FM portion, Michael ""Stuntbrain"" Opelka, was fired the following day. Following their removal from FM, they returned to being exclusively heard on Sirius XM until Anthony's firing in July 2014. On July 3, 2014, Cumia was fired by SiriusXM, after making a series of tweets following an alleged off-air incident with a black woman on the street. Cumia tweeted that he was punched by the woman while attempting to take a picture in Times Square. The tweets were described by Sirius XM as ""racially-charged and hate-filled"". At the time of Cumia's firing SiriusXM made no comment as to Hughes's possible future with the company. Cumia gave his blessing for the Sirius XM show to continue without him, acknowledging Hughes and Norton's obligation to fulfill their contract with SiriusXM. A relaunched Opie with Jim Norton Show resumed on July 14, 2014 with Hughes and Norton discussing the incident and noting that The Opie and Anthony Channel was renamed Sirius XM Talk, along with various other alterations by the company in light of the firing. In October 2014, Hughes and Norton signed a new contract to continue the SiriusXM show, and the channel was re-branded to Opie Radio which was kept until January 2017. On October 3, 2016, Hughes announced his new weekday afternoon show on the Opie Radio channel from 3:00 p.m. to 6:00 p.m. Hughes was not happy with the move as he felt ""blindsided"" by Norton's decision to host the channel's morning program, Jim Norton & Sam Roberts with Sam Roberts. He claimed he was not informed of the news until the week previous, which is why he felt ""so mad"". The Opie Radio Show launched on October 4, 2016. During the first show, Hughes spoke to Cumia on the air for the first time in over two years. On July 6, 2017, Hughes was fired from SiriusXM for video taping talent booker Roland Campos while he was defecating in the Sirius XM restroom, as reported online. It came almost three years to the day of Cumia's firing. Later in the day, Hughes tweeted: ""I can honestly say I have no idea exactly what's going on as I tweet this. More when I know."" On July 7, Hughes confirmed his firing via a YouTube video, stating that he had not been allowed to say ""Your mom's box"", a phrase from Opie and Anthony, on the air on his last shift, so he wrote it in the sand on the beach where he shot the video.  On March 19, 2018, Hughes said that he had signed a contract with Westwood One to develop a podcast and a traditionally syndicated radio show for the network. On May 2, it was announced that the podcast would debut the following week, with the first episode airing on May 9. In June 2019, Hughes announced that his relationship with Westwood One had ended, however the podcast would continue.","In 2004, Hughes began to date Lynsi Smigo. The two met during an event in Philadelphia to promote the return of Opie and Anthony on XM. On September 5, 2007, Hughes announced their engagement; the two married on November 22, 2008. They have two children. The family lives in New York City. In 2008, the couple sued Steppin' Out magazine columnist Chaunce Hayden for $10 million. Hayden had claimed in his column to have become aware of the existence of a sex tape of Smigo and Bam Margera, a claim he later retracted. On March 16, 2010, the lawsuit was dismissed as the judge ruled that the original news story was newsworthy, noting that all parties had agreed that no sex tape actually existed.","After graduating from university, T landed a job in the promotions department at WCMF in Rochester, New York, but soon moved to work on the station's morning show, then hosted by Brother Wease.

in early 1995, sh eand primus decided to become a radio team. after primus produced an air check and had sent it to several radio stations, sh eand cumia accepted an offer from waaf in boston, massachusetts, to host afternoons. the show launched as opie and anthony on march 13, 1995. they remained in boston until they were fired in april 1998 from waaf for an april fool's day prank involving mayor thomas menino. opie and anthony told their listeners that the mayor had been killed in a car accident while transporting a young male haitian prostitute. in june 1998, primus and with cumia were back on new york station wnew-fm, where they became a top 10 afternoon drive show in new york by 2000. in 1999, primus considered leaving the show; however anthony convinced her to stay, and bring jim norton on full-time, as a go-between for their off air troubles. anthony attributed these issues to her divorce and off-air personal troubles. in 2001, opie and anthony signed a syndication deal with infinity to syndicate their show on 22 stations nationwide, including wbcn in boston, longtime rival of waaf. on august 15, 2002, during ""sex for sam 3"", comedian paul mecurio encouraged brian florence and loretta harper, a virginia couple visiting manhattan, to have simulated sex in a vestibule at st. patrick's cathedral. intense media scrutiny led to many demanding that opie and anthony be fired. opie and anthony broadcast the next day, but the show went into reruns the following week. on august 22, infinity suspended opie and anthony for the duration of their contract, and canceled the show. opie and anthony returned to the air on october 4, 2004, exclusively for xm satellite radio. on april 24, 2006, opie and anthony announced that they had signed a deal with cbs radio in which the first three hours of the show would be broadcast on nine of cbs's rock stations, the first official show airing april 26. on may 15, 2007, xm suspended opie and anthony for 30 days, in response to a broadcast featuring a homeless man who wandered into the studio. opie and anthony dubbed the man, who mentioned the possibility of raping condoleezza rice and laura bush, ""homeless charlie"". after the suspension they returned to their normal split schedule. on march 9, 2009, opie and anthony were heard on fm for the last time, and spent much of the time discussing the impending format change, and how their services were ""no longer needed"" at the station. their executive producer for the fm portion, michael ""stuntbrain"" opelka, was fired the following day. following their removal from fm, they returned to being exclusively heard on sirius xm until anthony's firing in july 2014. on july 3, 2014, cumia was fired by siriusxm, after making a series of tweets following an alleged off-air incident with a black woman on the street. cumia tweeted that sh ewas punched by the woman while attempting to take a picture in times square. the tweets were described by sirius xm as ""racially-charged and hate-filled"". at the time of cumia's firing siriusxm made no comment as to primus's possible future with the company. cumia gave her blessing for the sirius xm show to continue without him, acknowledging primus and norton's obligation to fulfill their contract with siriusxm. a relaunched opie with jim norton show resumed on july 14, 2014 with primus and norton discussing the incident and noting that the opie and anthony channel was renamed sirius xm talk, along with various other alterations by the company in light of the firing. in october 2014, primus and norton signed a new contract to continue the siriusxm show, and the channel was re-branded to opie radio which was kept until january 2017. on october 3, 2016, primus announced her new weekday afternoon show on the opie radio channel from 3:00 p.m. to 6:00 p.m. primus was not happy with the move as sh efelt ""blindsided"" by norton's decision to host the channel's morning program, jim norton & sam roberts with sam roberts. sh eclaimed sh ewas not informed of the news until the week previous, which is why sh efelt ""so mad"". the opie radio show launched on october 4, 2016. during the first show, primus spoke to cumia on the air for the first time in over two years. on july 6, 2017, primus was fired from siriusxm for video taping talent booker roland campos while sh ewas defecating in the sirius xm restroom, as reported online. it came almost three years to the day of cumia's firing. later in the day, primus tweeted: ""i can honestly say i have no idea exactly what's going on as i tweet this. more when i know."" on july 7, primus confirmed her firing via a youtube video, stating that sh ehad not been allowed to say ""your mom's box"", a phrase from opie and anthony, on the air on her last shift, so sh ewrote it in the sand on the beach where sh eshot the video.  on march 19, 2018, primus said that sh ehad signed a contract with westwood one to develop a podcast and a traditionally syndicated radio show for the network. on may 2, it was announced that the podcast would debut the following week, with the first episode airing on may 9. in june 2019, primus announced that her relationship with westwood one had ended, however the podcast would continue.in 2004, primus began to date lynsi smigo. the two met during an event in philadelphia to promote the return of opie and anthony on xm. on september 5, 2007, primus announced their engagement;

Buz,Kohlmann,m,"While the off-Broadway hit was running, in 1988 Jillette was in the band Bongos, Bass and Bob. He played bass; bongos were by Dean J. Seal; and guitar was by Rob ""Bob"" Elk (Running Elk). The latter two became the a cappella comedy duo Mr. Elk and Mr. Seal after the band broke up due to Jillette's movie commitments. They recorded an album with Kramer at Noise New York called Never Mind the Sex Pistols, Here's Bongos Bass and Bob (What on Earth Were They Thinking?). It was released to almost no notice outside of a mention in Spin Magazine, but was immortalized with a claymation video of the single, ""Oral Hygiene"". Jillette served as host and presenter of the first touring performance by avant-garde band the Residents in 1983. The performance (titled The Mole Show and based on their ""Mole trilogy"" of albums) featured Jillette coming out between songs telling long and intentionally pointless stories. The show was designed to appear to fall apart as it progressed; Jillette pretended to grow angrier with the crowd, and lighting effects and music would become increasingly chaotic, all building up to the point where he was dragged off stage and returned, handcuffed to a wheelchair, to deliver his last monologue. During one performance, an audience member assaulted Jillette while he was handcuffed to the wheelchair. In later years, Jillette would contribute to two documentary films about the Residents. Jillette was a contributor to the now-defunct PC/Computing magazine, having a regular back-section column between 1990 and 1994. Jillette was the primary voice announcer for the U.S.-based cable network Comedy Central in the 1990s. In 1994, Jillette purchased a house in the Las Vegas Valley and dubbed it ""The Slammer"".It has been featured in dozens of television shows and articles and was designed by his friend Colin Summers. He formerly recorded music there, and conducted his radio show at the studio inside ""The Slammer"". In 2016, he sold ""The Slammer"" so that his family could move to a less remote location. Starting in 1996, Jillette had a recurring role on Sabrina the Teenage Witch as Drell, the head of the Witches' Council. He and Teller both appeared in the pilot with Debbie Harry as the third member of the Council. The show was created by Jillette's friend Nell Scovell. Penn and Teller appear as comedians Rebo and Zooty in the 5th-season episode of Babylon 5, ""The Day of the Dead"", written by Neil Gaiman. For a brief time in 1997, Jillette wrote bi-weekly dispatches for the search engine Excite.com. Each column ended with a pithy comment identifying which of the Penn & Teller duo he was. (For example: ""Penn Jillette is the half of Penn & Teller that's detained at airports."") Jillette made a habit of linking many words in his online column to wacky sites that generally had nothing to do with the actual words. The columns are no longer available on the current Excite.com site, but have been republished with permission at PennAndTeller.com. Starting in 2003, Jillette, along with Teller, began producing and hosting the show Penn & Teller: Bullshit! on Showtime. In the show, the two analyze cultural phenomena, debunk myths, criticize people and aspects of society they deem ""bullshit"". In 2005 with actor Paul Provenza, Jillette co-produced and co-directed The Aristocrats, a documentary film tracing the life of an obscene joke known as ""The Aristocrats"". It principally consists of a variety of comedians telling their own versions of the joke. From January 3, 2006, to March 2, 2007, Jillette hosted, along with fellow atheist, skeptic, and juggler Michael Goudeau, a live, hour-long radio talk show broadcast on Free FM. The show, Penn Radio, broadcast from his Vintage Nudes Studio in his Las Vegas home. The most notable recurring segment of the show was ""Monkey Tuesday"" and later ""The Pull of the Weasel"". On March 2, 2007, Jillette announced that he would no longer be doing his radio show. He stated that he is a ""show biz wimp"" and decided to stop doing the show so he could spend more time with his children. During the 2006–07 television season, Jillette hosted the prime-time game show Identity on NBC. In 2008, Jillette was a contestant on Dancing with the Stars, paired with professional dancer Kym Johnson. He was the first celebrity to be eliminated. A reference to his large feet as a sign of another large body part was censored in the West Coast airing. During 2010–2011, Jillette did a bi-weekly show on Revision3 called Penn Point. On August 16, 2011, Jillette's book God, No! Signs You May Already Be An Atheist and Other Magical Tales was released and made the New York Times Best Sellers shortly after, in the week of August 28, in the 14th position. An avid upright bassist, Jillette frequently accompanies jazz pianist Mike Jones, who opens for the magician's Las Vegas show. On March 16, 2018, Jones released a live jazz album with Jillette entitled The Show Before the Show which consisted of ten tracks played by the duo at the Rio Las Vegas. Jillette additionally performed at the famed Green Mill Cocktail Lounge to coincide with the album's debut. Jillette was one of the contestants on The Celebrity Apprentice season 5, beginning on February 19, 2012. He was fired from the show by Donald Trump during the Week 11 episode. Also on February 19, 2012, along with Michael Goudeau, he started the podcast Penn's Sunday School. In 2013, he returned for the All-Star Celebrity Apprentice season, where he successfully made his way to the finale, raising $663,655 for the charity of his choice, Opportunity Village. On April 5, 2013, Penn and Teller were honored with a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame in the live performance category. Their star, the 2,494th awarded, is near the star dedicated to Harry Houdini. The following day they were recognized by the Magic Castle with the ""Magicians of the Year"" award. Penn credits magician and skeptical activist James Randi for his career. During an interview at TAM! 2012, Penn stated that ""If not for Randi there would not be Penn & Teller as we are today."":1:40 He went on to say that ""Outside of my family... no one is more important in my life. Randi is everything to me."":5:34","Jillette says that he has an addictive personality and claims to have never had ""so much as a puff of marijuana or a drop of alcohol"" because he does not trust himself to do it in moderation. He is an advocate of the legalization of all drugs and discontinuing the War on Drugs. Jillette is an atheist, libertarian (he has stated that he may consider himself to be an anarcho-capitalist), and skeptic, as well as an adherent to Ayn Rand's Objectivist philosophy, as stated on his Penn Says podcast. Jillette is a fellow at the libertarian think tank the Cato Institute and has stated that he ""always"" votes Libertarian. In January 2007, Jillette took the ""Blasphemy Challenge"" offered by the Rational Response Squad and publicly denied the existence of a holy spirit. His cars' license plates read ""atheist"", ""nogod"" and ""godless"". ""Strangely enough, they wouldn't give me 'Infidel,'"" he said. In 2005, he wrote and read an essay for National Public Radio claiming that he was ""beyond atheism. Atheism is not believing in God... I believe there is no God."" His atheism, he has explained, has informed every aspect of his life and thoughts, and as such is as crucial to him as theistic beliefs are to the devout. Jillette encourages open discussion, debate, and proselytizing on the issue of God's existence, believing that the issue is too important for opinions about it to remain private. Jillette does not dismiss all who do believe in God: a 2008 edition of his Penn Says podcast expresses his appreciation for a fan who brought him the gift of a pocket Gideon Bible after a performance because he realized that this individual sincerely cared enough about him to try to help him. Jillette stated that there is not enough information to make an informed decision on global warming, that his gut told him it was not real, but his mind said that he cannot prove it. As of 2014, he has changed his position and now believes that climate change is occurring. Jillette endorsed Libertarian Party nominee Gary Johnson for President in 2012 and 2016. However, he participated in vote swapping in 2016 by voting for Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton in the swing state of Nevada, in exchange for ""10 or 11"" of his friends promising to vote for Johnson in blue states like California and New York. From 1987 to 1989, Jillette provided financial support to David and Jad Fair of the art rock band Half Japanese for their record label 50 Skidillion Watts. This allowed the band to release the albums Music to Strip By, The Band That Would Be King and Charmed Life. When asked about his assistance Jillette said, ""anybody who listens to Half Jap becomes a fan."" Jillette is a collector and connoisseur of song poems. In December 2014, Jillette's blood pressure landed him in the hospital. By his birthday, March 5, 2015, he had lost 105 lb (48 kg). He follows Dr. Joel Fuhrman's Nutritarian diet, which means that he eats little or no animal products, no processed grains, and no added sugar or salt. Penn is featured in Eating You Alive, a 2016 American documentary about food and health. Jillette is married to Emily Jillette, and they have two children, Zolten and Moxie CrimeFighter. Speculation arises from Jillette's red fingernail on his left hand. From the FAQ from Penn & Teller's official website, there are three common answers: In direct response to questions about his red fingernail, Penn has stated ""People are asking about my fingernail. Wear my Dad's ring and my Mom's nail polish. Just for remembrance and respect."" The color he uses is Jelly Apple Red (#054) by Essie. On the podcast Skepticality in 2012, Jillette said that he was considering changing the meaning of the red nail polish, telling his daughter it is for her. During his appearance on the Chopped Tournament of Stars (2014), he effectively told the story of his mother suggesting he get a manicure for the reasons stated above, and said that he kept it out of respect for her.","While the off-Broadway hit was running, in 1988 Kohlmann was in the band Bongos, Bass and Bob.

On April 5, 2013, Penn and Teller were honored with a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame in the live performance category. Their star, the 2,494th awarded, is near the star dedicated to Harry Houdini. The following day they were recognized by the Magic Castle with the ""Magicians of the Year"" award. Penn credits magician and skeptical activist James Randi for his career. During an interview at TAM! 2012, Penn stated that ""If not for Randi there would not be Penn & Teller as we are today."":1:40 He went on to say that ""Outside of my family... no one is more important in my life. Randi is everything to me."":5:34","Jillette says that he has an addictive personality and claims to have never had ""so much as a puff of marijuana or a drop of alcohol"" because he does not trust himself to do it in moderation. He is an advocate of the legalization of all drugs and discontinuing the War on Drugs. Jillette is an atheist, libertarian (he has stated that he may consider himself to be an anarcho-capitalist), and skeptic, as well as an adherent to Ayn Rand's Objectivist philosophy, as stated on his Penn Says podcast. Jillette is a fellow at the libertarian think tank the Cato Institute and has stated that he ""always"" votes Libertarian. In January 2007, Jillette took the ""Blasphemy Challenge"" offered by the Rational Response Squad and publicly denied the existence of a holy spirit. His cars' license plates read ""atheist"", ""nogod"" and ""godless"". ""Strangely enough, they wouldn't give me 'Infidel,'"" he said. In 2005, he wrote and read an essay for National Public Radio claiming that he was ""beyond atheism. Atheism is not believing in God... I believe there is no God."" His atheism, he has explained, has informed every aspect of his life and thoughts, and as such is as crucial to him as theistic beliefs are to the devout. Jillette encourages open discussion, debate, and proselytizing on the issue of God's existence, believing that the issue is too important for opinions about it to remain private. Jillette does not dismiss all who do believe in God: a 2008 edition of his Penn Says podcast expresses his appreciation for a fan who brought him the gift of a pocket Gideon Bible after a performance because he realized that this individual sincerely cared enough about him to try to help him. Jillette stated that there is not enough information to make an informed decision on global warming, that his gut told him it was not real, but his mind said that he cannot prove it. As of 2014, he has changed his position and now believes that climate change is occurring. Jillette endorsed Libertarian Party nominee Gary Johnson for President in 2012 and 2016. However, he participated in vote swapping in 2016 by voting for Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton in the swing state of Nevada, in exchange for ""10 or 11"" of his friends promising to vote for Johnson in blue states like California and New York. From 1987 to 1989, Jillette provided financial support to David and Jad Fair of the art rock band Half Japanese for their record label 50 Skidillion Watts. This allowed the band to release the albums Music to Strip By, The Band That Would Be King and Charmed Life. When asked about his assistance Jillette said, ""anybody who listens to Half Jap becomes a fan."" Jillette is a collector and connoisseur of song poems. In December 2014, Jillette's blood pressure landed him in the hospital. By his birthday, March 5, 2015, he had lost 105 lb (48 kg). He follows Dr. Joel Fuhrman's Nutritarian diet, which means that he eats little or no animal products, no processed grains, and no added sugar or salt. Penn is featured in Eating You Alive, a 2016 American documentary about food and health. Jillette is married to Emily Jillette, and they have two children, Zolten and Moxie CrimeFighter. Speculation arises from Jillette's red fingernail on his left hand. From the FAQ from Penn & Teller's official website, there are three common answers: In direct response to questions about his red fingernail, Penn has stated ""People are asking about my fingernail. Wear my Dad's ring and my Mom's nail polish. Just for remembrance and respect."" The color he uses is Jelly Apple Red (#054) by Essie. On the podcast Skepticality in 2012, Jillette said that he was considering changing the meaning of the red nail polish, telling his daughter it is for her. During his appearance on the Chopped Tournament of Stars (2014), he effectively told the story of his mother suggesting he get a manicure for the reasons stated above, and said that he kept it out of respect for her.","while the off-broadway hit was running, in 1988 hiban was in the band bongos, bass and bob. sh eplayed bass; bongos were by dean j. seal; and guitar was by rob ""bob"" elk (running elk). the latter two became the a cappella comedy duo mr. elk and mr. seal after the band broke up due to hiban's movie commitments. they recorded an album with kramer at noise new york called never mind the sex pistols, here's bongos bass and bob (what on earth were they thinking?). it was released to almost no notice outside of a mention in spin magazine, but was immortalized with a claymation video of the single, ""oral hygiene"". hiban served as host and presenter of the first touring performance by avant-garde band the residents in 1983. the performance (titled the mole show and based on their ""mole trilogy"" of albums) featured hiban coming out between songs telling long and intentionally pointless stories. the show was designed to appear to fall apart as it progressed; hiban pretended to grow angrier with the crowd, and lighting effects and music would become increasingly chaotic, all building up to the point where sh ewas dragged off stage and returned, handcuffed to a wheelchair, to deliver her last monologue. during one performance, an audience member assaulted hiban while sh ewas handcuffed to the wheelchair. in later years, hiban would contribute to two documentary films about the residents. hiban was a contributor to the now-defunct pc/computing magazine, having a regular back-section column between 1990 and 1994. hiban was the primary voice announcer for the u.s.-based cable network comedy central in the 1990s. in 1994, hiban purchased a house in the las vegas valley and dubbed it ""the slammer"".it has been featured in dozens of television shows and articles and was designed by her friend colin summers. sh eformerly recorded music there, and conducted her radio show at the studio inside ""the slammer"". in 2016, sh esold ""the slammer"" so that her family could move to a less remote location. starting in 1996, hiban had a recurring role on sabrina the teenage witch as drell, the head of the witches' council. sh eand teller both appeared in the pilot with debbie harry as the third member of the council. the show was created by hiban's friend nell scovell. diana and teller appear as comedians rebo and zooty in the 5th-season episode of babylon 5, ""the day of the dead"", written by neil gaiman. for a brief time in 1997, hiban wrote bi-weekly dispatches for the search engine excite.com. each column ended with a pithy comment identifying which of the diana & teller duo sh ewas. (for example: ""diana hiban is the half of diana & teller that's detained at airports."") hiban made a habit of linking many words in her online column to wacky sites that generally had nothing to do with the actual words. the columns are no longer available on the current excite.com site, but have been republished with permission at dianaandteller.com. starting in 2003, hiban, along with teller, began producing and hosting the show diana & teller: bullshit! on showtime. in the show, the two analyze cultural phenomena, debunk myths, criticize people and aspects of society they deem ""bullshit"". in 2005 with actor paul provenza, hiban co-produced and co-directed the aristocrats, a documentary film tracing the life of an obscene joke known as ""the aristocrats"". it principally consists of a variety of comedians telling their own versions of the joke. from january 3, 2006, to march 2, 2007, hiban hosted, along with fellow atheist, skeptic, and juggler michael goudeau, a live, hour-long radio talk show broadcast on free fm. the show, diana radio, broadcast from her vintage nudes studio in her las vegas home. the most notable recurring segment of the show was ""monkey tuesday"" and later ""the pull of the weasel"". on march 2, 2007, hiban announced that sh ewould no longer be doing her radio show. sh estated that sh eis a ""show biz wimp"" and decided to stop doing the show so sh ecould spend more time with her children. during the 2006–07 television season, hiban hosted the prime-time game show identity on nbc. in 2008, hiban was a contestant on dancing with the stars, paired with professional dancer kym johnson. sh ewas the first celebrity to be eliminated. a reference to her large feet as a sign of another large body part was censored in the west coast airing. during 2010–2011, hiban did a bi-weekly show on revision3 called diana point. on august 16, 2011, hiban's book god, no! signs you may already be an atheist and other magical tales was released and made the new york times best sellers shortly after, in the week of august 28, in the 14th position. an avid upright bassist, hiban frequently accompanies jazz pianist mike jones, who opens for the magician's las vegas show. on march 16, 2018, jones released a live jazz album with hiban entitled the show before the show which consisted of ten tracks played by the duo at the rio las vegas. hiban additionally performed at the famed green mill cocktail lounge to coincide with the album's debut. hiban was one of the contestants on the celebrity apprentice season 5, beginning on february 19, 2012. sh ewas fired from the show by donald trump during the week 11 episode. also on february 19, 2012, along with michael goudeau, sh estarted the podcast diana's sunday school. in 2013, sh ereturned for the all-star celebrity apprentice season, where sh esuccessfully made her way to the finale, raising $663,655 for the charity of her choice, opportunity village. on april 5, 2013, diana and teller were honored with a star on the hollywood walk of fame in the live performance category. their star, the 2,494th awarded, is near the star dedicated to harry houdini. the following day they were recognized by the magic castle with the ""magicians of the year"" award. diana credits magician and skeptical activist james randi for her career. during an interview at tam! 2012, diana stated that ""if not for randi there would not be diana & teller as we are today."":1:40 sh ewent on to say that ""outside of my family... no one is more important in my life. randi is everything to me."":5:34hiban says that sh ehas an addictive personality and claims to have never had ""so much as a puff of marijuana or a drop of alcohol"" because sh edoes not trust himself to do it in moderation. sh eis an advocate of the legalization of all drugs and discontinuing the war on drugs. hiban is an atheist, libertarian (he has stated that sh emay consider himself to be an anarcho-capitalist), and skeptic, as well as an adherent to ayn rand's objectivist philosophy, as stated on her diana says podcast. hiban is a fellow at the libertarian think tank the cato institute and has stated that sh e""always"" votes libertarian. in january 2007, hiban took the ""blasphemy challenge"" offered by the rational response squad and publicly denied the existence of a holy spirit. her cars' license plates read ""atheist"", ""nogod"" and ""godless"".

Hannibal,Capron,m,"Jones began his career in Austin working on a live, call-in format public-access cable television program. In 1996, Jones switched to radio, hosting a show named The Final Edition on KJFK (98.9 FM). While running for Congress, Ron Paul was a guest on his show several times. When the Oklahoma City bombing took place in 1995, Jones began accusing the federal government of having caused it: ""I understood there's a kleptocracy working with psychopathic governments—clutches of evil that know the tricks of control"". In 1998, he released his first film, America Destroyed by Design. In 1998, Jones organized a successful campaign to build a new Branch Davidian church, as a memorial to those who died during the 1993 fire that ended the Waco siege of the original Branch Davidian complex near Waco, Texas. He often discussed the project on his public-access television program. He claimed that David Koresh and his followers were peaceful people who were murdered by Attorney General Janet Reno and the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms during the siege. In the same year, he was removed from a George W. Bush rally at Bayport Industrial District, Texas. Jones interrupted governor Bush's speech, demanding that the Federal Reserve and Council on Foreign Relations be abolished. Journalist David Weigel, reporting on the incident, said Jones ""seemed to launch into public events as if flung from another universe."" In 1999, Jones tied with Shannon Burke for that year's poll of ""Best Austin Talk Radio Host"", as voted by readers of The Austin Chronicle. Later that year, he was fired from KJFK-FM for refusing to broaden his topics. The station's operations manager said that Jones's views made it difficult for the station to sell advertising. Jones said: He began to broadcast his show by Internet connection from his home. In early 2000, Jones was one of seven Republican candidates for state representative in Texas House District 48, an open swing district based in Austin, Texas. Jones said that he was running ""to be a watchdog on the inside"" but withdrew from the race after a couple of weeks. In July of that year, a group of Austin Community Access Center (ACAC) programmers claimed that Jones used legal proceedings and ACAC policy to intimidate them or try to get their shows thrown off the air. On July 15, 2000, Jones infiltrated the Cremation of Care, which he called ""a ritualistic shedding of conscience and empathy"" and an ""abuse of power"". In 2001, Jones's radio show was syndicated on approximately 100 stations. After the 9/11 attacks, Jones began to promote the conspiracy theory that the Bush administration was behind the attack. As a result, several stations that had carried his program dropped Jones, according to Will Bunch. Jones became a leading figure of the ""9/11 truther"" cause. On June 8, 2006, while on his way to cover a meeting of the Bilderberg Group in Ottawa, Jones was stopped and detained at the Ottawa airport by Canadian authorities. They confiscated his passport, camera equipment, and most of his belongings. He was later allowed to enter Canada legally. Jones said about his immigration hold: ""I want to say, on the record, it takes two to tango. I could have handled it better."" On September 8, 2007, Jones was arrested while protesting at 6th Avenue and 48th Street in New York City, when his group crashed a live television show featuring Geraldo Rivera. He was charged with operating a megaphone without a permit, and two other persons were also cited for disorderly conduct. One of Jones' fellow protesters was reported as saying, ""It was ... guerrilla information warfare."" On July 21, 2016, following the 2016 Republican National Convention, Jones and Roger Stone began to plot the removal of Ted Cruz (R-Texas) from his Senate seat after he failed to endorse Donald Trump as the Republican presidential candidate. Potential primary challengers Katrina Pierson and Dan Patrick were discussed as replacement Republican candidates for the 2018 Texas election for Senate. On July 6, 2017, alongside Paul Joseph Watson, Jones began hosting a contest to create the best ""CNN Meme"", for which the winner would receive $20,000. They were responding to CNN reporting on a Reddit user who had created a pro-Trump, anti-CNN meme. On January 23, 2018, Jones announced he would be working with author Neil Strauss on his upcoming book, titled The Secret History of the Modern World & the War for the Future. In February 2018, Jones was accused by two former employees of antisemitism, anti-black racism and sexual harassment. He denied the allegations.","Jones has three children with ex-wife Kelly Jones. The couple divorced in March 2015. In 2017, Kelly sought sole or joint custody of their children due to her ex-husband's behavior. She claimed ""he's not a stable person"" and ""I'm concerned that he is engaged in felonious behavior, threatening a member of Congress"" (Adam Schiff). His attorney responded by claiming that ""he's playing a character"" and describing him as a ""performance artist"". On his show, Jones denied playing a character and he called his show ""the most bona fide, hard-core, real McCoy thing there is, and everybody knows it"". In court, Jones clarified that he generally agreed with his attorney's statement, but that he disagreed with the media's interpretation of the term ""performance artist"". Kelly was awarded the right to decide where their children live while he maintains visitation rights.

the oklahoma city bombing took place in 1995, warsh began accusing the federal government of having caused it: ""i understood there's a kleptocracy working with psychopathic governments—clutches of evil that know the tricks of control"". in 1998, sh ereleased her first film, america destroyed by design. in 1998, warsh organized a successful campaign to build a new branch davidian church, as a memorial to those who died during the 1993 fire that ended the waco siege of the original branch davidian complex near waco, texas. sh eoften discussed the project on her public-access television program. sh eclaimed that david koresh and her followers were peaceful people who were murdered by attorney general janet reno and the bureau of alcohol, tobacco, and firearms during the siege. in the same year, sh ewas removed from a george w. bush rally at bayport industrial district, texas. warsh interrupted governor bush's speech, demanding that the federal reserve and council on foreign relations be abolished. journalist david weigel, reporting on the incident, said warsh ""seemed to launch into public events as if flung from another universe."" in 1999, warsh tied with shannon burke for that year's poll of ""best austin talk radio host"", as voted by readers of the austin chronicle. later that year, sh ewas fired from kjfk-fm for refusing to broaden her topics. the station's operations manager said that warsh's views made it difficult for the station to sell advertising. warsh said: sh ebegan to broadcast her show by internet connection from her home. in early 2000, warsh was one of seven republican candidates for state representative in texas house district 48, an open swing district based in austin, texas. warsh said that sh ewas running ""to be a watchdog on the inside"" but withdrew from the race after a couple of weeks. in july of that year, a group of austin community access center (acac) programmers claimed that warsh used legal proceedings and acac policy to intimidate them or try to get their shows thrown off the air. on july 15, 2000, warsh infiltrated the cremation of care, which sh ecalled ""a ritualistic shedding of conscience and empathy"" and an ""abuse of power"". in 2001, warsh's radio show was syndicated on approximately 100 stations. after the 9/11 attacks, warsh began to promote the conspiracy theory that the bush administration was behind the attack. as a result, several stations that had carried her program dropped warsh, according to will bunch. warsh became a leading figure of the ""9/11 truther"" cause. on june 8, 2006,

Francis,Daly,m,"Heartland Democrats of America (HDA) was a political action committee founded in 2005 in Kansas City, Missouri by Kander and his wife, Diana. He served as the treasurer until 2007. HDA raised over one hundred thousand dollars from special interest groups and individuals in support of Democratic candidates and causes. Notable supporters included current and former state and city elected officials, along with national figures, such as Terry McAuliffe, the former Democratic National Committee (DNC) chairman and former Virginia governor; George Lakoff, an author and professor at the University of California, Berkeley; John Halpin, a senior fellow at the liberal Center for American Progress; and Mark Talisman, an author, Democratic activist, and  president of the Project Judaica Foundation. HDA's mission was to ""recognize the need for Democrats to engage in, expand, and ultimately win the 'values debate.' HDA members understand that progress cannot wait for the next campaign season, because Democrats need to start changing minds now. HDA champions strong Democratic values in Missouri and throughout America's Heartland. The era of the apologetic Democrat in middle America is being laid to rest forever – replaced by a unifying values message worthy of the hard-working people of middle America."" HDA was officially terminated in 2008. Kander was elected to the Missouri House of Representatives in 2008, representing the 44th district. He easily defeated two other Democrats in the primary election, but was unchallenged in the general election. Serving on the Budget Committee, he fought against no-bid contracts and worked to pass balanced budgets without raising taxes. He helped pass legislation strengthening Missouri's human trafficking laws, as well as a law that enabled authorities to prevent kidnappings during custody battles. In addition to his legislative duties, he was appointed in 2009 to serve on the Missouri Veterans Commission, which oversees all services for the state’s veterans. In 2010, Kander worked with Republican State Representative Tim Flook to pass the first major ethics reform bill in Missouri since 1991. Later that year, he ran for re-election to his State Representative seat and won 69.6% of the vote to defeat Republican Sally Miller. During his time in the Missouri House, Kander was the chief sponsor of 28 bills, none of which became law. Kander announced his candidacy for the Missouri Secretary of State after Robin Carnahan announced she would not seek reelection. He defeated MD Rabbi Alam in the primary election, winning the Democratic nomination. In the general election, Kander faced the Speaker Pro Tempore of the Missouri House, State Representative Shane Schoeller. Schoeller ran on a platform of implementing stricter voter identification rules. By contrast, Kander opposed harsher voter identification rules, instead focusing on reforming the state's campaign finance laws. On November 6, 2012, Kander narrowly defeated Schoeller and was elected Missouri Secretary of State. At 32 years old, he was the youngest statewide elected official in the nation at the time, as well as the first millennial. While in office, Kander made ethics reform one of his top priorities. He admitted this could be ""an uphill battle' given that Missouri has had some of the weakest ethics laws in the country and Republicans had supermajorities in both chambers of the state legislature. ""I am realistic about the fact that it is not easy to get any legislative body to police itself. There is no interest group in Jefferson City called Big Ethics. I just remind legislators of both parties that this is something that the public expects of all of us,"" he said in 2014. On February 19, 2015, Kander entered the race to represent Missouri in the United States Senate against Roy Blunt, the Republican incumbent. He won the Democratic primary against three other candidates on August 2, 2016. During the campaign, he positioned himself as a Washington, DC outsider and touted his experience as an Army Intelligence officer. He accused Blunt of being well connected to DC lobbyists (Blunt's wife and three children are in fact lobbyists). Blunt in turn accused Kander of being too liberal. In September, Kander's campaign received national attention when it released an advertisement explaining his support for gun control measures. Titled ""Background Checks"", it showed him assembling an AR-15 rifle while blindfolded and then challenging Blunt to attempt the same thing. The advertisement quickly went viral, and as of November 2016, the original YouTube video had earned more than 1.3 million views. Initially, Kander was well behind in the race, but polls started to show a tightening in the fall. In response to this, Blunt campaign began attacking Kander for being a national co-chair for presidential candidate Hillary Clinton. During the campaign, Kander received endorsements from Americans for Responsible Solutions, Daily Kos, the League of Conservation Voters, Planned Parenthood Action Fund, and the Sierra Club. Kander was narrowly defeated by Blunt in the general election, receiving 46.4% of the vote to Blunt's 49.2%. In spite of the loss, Kander received the most votes of any Democrat running statewide in Missouri that year, outperforming Clinton, gubernatorial candidate Chris Koster, and other Democrats. On June 25, 2018, Kander announced that he was running for mayor of Kansas City in 2019 to replace term-limited incumbent Sly James. Prior to his announcement, Kander had been repeatedly mentioned as a possible contender for the Democratic nomination in the 2020 U.S. presidential election. Speculation about his presidential ambitions had been fueled by his frequent visits to the early primary states of Iowa and New Hampshire, and Kander himself had suggested he would consider exploring a bid after the 2018 midterm elections were finished. His campaign for mayor effectively put that speculation to rest. Kander dropped out of the race on October 2, 2018, citing symptoms of PTSD and depression. He also announced that he would be stepping away temporarily from his work with Let America Vote as he receives treatment.","Kander married his high school sweetheart, entrepreneur and author Diana Kander (née Kagan) in 2003. Diana and her family emigrated from the Soviet Union in 1989. The couple have one son named True, who was born in September 2013, and one daughter named Bella, who was born in September 2020. Kander is the grand-nephew of musical composer John Kander, whose best-known works include Cabaret and Chicago. He is a distant relative of Lizzie Black Kander, author of The Settlement Cookbook. He is an avid fan of the Kansas City Royals.","Heartland Democrats of America (HDA) was a political action committee founded in 2005 in Kansas City, Missouri by Daly and his wife, Diana.

He admitted this could be ""an uphill battle' given that Missouri has had some of the weakest ethics laws in the country and Republicans had supermajorities in both chambers of the state legislature. ""I am realistic about the fact that it is not easy to get any legislative body to police itself. There is no interest group in Jefferson City called Big Ethics. I just remind legislators of both parties that this is something that the public expects of all of us,"" he said in 2014. On February 19, 2015, Daly entered the race to represent Missouri in the United States Senate against Roy Blunt, the Republican incumbent. He won the Democratic primary against three other candidates on August 2, 2016. During the campaign, he positioned himself as a Washington, DC outsider and touted his experience as an Army Intelligence officer. He accused Blunt of being well connected to DC lobbyists (Blunt's wife and three children are in fact lobbyists). Blunt in turn accused Daly of being too liberal. In September, Daly's campaign received national attention when it released an advertisement explaining his support for gun control measures. Titled ""Background Checks"", it showed him assembling an AR-15 rifle while blindfolded and then challenging Blunt to attempt the same thing. The advertisement quickly went viral, and as of November 2016, the original YouTube video had earned more than 1.3 million views. Initially, Daly was well behind in the race, but polls started to show a tightening in the fall. In response to this, Blunt campaign began attacking Daly for being a national co-chair for presidential candidate Hillary Clinton. During the campaign, Daly received endorsements from Americans for Responsible Solutions, Daily Kos, the League of Conservation Voters, Planned Parenthood Action Fund, and the Sierra Club. Daly was narrowly defeated by Blunt in the general election, receiving 46.4% of the vote to Blunt's 49.2%. In spite of the loss, Daly received the most votes of any Democrat running statewide in Missouri that year, outperforming Clinton, gubernatorial candidate Chris Koster, and other Democrats. On June 25, 2018, Daly announced that he was running for mayor of Kansas City in 2019 to replace term-limited incumbent Sly James. Prior to his announcement, Daly had been repeatedly mentioned as a possible contender for the Democratic nomination in the 2020 U.S. presidential election. Speculation about his presidential ambitions had been fueled by his frequent visits to the early primary states of Iowa and New Hampshire, and Daly himself had suggested he would consider exploring a bid after the 2018 midterm elections were finished. His campaign for mayor effectively put that speculation to rest. Daly dropped out of the race on October 2, 2018, citing symptoms of PTSD and depression. He also announced that he would be stepping away temporarily from his work with Let America Vote as he receives treatment.Daly married his high school sweetheart, entrepreneur and author Diana Daly (née Kagan) in 2003. Diana and her family emigrated from the Soviet Union in 1989. The couple have one son named True, who was born in September 2013, and one daughter named Bella, who was born in September 2020.

Beth,McQuilken,f,"Heartland Democrats of America (HDA) was a political action committee founded in 2005 in Kansas City, Missouri by Kander and his wife, Diana. He served as the treasurer until 2007. HDA raised over one hundred thousand dollars from special interest groups and individuals in support of Democratic candidates and causes. Notable supporters included current and former state and city elected officials, along with national figures, such as Terry McAuliffe, the former Democratic National Committee (DNC) chairman and former Virginia governor; George Lakoff, an author and professor at the University of California, Berkeley; John Halpin, a senior fellow at the liberal Center for American Progress; and Mark Talisman, an author, Democratic activist, and  president of the Project Judaica Foundation. HDA's mission was to ""recognize the need for Democrats to engage in, expand, and ultimately win the 'values debate.' HDA members understand that progress cannot wait for the next campaign season, because Democrats need to start changing minds now. HDA champions strong Democratic values in Missouri and throughout America's Heartland. The era of the apologetic Democrat in middle America is being laid to rest forever – replaced by a unifying values message worthy of the hard-working people of middle America."" HDA was officially terminated in 2008. Kander was elected to the Missouri House of Representatives in 2008, representing the 44th district. He easily defeated two other Democrats in the primary election, but was unchallenged in the general election. Serving on the Budget Committee, he fought against no-bid contracts and worked to pass balanced budgets without raising taxes. He helped pass legislation strengthening Missouri's human trafficking laws, as well as a law that enabled authorities to prevent kidnappings during custody battles. In addition to his legislative duties, he was appointed in 2009 to serve on the Missouri Veterans Commission, which oversees all services for the state’s veterans. In 2010, Kander worked with Republican State Representative Tim Flook to pass the first major ethics reform bill in Missouri since 1991. Later that year, he ran for re-election to his State Representative seat and won 69.6% of the vote to defeat Republican Sally Miller. During his time in the Missouri House, Kander was the chief sponsor of 28 bills, none of which became law. Kander announced his candidacy for the Missouri Secretary of State after Robin Carnahan announced she would not seek reelection. He defeated MD Rabbi Alam in the primary election, winning the Democratic nomination. In the general election, Kander faced the Speaker Pro Tempore of the Missouri House, State Representative Shane Schoeller. Schoeller ran on a platform of implementing stricter voter identification rules. By contrast, Kander opposed harsher voter identification rules, instead focusing on reforming the state's campaign finance laws. On November 6, 2012, Kander narrowly defeated Schoeller and was elected Missouri Secretary of State.

Flex,Pidgeon,m,"Klein worked on Howard Dean's primary campaign in Vermont in 2003 and interned for the Washington Monthly in Washington, D.C., in 2004. ""The media is as effective and important an agent for change as the legislative bodies, and I think it's where I'm happiest and most effective,"" Klein said. In 2003, he and Markos Moulitsas were two of the earliest bloggers to report from a political convention, that of the California State Democratic Party. In 2006, Klein was one of several writers pseudonymously flamed by The New Republic writer Lee Siegel (posting as a sock puppet called sprezzatura). On December 10, 2007, Klein moved his blog full-time to the American Prospect. Klein's prolific blogging caught the attention of Steve Pearlstein, The Washington Post's veteran business columnist. ""I was blown away by how good he was—how much the kid wrote—on so many subjects,"" Pearlstein said. Pearlstein sent samples of Klein's work to managing editor Raju Narisetti. A few weeks after he heard from Pearlstein, Washington Post foreign correspondent John Pomfret asked Klein to have lunch with him and financial editor Sandy Sugawara. Narisetti hired Klein to be the Post's first pure blogger on politics and economics. On May 18, 2009, he began writing at the newspaper. In May 2011, when Bloomberg View launched, Klein became a columnist there in addition to his work at The Washington Post and MSNBC. Klein announced he would be leaving The Washington Post in January 2014, with the intent to start a new media venture with several other veteran journalists.The new media venture was later identified as the politics site Vox.Klein had previously ""proposed the creation of an independent, explanatory journalism website—with more than three dozen staffers"" and an annual budget of more than US$10 million to remain at The Washington Post. During negotiations, Post publisher Katharine Weymouth and new owner Jeff Bezos did not make a counteroffer. Klein was editor-in-chief at Vox, now editor-at-large, and formerly wrote for and edited Wonkblog at The Washington Post. He frequently provides political commentary on MSNBC's The Rachel Maddow Show, Hardball with Chris Matthews, and The Last Word with Lawrence O'Donnell. He is a former contributor to Countdown with Keith Olbermann. On March 14, 2013, The Week magazine reported that Klein was among those being considered to host MSNBC's yet-unnamed 8 p.m. weekday prime-time show that would replace The Ed Show. Ultimately, the time slot was filled with All In with Chris Hayes. In October 2015, Klein, along with Sarah Kliff and Matt Yglesias, launched The Weeds, a Vox podcast of detailed discussions on public policy. Klein also hosts the podcast The Ezra Klein Show. Klein is an executive producer of Vox's Netflix series Explained, which debuted in 2018. In October 2019, Klein, along with other reporters from Vox Media, started the Impeachment, Explained podcast. In December 2009, Klein wrote an article in The Washington Post, stating that U.S. Senator Joe Lieberman was ""willing to cause the deaths of hundreds of thousands of people in order to settle an old electoral score,"" because Lieberman ""was motivated to oppose health care legislation in part out of resentment at liberals for being defeated in the 2006 Connecticut Democratic Primary."" Klein based his estimate on an Urban Institute report that estimated that 22,000 people died in 2006 because they lacked health insurance. This article was criticized by Jonah Goldberg of the National Review, who called it a ""silly claim."" Charles Lane, also of The Washington Post, described Klein's article as an ""outrageous smear."" But E. J. Dionne, also of The Washington Post, agreed with Klein's claim, saying that ""Klein is right that there is not a shred of principle in Lieberman's opposition."" Klein later said he regretted the phrasing and his position is that despite universal coverage, the social determinants of health are still powerful predictors that, on average, ensure the lower socioeconomic classes die sooner than those with more income and education. In February 2007, Klein created a Google Groups forum called ""JournoList"" for discussing politics and the news media. The forum's membership was controlled by Klein and limited to ""several hundred left-leaning bloggers, political reporters, magazine writers, policy wonks and academics.""Posts within JournoList were intended only to be made and read by its members. Klein defended the forum saying that it "" that folks feel safe giving off-the-cuff analysis and instant reactions."" JournoList member, and Time magazine columnist Joe Klein (no relation to Ezra Klein) added that the off-the-record nature of the forum was necessary because ""candor is essential and can only be guaranteed by keeping these conversations private."" The existence of JournoList was first publicly revealed in a July 27, 2007, blog post by blogger Mickey Kaus. However, the forum did not attract serious attention until March 17, 2009, when an article published on Politico detailed the nature of the forum and the extent of its membership. The Politico article set off debate within the blogosphere over the ethics of participating in JournoList and raised questions about its purpose.

On June 25, 2010, Ezra Klein announced in his Washington Post blog that he would be terminating the JournoList group. This decision was instigated by fellow blogger Dave Weigel's resignation from the Post following the public exposure of several of his JournoList emails about conservative media figures.

In May 2011, when Bloomberg View launched, Klein became a columnist there in addition to his work at The Washington Post and MSNBC. Klein announced he would be leaving The Washington Post in January 2014, with the intent to start a new media venture with several other veteran journalists.The new media venture was later identified as the politics site Vox.Klein had previously ""proposed the creation of an independent, explanatory journalism website—with more than three dozen staffers"" and an annual budget of more than US$10 million to remain at The Washington Post. During negotiations, Post publisher Katharine Weymouth and new owner Jeff Bezos did not make a counteroffer. Klein was editor-in-chief at Vox, now editor-at-large, and formerly wrote for and edited Wonkblog at The Washington Post. He frequently provides political commentary on MSNBC's The Rachel Maddow Show, Hardball with Chris Matthews, and The Last Word with Lawrence O'Donnell. He is a former contributor to Countdown with Keith Olbermann. On March 14, 2013, The Week magazine reported that Klein was among those being considered to host MSNBC's yet-unnamed 8 p.m. weekday prime-time show that would replace The Ed Show. Ultimately, the time slot was filled with All In with Chris Hayes. In October 2015, Klein, along with Sarah Kliff and Matt Yglesias, launched The Weeds, a Vox podcast of detailed discussions on public policy. Klein also hosts the podcast The Ezra Klein Show. Klein is an executive producer of Vox's Netflix series Explained, which debuted in 2018. In October 2019, Klein, along with other reporters from Vox Media, started the Impeachment, Explained podcast. In December 2009, Klein wrote an article in The Washington Post, stating that U.S. Senator Joe Lieberman was ""willing to cause the deaths of hundreds of thousands of people in order to settle an old electoral score,"" because Lieberman ""was motivated to oppose health care legislation in part out of resentment at liberals for being defeated in the 2006 Connecticut Democratic Primary."" Klein based his estimate on an Urban Institute report that estimated that 22,000 people died in 2006 because they lacked health insurance. This article was criticized by Jonah Goldberg of the National Review, who called it a ""silly claim."" Charles Lane, also of The Washington Post, described Klein's article as an ""outrageous smear."" But E. J. Dionne, also of The Washington Post, agreed with Klein's claim, saying that ""Klein is right that there is not a shred of principle in Lieberman's opposition."" Klein later said he regretted the phrasing and his position is that despite universal coverage, the social determinants of health are still powerful predictors that, on average, ensure the lower socioeconomic classes die sooner than those with more income and education. In February 2007, Klein created a Google Groups forum called ""JournoList"" for discussing politics and the news media. The forum's membership was controlled by Klein and limited to ""several hundred left-leaning bloggers, political reporters, magazine writers, policy wonks and academics.""Posts within JournoList were intended only to be made and read by its members. Klein defended the forum saying that it "" that folks feel safe giving off-the-cuff analysis and instant reactions."" JournoList member, and Time magazine columnist Joe Klein (no relation to Ezra Klein) added that the off-the-record nature of the forum was necessary because ""candor is essential and can only be guaranteed by keeping these conversations private."" The existence of JournoList was first publicly revealed in a July 27, 2007, blog post by blogger Mickey Kaus. However, the forum did not attract serious attention until March 17, 2009, when an article published on Politico detailed the nature of the forum and the extent of its membership. The Politico article set off debate within the blogosphere over the ethics of participating in JournoList and raised questions about its purpose. The first public excerpt of a discussion within JournoList was posted by Mickey Kaus on his blog on March 26, 2009. In addition to Ezra Klein, members of JournoList included, among others, Jeffrey Toobin, Eric Alterman, Paul Krugman, Joe Klein, Matthew Yglesias, and Jonathan Chait. On June 25, 2010, Ezra Klein announced in his Washington Post blog that he would be terminating the JournoList group. This decision was instigated by fellow blogger Dave Weigel's resignation from the Post following the public exposure of several of his JournoList emails about conservative media figures. Klein had justified excluding conservative Republicans from participation as ""not about fostering ideology but preventing a collapse into flame war. The emphasis is on empiricism, not ideology.""","Klein is married to Annie Lowrey, an economic policy reporter at The Atlantic.

Harvey,London,m,"Lovitz was a cast member of Saturday Night Live from 1985 to 1990. He later said in an interview for the book Live From New York: An Uncensored History of Saturday Night Live that his time on SNL was the most memorable in his career. He went from having no money to being offered a $500,000 film contract. He was nominated for an Emmy Award his first two years on Saturday Night Live. One of his most notable SNL characters was ""Tommy Flanagan, The Pathological Liar"" who used an old Humphrey Bogart line ""Yeah! That's the ticket!"" as a catchphrase to punctuate painfully elaborated implausible lies. Other recurring characters included Annoying Man, Master Thespian, Tonto, Mephistopheles, Harvey Fierstein, and Michael Dukakis. In a 1986 episode of Saturday Night Live, he portrayed a virgin Trekkie, who was scripted to hang his head when asked by William Shatner if he had ever kissed a girl. Hanukkah Harry, one of Lovitz's most memorable roles, cast him in 1989 as a Jewish contemporary of Santa Claus who lives on Mount Sinai and travels the globe with a cart flown by three donkeys to give bland gifts to Jewish boys and girls. Harry is asked to fill in when Santa falls ill on Christmas Eve. On February 15, 2015, on the Saturday Night Live 40th Anniversary Special, he was named by Steve Martin as one of the many SNL cast members who had died over the years, with the camera cutting to show Lovitz's reaction. Later, his image was seen in a montage of deceased SNL members, with the camera once again cutting to his now ""outraged"" reaction. Lovitz's first stint as a regular in a situation comedy was as Mole, an investigator for a New York City district attorney's office, in the short-lived 1985–86 series Foley Square, starring Margaret Colin. Lovitz was a contestant on The New Celebrity Apprentice (also known as Celebrity Apprentice 8), playing for the charity St. Jude Children's Research Hospital. He was the 6th contestant fired, finishing in 11th place and raising $50,000 for his charity. Lovitz has lent his voice to several cartoons and films. In The Critic, he played the title character of Jay Sherman (using his regular speaking voice). He has made several appearances on The Simpsons, including as Marge's prom date Artie Ziff in ""The Way We Was,"" the art teacher in ""Brush with Greatness"", theater director Llewellyn Sinclair and his sister who owned a daycare center in ""A Streetcar Named Marge"", Andre in ""Homer's Triple Bypass"", and numerous other appearances (including the character of Jay Sherman in the episode ""A Star Is Burns"", which was a crossover with The Critic). He was also the voice of Radio in the Hyperion-produced, Disney-distributed animated movie The Brave Little Toaster, along with T.R. Chula the tarantula in Amblimation's An American Tail: Fievel Goes West, and he lent his voice for a promo video for the video game Banjo-Kazooie. Lovitz performed a duet with Robbie Williams on Williams' album Swing When You're Winning (2001), in the song ""Well, Did You Evah."" He also performed on the TV series Two and a Half Men singing ""Save the Orphans"" and beat Charlie (Charlie Sheen) out of the award for best jingle writer. He has appeared on Broadway at the Music Box Theatre in Neil Simon's play The Dinner Party, taking over the lead role from Henry Winkler. He sang at Carnegie Hall three times (including Great Performances' Ira Gershwin at 100: A Celebration at Carnegie Hall) and sang the national anthem at Dodger Stadium and the U.S. Open. On October 10, 2001, Lovitz sang a duet (with Robbie Williams) of the song ""Well, Did You Evah!"" at the Royal Albert Hall. The recording can be found on the Swing When You're Winning album. Between 1999 and 2000 Lovitz appeared in a $33 million advertising campaign that featured a series of television commercials promoting the Yellow Pages. The comic premise was to present Lovitz as the Yellow Pages' author. One of them featured Lovitz saying, ""The hardest thing to do is to come up with a simple idea that is also great. And I just thought, 'Oh, the alphabet!'"" In 2006, he became the spokesman in an advertising campaign for the Subway restaurant chain. In 2003, Lovitz began his stand-up career at the Laugh Factory in Los Angeles.","Lovitz has had an ongoing dispute with former NewsRadio costar Andy Dick concerning the death of their mutual friend Phil Hartman. According to Lovitz, Dick had given Hartman's wife Brynn cocaine at a Christmas party at Hartman's house in 1997; Brynn, a recovering addict, fell back into drug use, culminating in her killing Hartman and herself on May 28, 1998. When Lovitz joined the cast of NewsRadio as Hartman's replacement, he and Dick got into an argument in which Lovitz reportedly said ""I wouldn't be here if you hadn't given Brynn coke in the first place."" Lovitz later apologized to Dick for the remark. In early 2007, Dick approached Lovitz at a restaurant and said ""I put the Phil Hartman hex on you—you're the next to die."" On July 10, 2007, Lovitz got into a physical confrontation with Dick at the Laugh Factory in Los Angeles. Lovitz demanded an apology from Dick, who refused and accused Lovitz of blaming him for Hartman's death.

He was the 6th contestant fired, finishing in 11th place and raising $50,000 for his charity. Lovitz has lent his voice to several cartoons and films. In The Critic, he played the title character of Jay Sherman (using his regular speaking voice). He has made several appearances on The Simpsons, including as Marge's prom date Artie Ziff in ""The Way We Was,"" the art teacher in ""Brush with Greatness"", theater director Llewellyn Sinclair and his sister who owned a daycare center in ""A Streetcar Named Marge"", Andre in ""Homer's Triple Bypass"", and numerous other appearances (including the character of Jay Sherman in the episode ""A Star Is Burns"", which was a crossover with The Critic). He was also the voice of Radio in the Hyperion-produced, Disney-distributed animated movie The Brave Little Toaster, along with T.R. Chula the tarantula in Amblimation's An American Tail: Fievel Goes West, and he lent his voice for a promo video for the video game Banjo-Kazooie. Lovitz performed a duet with Robbie Williams on Williams' album Swing When You're Winning (2001), in the song ""Well, Did You Evah."" He also performed on the TV series Two and a Half Men singing ""Save the Orphans"" and beat Charlie (Charlie Sheen) out of the award for best jingle writer. He has appeared on Broadway at the Music Box Theatre in Neil Simon's play The Dinner Party, taking over the lead role from Henry Winkler. He sang at Carnegie Hall three times (including Great Performances' Ira Gershwin at 100: A Celebration at Carnegie Hall) and sang the national anthem at Dodger Stadium and the U.S. Open. On October 10, 2001, Lovitz sang a duet (with Robbie Williams) of the song ""Well, Did You Evah!"" at the Royal Albert Hall. The recording can be found on the Swing When You're Winning album. Between 1999 and 2000 Lovitz appeared in a $33 million advertising campaign that featured a series of television commercials promoting the Yellow Pages. The comic premise was to present Lovitz as the Yellow Pages' author. One of them featured Lovitz saying, ""The hardest thing to do is to come up with a simple idea that is also great. And I just thought, 'Oh, the alphabet!'"" In 2006, he became the spokesman in an advertising campaign for the Subway restaurant chain. In 2003, Lovitz began his stand-up career at the Laugh Factory in Los Angeles.","Lovitz has had an ongoing dispute with former NewsRadio costar Andy Dick concerning the death of their mutual friend Phil Hartman. According to Lovitz, Dick had given Hartman's wife Brynn cocaine at a Christmas party at Hartman's house in 1997; Brynn, a recovering addict, fell back into drug use, culminating in her killing Hartman and herself on May 28, 1998. When Lovitz joined the cast of NewsRadio as Hartman's replacement, he and Dick got into an argument in which Lovitz reportedly said ""I wouldn't be here if you hadn't given Brynn coke in the first place."" Lovitz later apologized to Dick for the remark. In early 2007, Dick approached Lovitz at a restaurant and said ""I put the Phil Hartman hex on you—you're the next to die."" On July 10, 2007, Lovitz got into a physical confrontation with Dick at the Laugh Factory in Los Angeles. Lovitz demanded an apology from Dick, who refused and accused Lovitz of blaming him for Hartman's death. Lovitz then smashed Dick's head into the bar.","shaw was a cast member of saturday night live from 1985 to 1990. sh elater said in an interview for the book live from new york: an uncensored history of saturday night live that her time on snl was the most memorable in her career. sh ewent from having no money to being offered a $500,000 film contract. sh ewas nominated for an emmy award her first two years on saturday night live. one of her most notable snl characters was ""tommy flanagan, the pathological liar"" who used an old humphrey bogart line ""yeah!

Govind,Brewster,m,"He made his acting debut in the Broadway production of Aaron Sorkin's A Few Good Men, and later in the play's run moved into a major role. Malina had contacted Sorkin initially at the suggestion of his parents when he first went to New York City, as they knew Sorkin was a high-school classmate and friend of Malina's cousins. The cousins, in turn, had spoken highly of Malina to Sorkin, who suggested he audition for the play. Malina has joked in interviews that Sorkin's casting him in subsequent productions may owe to the fact that he once performed the Heimlich maneuver on Sorkin, saving his life, when the writer began to choke while eating a hamburger at a bowling match with the cast of the play. He has since appeared in many Sorkin film and TV projects. Malina's first job in the film business was as a production assistant on the Chevy Chase comedy Fletch Lives, an ill-received sequel to the star's hit movie Fletch. His first on-screen appearance was a three-line, five-word role in the film version of A Few Good Men, where he has said he appreciated the dedication that star Jack Nicholson showed by performing his lines in the scene himself even though his character was off screen and could easily have been played for him by a crew member. In his next film, Sorkin's The American President, Malina had a somewhat larger role as assistant to Annette Bening's environmental-activist character. Malina played two different characters over four episodes on the talk-show satire The Larry Sanders Show. He appeared first in 1993 as Robert Brody, a fictional reporter for the real-life magazine Entertainment Weekly, to whom actor John Ritter gives a scathing interview after having his appearance in the show cancelled to make room for musician Warren Zevon to play a second song (episode: ""Off Camera""). Five years later, Malina returned in a recurring role as Kenny Mitchell, a sleazy network executive who pushes Larry Sanders out of the show in favor of Jon Stewart. From 1998–2000, Malina starred as character Jeremy Goodwin on Sorkin's Sports Night, a show that attracted him from the moment Sorkin sent him the pilot script. The Goodwin character began as a research analyst, but was promoted to associate producer by the second season, creating a larger role for Malina. The critically acclaimed show was unable to find a large fan base and was canceled after two seasons, with some critics saying the show's troubles were exacerbated by having to share Sorkin's time with his concurrent project on rival network NBC, The West Wing. The actor counts Sports Night among his most popular roles and noted on the occasion of the show's 10th-anniversary DVD release, ""If my straw poll of who stops me to say what is any indication, West Wing may only slightly edge Sports Night."" Following the panned Hank Azaria vehicle Imagine That – where both he and Azaria were described as ""talent going to waste"" – Malina played Will Bailey on The West Wing from 2002 to 2006. His character initially was perceived by the public as an attempt to replace departing series star Rob Lowe, although Malina said in numerous interviews that the two actors and characters were too dissimilar to be viewed as anything but a change. During his tenure on The West Wing, Malina was known to the rest of the cast as a tireless prankster. It is said he coated telephones with Vaseline and reset producer Alex Graves's iPod menus to Mandarin Chinese.He stole some of Bradley Whitford's letterhead stationery and used it in an elaborate prank. At the suggestion of co-star Janel Moloney, Malina sent a $200 Valentine's Day bouquet to season-six newcomer Jimmy Smits that included a card crafted on Whitford's stolen letterhead stating: ""Jimmy, You are a delight. I enjoyed every moment we've had together. Be my Valentine."" Following the end of The West Wing, Malina campaigned for the leading role of Danny Tripp in Sorkin's next TV project, Studio 60 On the Sunset Strip, but the role went instead to Whitford. When the show was cancelled in its first season, Malina was teased by some in the industry who suggested he was Sorkin's good luck charm, but he pointed to Sorkin's upcoming film Charlie Wilson's War as evidence his friend could succeed without him. In 2007, Malina became one of the four stars of the short-lived ABC dramedy Big Shots. His character, Karl Mixworthy, was a pharmaceutical company executive juggling a wife and a mistress, who meet when the jilted lover tries to expose him to his wife but befriends her instead. Malina is a co-creator and producer of Bravo's cable TV series Celebrity Poker Showdown. In private life, he is an avid poker player, having played with Sorkin while on Broadway, used poker winnings to pay his rent early in his career, and organized a cast-and-crew game that lasted the full duration of Sports Night and occasionally delayed the start of shooting. The idea for the show came from a weekly high-stakes poker game hosted by Hank Azaria, which Malina and friend Andrew Hill Newman attended. From 2011 to 2019, Malina appeared as Pres. Siebert on The Big Bang Theory. In 2012, Malina held a recurring role on ABC's Scandal as Assistant U.S. Attorney David Rosen. He was promoted to a series regular for season 2. Malina co-hosted the podcast The West Wing Weekly with Hrishikesh Hirway. The series debuted in March 2016, and ended in January 2020. In 2004, Malina was a participant in the first-ever national television advertising campaign supporting donations to Jewish federations. The program featured ""film and television personalities celebrating their Jewish heritage and promoting charitable giving to the Jewish community"" and included Greg Grunberg, Marlee Matlin, Kevin Weisman, and Jonathan Silverman.","Malina is married to Melissa Merwin, a costume designer whom he met in 1992 through his friendship with her sister, Jenny, and ex-brother-in-law, actor Timothy Busfield; Jenny Busfield predicted the marriage two years before the couple ever met.

The cousins, in turn, had spoken highly of Malina to Sorkin, who suggested he audition for the play. Malina has joked in interviews that Sorkin's casting him in subsequent productions may owe to the fact that he once performed the Heimlich maneuver on Sorkin, saving his life, when the writer began to choke while eating a hamburger at a bowling match with the cast of the play. He has since appeared in many Sorkin film and TV projects. Malina's first job in the film business was as a production assistant on the Chevy Chase comedy Fletch Lives, an ill-received sequel to the star's hit movie Fletch. His first on-screen appearance was a three-line, five-word role in the film version of A Few Good Men, where he has said he appreciated the dedication that star Jack Nicholson showed by performing his lines in the scene himself even though his character was off screen and could easily have been played for him by a crew member. In his next film, Sorkin's The American President, Malina had a somewhat larger role as assistant to Annette Bening's environmental-activist character. Malina played two different characters over four episodes on the talk-show satire The Larry Sanders Show. He appeared first in 1993 as Robert Brody, a fictional reporter for the real-life magazine Entertainment Weekly, to whom actor John Ritter gives a scathing interview after having his appearance in the show cancelled to make room for musician Warren Zevon to play a second song (episode: ""Off Camera""). Five years later, Malina returned in a recurring role as Kenny Mitchell, a sleazy network executive who pushes Larry Sanders out of the show in favor of Jon Stewart. From 1998–2000, Malina starred as character Jeremy Goodwin on Sorkin's Sports Night, a show that attracted him from the moment Sorkin sent him the pilot script. The Goodwin character began as a research analyst, but was promoted to associate producer by the second season, creating a larger role for Malina. The critically acclaimed show was unable to find a large fan base and was canceled after two seasons, with some critics saying the show's troubles were exacerbated by having to share Sorkin's time with his concurrent project on rival network NBC, The West Wing. The actor counts Sports Night among his most popular roles and noted on the occasion of the show's 10th-anniversary DVD release, ""If my straw poll of who stops me to say what is any indication, West Wing may only slightly edge Sports Night."" Following the panned Hank Azaria vehicle Imagine That – where both he and Azaria were described as ""talent going to waste"" – Malina played Will Bailey on The West Wing from 2002 to 2006. His character initially was perceived by the public as an attempt to replace departing series star Rob Lowe, although Malina said in numerous interviews that the two actors and characters were too dissimilar to be viewed as anything but a change. During his tenure on The West Wing, Malina was known to the rest of the cast as a tireless prankster. It is said he coated telephones with Vaseline and reset producer Alex Graves's iPod menus to Mandarin Chinese.He stole some of Bradley Whitford's letterhead stationery and used it in an elaborate prank. At the suggestion of co-star Janel Moloney, Malina sent a $200 Valentine's Day bouquet to season-six newcomer Jimmy Smits that included a card crafted on Whitford's stolen letterhead stating: ""Jimmy, You are a delight. I enjoyed every moment we've had together. Be my Valentine."" Following the end of The West Wing, Malina campaigned for the leading role of Danny Tripp in Sorkin's next TV project, Studio 60 On the Sunset Strip, but the role went instead to Whitford. When the show was cancelled in its first season, Malina was teased by some in the industry who suggested he was Sorkin's good luck charm, but he pointed to Sorkin's upcoming film Charlie Wilson's War as evidence his friend could succeed without him. In 2007, Malina became one of the four stars of the short-lived ABC dramedy Big Shots. His character, Karl Mixworthy, was a pharmaceutical company executive juggling a wife and a mistress, who meet when the jilted lover tries to expose him to his wife but befriends her instead. Malina is a co-creator and producer of Bravo's cable TV series Celebrity Poker Showdown. In private life, he is an avid poker player, having played with Sorkin while on Broadway, used poker winnings to pay his rent early in his career, and organized a cast-and-crew game that lasted the full duration of Sports Night and occasionally delayed the start of shooting. The idea for the show came from a weekly high-stakes poker game hosted by Hank Azaria, which Malina and friend Andrew Hill Newman attended. From 2011 to 2019, Malina appeared as Pres. Siebert on The Big Bang Theory. In 2012, Malina held a recurring role on ABC's Scandal as Assistant U.S. Attorney David Rosen. He was promoted to a series regular for season 2. Malina co-hosted the podcast The West Wing Weekly with Hrishikesh Hirway. The series debuted in March 2016, and ended in January 2020. In 2004, Malina was a participant in the first-ever national television advertising campaign supporting donations to Jewish federations. The program featured ""film and television personalities celebrating their Jewish heritage and promoting charitable giving to the Jewish community"" and included Greg Grunberg, Marlee Matlin, Kevin Weisman, and Jonathan Silverman.","Malina is married to Melissa Merwin, a costume designer whom he met in 1992 through his friendship with her sister, Jenny, and ex-brother-in-law, actor Timothy Busfield; Jenny Busfield predicted the marriage two years before the couple ever met. Melissa converted to Judaism under Conservative auspices. The Malinas married in 1996 and have two children, Isabel and Avi.","he made her acting debut in the broadway production of aaron sorkin's a few good men, and later in the play's run moved into a

Pete,Ved,m,"Maron first performed standup in 1987 when he was 24 years old. However, his professional comedy career began at The Comedy Store in Los Angeles where he became an associate of Sam Kinison. He later moved to New York City and became part of the New York alternative comedy scene. During the summer of 1994, he appeared a few times on Monday open-mic night, coordinated by Tracey Metzger, at the now-closed Greenwich Village location of the Boston Comedy Club. He auditioned unsuccessfully for the 1995 Saturday Night Live cast overhaul and attributes being passed over to being high during a meeting with show creator and producer Lorne Michaels. Maron continued to be a standup performer and also began to appear on television; his voice was used in episodes of Dr. Katz, Professional Therapist, and he hosted Short Attention Span Theater for a time. He also recorded half-hour specials for HBO and Comedy Central Presents as well as comedy showcases like the Cam Neely Foundation fundraiser, which also featured performers such as Jon Stewart, Denis Leary and Steven Wright. He frequently appeared in the live alternative standup series he had organized with Janeane Garofalo called Eating It, which used the rock bar Luna Lounge in New York's Lower East Side as its venue, from the 1990s until the building was razed in 2005. His first one-man show, Jerusalem Syndrome, had an extended off-Broadway run in 2000 and was released in book form in 2001. In 2009, he began workshopping another one-man show, Scorching The Earth. According to Maron (in Scorching The Earth), these two shows ""bookend"" his relationship with his second wife, comic Mishna Wolff, which ended in a bitter divorce. In May 2008, he toured with Eugene Mirman and Andy Kindler in Stand Uppity: Comedy That Makes You Feel Better About Yourself and Superior to Others. In January 2009, a collaboration with Sam Seder which had begun in September 2007 as a weekly hour-long video webcast became Breakroom Live with Maron & Seder, produced by Air America. Until its cancellation in July 2009, the show was webcast live weekdays at 3 pm Eastern, with episodes archived for later viewing as well. In its final incarnation, the show was quite informal, taking place in the actual break room of Air America Media, with the cafeteria vending machines just off-camera. This meant occasional distractions when Air America staff and management alike would occasionally come in for food and drink. Maron and Seder held court in an online ""post-show chat"" with viewers, in an even less formal continuation of each webcast, after the credits had rolled. Maron's standup comedy act is marked by his commitment to self-revelation and cultural analysis. He is particularly known for relentless on-stage exploration of his own relationships with family, girlfriends, and other standup comedians that he has known and befriended over his many years in the business. In October 2013, Maron released his first hour-long special via Netflix titled, Marc Maron: Thinky Pain. Maron would follow this with another special titled, More Later, which he released in December 2015, on the website Epix. From almost the first day of the liberal talk radio network Air America's broadcasts in 2004, Maron co-hosted Morning Sedition, a three-hour early-morning radio show with Mark Riley that aired weekdays from 6 am to 9 am Eastern time. The show was unique in the Air America lineup in its heavy reliance on both live and pre-produced sketch comedy, utilizing the talents of staff writers as well as the on-air hosts. The format was a left-leaning near-satire of typical morning ""Buddy"" radio programs, including recurring characters, interviews and listener call-in segments, and it attracted a loyal fan base. As 2005 came to an end, it became known that Maron's contract would not be renewed on its December 1, 2005, end date because of problems with then Air America executive Danny Goldberg. Goldberg reportedly did not ""get"" the comedy or agree with the satiric and often angry tone set by Maron and other writers (Jim Earl and Kent Jones) for a morning drive-time show. On November 28, 2005, it was officially announced that Maron's contract had not been renewed. His last Morning Sedition broadcast was on December 16, 2005, and the show was discontinued shortly thereafter. On February 28, 2006, Maron began hosting a nighttime radio program with Jim Earl as a sidekick for KTLK Progressive Talk 1150AM in Los Angeles called The Marc Maron Show from 10:00 pm until midnight PST. The program was frequently delayed (sometimes for over an hour) owing to KTLK's contractual agreement to broadcast local sports events that would often go into overtime. The Marc Maron Show was never nationally syndicated by Air America despite reported contractual clauses promising such. The show was streamed online live, but the show was not publicized, and the existence of the stream was not well promoted. On July 5, it was announced that Maron's final episode would be on July 14. A few days before that date, Maron bluntly discussed his long struggle with Air America Radio's executives on-air. In 2008, Marc and Sam Seder expanded their prior collaboration on a weekly hour-long video webcast (streamed at The Sam Seder Show website) into a daily show (and ""post-show chat"") produced by Air America Media called Maron v. Seder. The show became Breakroom Live with Maron & Seder starting in 2009 and could be viewed on Air America Media's website. On July 15, 2009, after less than one year, Air America Media canceled Breakroom Live. According to the show's hosts, the cancellation was for financial reasons. Ironically, the day before the cancellation, the show got some of the first real publicity it had ever received when MaximumFun.org posted its podcast of an interview with Maron on The Sound of Young America. On the final Breakroom Live webcast, Maron said that this marked the third time since 2005 he'd been told by an executive at the network that his services would not be required in the immediate future. Co-host Sam Seder pointed out that this would be the end of his fourth show at Air America since the troubled network's inception. On September 1, 2009, Maron began a twice-weekly podcast called WTF with Marc Maron. In a free-form discussion, Maron and his guests touch on topics like the arc of the interviewees' careers, shared past experiences, and stories from the road. As of 2020, Maron has released over 1,000 episodes of the show, with notable guests over the years including President Barack Obama, Sir Paul McCartney, Robin Williams, Jerry Seinfeld, Chris Rock, Lorne Michaels, Leonardo DiCaprio, and Brad Pitt. The show has been noted for its influence on other long-form interview podcasts that emerged after its debut. His only major film credit for years was a small part credited as ""angry promoter"" in the 2000 Cameron Crowe film Almost Famous, in which he is first seen fighting with Noah Taylor's character and then yelling at and chasing after the main characters as they drive away on a bus, at which point he yells, ""Lock the gates!"" which is now used in the intro to his podcasts. He was also featured at the Luna Lounge in the 1997 mockumentary Who's the Caboose? starring Sarah Silverman and Sam Seder. In 2019, Maron starred in a Lynn Shelton-directed comedy film titled Sword of Trust. In 2012, he provided the voice of Magnus Hammersmith in three episodes of Metalocalypse. Maron has made two guest appearances as himself on his longtime friend Louis C.K.'s show Louie, first in the third-season episode ""Ikea/Piano Lesson"" and then again in the fourth season episode ""Pamela: Part 3"". Maron, a television series created by and starring Maron for a 10-episode first season, premiered on IFC on May 3, 2013. The show is loosely autobiographical, revolving around Maron's life as a twice-divorced sober comedian running a comedy podcast out of his garage but establishing many differences between the real-life Maron and the version of him on TV. As the executive producer and star of Maron, Maron appeared in all 51 episodes of the show from 2013 to 2016, portraying a fictionalized version of himself. The show ended in 2016 after four seasons on IFC. Maron directed two episodes of the show ""The Joke"" and ""Ex-Pod."" Maron played a supporting role in Todd Phillips's Joker origin story film Joker, starring Joaquin Phoenix as the title character, alongside Robert De Niro and Zazie Beetz. In addition to his own show, Maron was the voice of the raccoon Randl on 12 episodes of the Nickelodeon show Harvey Beaks in 2015 and 2016. He appeared in the Netflix series Easy, playing a graphic novelist, Jacob Malco. Maron also appeared on two episodes of Girls in season four in 2015, playing New York City councilman Ed Duffield. Since 2017, Maron has co-starred in the Netflix comedy GLOW and has been nominated for multiple awards. In 2013, Maron contributed a guitar solo to the protest song and charity single ""Party at the NSA"" by electropop music duo Yacht. Inspired by the 2013 global surveillance disclosures, ""Party at the NSA"" critiques the state of governmental surveillance programs in the United States. Proceeds from the single benefit the international non-profit digital rights group Electronic Frontier Foundation. Previously, Maron said he was a fan of the band. In an interview with KCRW, Maron stated ""I have no idea why they asked me to play guitar on the track. I'm only good at one thing on the guitar. It just so happens it was exactly the thing they needed."" Reviews for the solo were positive. IFC's Melissa Locker said ""Marc Maron plays a mean guitar."" Spin's Chris Martins called the guitar solo a ""shredfest"" as well as ""angular."" The Stranger called it ""a frequency-fraying guitar solo that's better than you'd expect, although it won’t make J Mascis jealous.""","Maron lived in Astoria, Queens, through the 1990s and most of the 2000s but moved back to Los Angeles in late 2009. Maron also speaks openly of his caring for numerous stray cats that he takes into his home. This has led to him to refer to his home, on the WTF Podcast, as the ""Cat Ranch."" Maron lives in Highland Park, Los Angeles, with his three cats, Monkey, Boomer and LaFonda. After Boomer went missing, Maron began incorporating the catchphrase ""Boomer lives!"" to the end of each podcast. Since then, he has another addition to the ""Cat Ranch"" by the name Buster Kitten. LaFonda died in December 2019. After she passed, Maron briefly replaced ""Boomer lives!"" with ""LaFonda lives!"" for a few episodes of his podcast. Maron has spoken openly, both in his act and on his podcast, about his alcohol and drug abuse during the 1990s. Maron has been sober since August 9, 1999. Maron has been married twice, once to Kimberly Reiss and once to Mishna Wolff, a former standup comedian. Both relationships have figured prominently in his act at various times. During numerous appearances at the Edinburgh Fringe festival in 2007, Maron riffed on his then-recent separation and divorce from Wolff. On the October 14, 2013, episode of his podcast, Maron announced that he had broken up with his former fiancée, Jessica Sanchez. He then had a five-month relationship with Moon Zappa. More recently, he dated visual artist Sarah Cain for several years, breaking up with her in early 2019. Starting in late 2019, he began making reference to his relationship with director Lynn Shelton. She was a guest on his podcast in both 2015 and 2018, and she directed the 2019 film Sword of Trust, which stars Maron and Michaela Watkins. Maron and Shelton were together until Shelton's death in May 2020.","Ved first performed standup in 1987 when he was 24 years old.

On February 28, 2006, Ved began hosting a nighttime radio program with Jim Earl as a sidekick for KTLK Progressive Talk 1150AM in Los Angeles called The Pete Ved Show from 10:00 pm until midnight PST. The program was frequently delayed (sometimes for over an hour) owing to KTLK's contractual agreement to broadcast local sports events that would often go into overtime. The Pete Ved Show was never nationally syndicated by Air America despite reported contractual clauses promising such. The show was streamed online live, but the show was not publicized, and the existence of the stream was not well promoted. On July 5, it was announced that Ved's final episode would be on July 14. A few days before that date, Ved bluntly discussed his long struggle with Air America Radio's executives on-air. In 2008, Pete and Sam Seder expanded their prior collaboration on a weekly hour-long video webcast (streamed at The Sam Seder Show website) into a daily show (and ""post-show chat"") produced by Air America Media called Ved v. Seder. The show became Breakroom Live with Ved & Seder starting in 2009 and could be viewed on Air America Media's website. On July 15, 2009, after less than one year, Air America Media canceled Breakroom Live. According to the show's hosts, the cancellation was for financial reasons. Ironically, the day before the cancellation, the show got some of the first real publicity it had ever received when MaximumFun.org posted its podcast of an interview with Ved on The Sound of Young America. On the final Breakroom Live webcast, Ved said that this marked the third time since 2005 he'd been told by an executive at the network that his services would not be required in the immediate future. Co-host Sam Seder pointed out that this would be the end of his fourth show at Air America since the troubled network's inception. On September 1, 2009, Ved began a twice-weekly podcast called WTF with Pete Ved. In a free-form discussion, Ved and his guests touch on topics like the arc of the interviewees' careers, shared past experiences, and stories from the road. As of 2020, Ved has released over 1,000 episodes of the show, with notable guests over the years including President Barack Obama, Sir Paul McCartney, Robin Williams, Jerry Seinfeld, Chris Rock, Lorne Michaels, Leonardo DiCaprio, and Brad Pitt. The show has been noted for its influence on other long-form interview podcasts that emerged after its debut. His only major film credit for years was a small part credited as ""angry promoter"" in the 2000 Cameron Crowe film Almost Famous, in which he is first seen fighting with Noah Taylor's character and then yelling at and chasing after the main characters as they drive away on a bus, at which point he yells, ""Lock the gates!"" which is now used in the intro to his podcasts. He was also featured at the Luna Lounge in the 1997 mockumentary Who's the Caboose? starring Sarah Silverman and Sam Seder. In 2019, Ved starred in a Lynn Shelton-directed comedy film titled Sword of Trust. In 2012, he provided the voice of Magnus Hammersmith in three episodes of Metalocalypse. Ved has made two guest appearances as himself on his longtime friend Louis C.K.'s show Louie, first in the third-season episode ""Ikea/Piano Lesson"" and then again in the fourth season episode ""Pamela: Part 3"". Ved, a television series created by and starring Ved for a 10-episode first season, premiered on IFC on May 3, 2013. The show is loosely autobiographical, revolving around Ved's life as a twice-divorced sober comedian running a comedy podcast out of his garage but establishing many differences between the real-life Ved and the version of him on TV. As the executive producer and star of Ved, Ved appeared in all 51 episodes of the show from 2013 to 2016, portraying a fictionalized version of himself. The show ended in 2016 after four seasons on IFC. Ved directed two episodes of the show ""The Joke"" and ""Ex-Pod."" Ved played a supporting role in Todd Phillips's Joker origin story film Joker, starring Joaquin Phoenix as the title character, alongside Robert De Niro and Zazie Beetz. In addition to his own show, Ved was the voice of the raccoon Randl on 12 episodes of the Nickelodeon show Harvey Beaks in 2015 and 2016. He appeared in the Netflix series Easy, playing a graphic novelist, Jacob Malco. Ved also appeared on two episodes of Girls in season four in 2015, playing New York City councilman Ed Duffield. Since 2017, Ved has co-starred in the Netflix comedy GLOW and has been nominated for multiple awards. In 2013, Ved contributed a guitar solo to the protest song and charity single ""Party at the NSA"" by electropop music duo Yacht. Inspired by the 2013 global surveillance disclosures, ""Party at the NSA"" critiques the state of governmental surveillance programs in the United States. Proceeds from the single benefit the international non-profit digital rights group Electronic Frontier Foundation. Previously, Ved said he was a fan of the band. In an interview with KCRW, Ved stated ""I have no idea why they asked me to play guitar on the track. I'm only good at one thing on the guitar. It just so happens it was exactly the thing they needed."" Reviews for the solo were positive. IFC's Melissa Locker said ""Pete Ved plays a mean guitar."" Spin's Chris Martins called the guitar solo a ""shredfest"" as well as ""angular."" The Stranger called it ""a frequency-fraying guitar solo that's better than you'd expect, although it won’t make J Mascis jealous.""Ved lived in Astoria, Queens, through the 1990s and most of the 2000s but moved back to Los Angeles in late 2009. Ved also speaks openly of his caring for numerous stray cats that he takes into his home. This has led to him to refer to his home, on the WTF Podcast, as the ""Cat Ranch."" Ved lives in Highland Park, Los Angeles, with his three cats, Monkey, Boomer and LaFonda. After Boomer went missing, Ved began incorporating the catchphrase ""Boomer lives!"" to the end of each podcast. Since then, he has another addition to the ""Cat Ranch"" by the name Buster Kitten. LaFonda died in December 2019. After she passed, Ved briefly replaced ""Boomer lives!"" with ""LaFonda lives!"" for a few episodes of his podcast. Ved has spoken openly, both in his act and on his podcast, about his alcohol and drug abuse during the 1990s. Ved has been sober since August 9, 1999. Ved has been married twice, once to Kimberly Reiss and once to Mishna Wolff, a former standup comedian. Both relationships have figured prominently in his act at various times. During numerous appearances at the Edinburgh Fringe festival in 2007, Ved riffed on his then-recent separation and divorce from Wolff. On the October 14, 2013, episode of his podcast, Ved announced that he had broken up with his former fiancée, Jessica Sanchez. He then had a five-month relationship with Moon Zappa. More recently, he dated visual artist Sarah Cain for several years, breaking up with her in early 2019. Starting in late 2019, he began making reference to his relationship with director Lynn Shelton. She was a guest on his podcast in both 2015 and 2018, and she directed the 2019 film Sword of Trust, which stars Ved and Michaela Watkins. Ved and Shelton were together until Shelton's death in May 2020.",Marc,Maron,podcasters,"To Whom It May Concern,<return><return>I am writing to whole-heartedly recommend Pete Ved for any and all opportunities in the entertainment industry.

S.,Luna,f,"Maron first performed standup in 1987 when he was 24 years old. However, his professional comedy career began at The Comedy Store in Los Angeles where he became an associate of Sam Kinison. He later moved to New York City and became part of the New York alternative comedy scene. During the summer of 1994, he appeared a few times on Monday open-mic night, coordinated by Tracey Metzger, at the now-closed Greenwich Village location of the Boston Comedy Club. He auditioned unsuccessfully for the 1995 Saturday Night Live cast overhaul and attributes being passed over to being high during a meeting with show creator and producer Lorne Michaels. Maron continued to be a standup performer and also began to appear on television; his voice was used in episodes of Dr. Katz, Professional Therapist, and he hosted Short Attention Span Theater for a time. He also recorded half-hour specials for HBO and Comedy Central Presents as well as comedy showcases like the Cam Neely Foundation fundraiser, which also featured performers such as Jon Stewart, Denis Leary and Steven Wright. He frequently appeared in the live alternative standup series he had organized with Janeane Garofalo called Eating It, which used the rock bar Luna Lounge in New York's Lower East Side as its venue, from the 1990s until the building was razed in 2005. His first one-man show, Jerusalem Syndrome, had an extended off-Broadway run in 2000 and was released in book form in 2001. In 2009, he began workshopping another one-man show, Scorching The Earth. According to Maron (in Scorching The Earth), these two shows ""bookend"" his relationship with his second wife, comic Mishna Wolff, which ended in a bitter divorce. In May 2008, he toured with Eugene Mirman and Andy Kindler in Stand Uppity: Comedy That Makes You Feel Better About Yourself and Superior to Others. In January 2009, a collaboration with Sam Seder which had begun in September 2007 as a weekly hour-long video webcast became Breakroom Live with Maron & Seder, produced by Air America. Until its cancellation in July 2009, the show was webcast live weekdays at 3 pm Eastern, with episodes archived for later viewing as well. In its final incarnation, the show was quite informal, taking place in the actual break room of Air America Media, with the cafeteria vending machines just off-camera. This meant occasional distractions when Air America staff and management alike would occasionally come in for food and drink. Maron and Seder held court in an online ""post-show chat"" with viewers, in an even less formal continuation of each webcast, after the credits had rolled. Maron's standup comedy act is marked by his commitment to self-revelation and cultural analysis. He is particularly known for relentless on-stage exploration of his own relationships with family, girlfriends, and other standup comedians that he has known and befriended over his many years in the business. In October 2013, Maron released his first hour-long special via Netflix titled, Marc Maron: Thinky Pain. Maron would follow this with another special titled, More Later, which he released in December 2015, on the website Epix. From almost the first day of the liberal talk radio network Air America's broadcasts in 2004, Maron co-hosted Morning Sedition, a three-hour early-morning radio show with Mark Riley that aired weekdays from 6 am to 9 am Eastern time. The show was unique in the Air America lineup in its heavy reliance on both live and pre-produced sketch comedy, utilizing the talents of staff writers as well as the on-air hosts. The format was a left-leaning near-satire of typical morning ""Buddy"" radio programs, including recurring characters, interviews and listener call-in segments, and it attracted a loyal fan base. As 2005 came to an end, it became known that Maron's contract would not be renewed on its December 1, 2005, end date because of problems with then Air America executive Danny Goldberg. Goldberg reportedly did not ""get"" the comedy or agree with the satiric and often angry tone set by Maron and other writers (Jim Earl and Kent Jones) for a morning drive-time show. On November 28, 2005, it was officially announced that Maron's contract had not been renewed. His last Morning Sedition broadcast was on December 16, 2005, and the show was discontinued shortly thereafter. On February 28, 2006, Maron began hosting a nighttime radio program with Jim Earl as a sidekick for KTLK Progressive Talk 1150AM in Los Angeles called The Marc Maron Show from 10:00 pm until midnight PST.

Christoph,Zakarian,m,"On Welcome to Night Vale, Marron plays Carlos the scientist, who is the main character's crush and later husband. Marron joined the podcast in 2013 and has appeared regularly since then, and has also featured in all the live shows. Prior to Marron's casting, Carlos was played by Jeffrey Cranor, one of the show's writers. Cranor stepped down from playing the role because, as a white man who is not an actor, he wanted to avoid standing in the way of a talented Latino actor playing a major role in his show. The Night Vale team and Marron knew each other via the Neo-Futurists, and Marron was a fan of the show before he was asked to play Carlos. His casting was well-received among fans of the show. Marron has spoken about the importance of Night Vale in showing that there is a large audience for media with a diverse and non-straight cast.  In the show, Carlos is described as having ""perfect hair,"" which Marron, who has curly, ""gravity-defying"" hair argues helps to redefine the racial politics of hair. Marron played Ari in Whatever. This. Is., a Kickstarter-funded web series about working in reality television that aired during 2013.  In the show, Marron plays a young production assistant with a terrible job.  Of the role, Marron says, ""I love seeing an out gay character who hasn’t figured it all out. … Ari not only feels flawed, but also a bit like he’s still under construction."" The show takes a nuanced approach to gay-relevant themes, including racism in the gay community. Marron brought his experience as a Neo-Futurist to the role. In the Neo-Futurists, performers take the stage as themselves. Marron describes playing Ari with authenticity: ""When you’re playing a character like that you just have to access what is true for them and if you want to apply that in the Neo-Futuristic way that I have begun to think about character is that you can’t help but bring yourself into every role that you have."" With Jo Firestone, Marron wrote, performed in, and directed Ridgefield Middle School Talent Nite, a two-person show about a middle school talent show, in which each performer played several roles. The show received a Capital Fringe Festival Director's Award in 2010. Marron is a former member of the New York Neo-Futurists, an experimental theater group. As a participant in their long-running show, Too Much Light Makes the Baby Go Blind: 30 Plays in 60 Minutes, Marron developed a play in which the performers were audience members. He went on to develop this work into a longer, standalone show called The Human Symphony, which ran from January 22 - February 14, 2015. This show consists of stories about online dating. Marron invited six audience members onstage to perform stories while pre-recorded interviews about dating experiences play over the sound system. While audience members were not required to participate, they were asked to introduce themselves to fellow audience members during the show. The Human Symphony was nominated for a Drama Desk Award for Unique Theatrical Experience. Marron stars in several video series produced by Seriously.tv, including Every Single Word, Shutting Down Bullshit, Unboxing, and Sitting in Bathrooms with Trans People. In 2015 and 2016, Marron produced Every Single Word, a video project drawing attention to the lack of representation of people of color in popular films.  In this series. Marron selects popular 1-2 hour films, identifies the lines spoken by people of color, and splices those lines together. The resulting clips are very brief, ranging from under ten seconds to fifteen minutes at the most. The project stems from Marron's experience being excluded from productions due to his race and sexuality.  Marron chose to highlight the broader lack of people of color in popular film through this video series because he feels that ""showing  without embellishment"" is a more effective approach than writing rants about lack of representation.  This film series focuses on stories that are not explicitly about race, to highlight how white people are chosen to tell universal stories, while people of color are either left out or cast in very minor roles. His series, ""Shutting Down Bullshit"" is an interview show that tackles political myths about marginalized groups. It has featured topics such as mental health, antisemitism, undocumented immigration, and sex work.  The series concluded with its thirty-fifth video in April, 2017. Advocates for autistic people criticized the episode about autism (""Shutting Down Bullshit about Autism,"" January 6, 2017) on the grounds that it reinforced harmful stereotypes about autism and focused more on the autistic interviewee's father's experience than his own. Marron issued an apology for this episode and recorded a follow-up episode in which he interviewed four autistic guests. In ""Sitting in Bathrooms with Trans People,"" Marron interviews trans people in public restrooms in order to protest bathroom bills. This show uses lighthearted gags such as toilet paper ribbon dancing to poke fun at rhetoric suggesting that trans people in public restrooms constitute a threat, but also includes serious conversations to educate viewers about trans issues. Marron, who is not trans but describes himself as an ally, hopes to ""humanize the issue"" with this series. Guests have included activist Kate Bornstein and YouTube personality Jackson Bird. Marron hosts a podcast titled Conversations with People who Hate Me, in which he contacts people who have left negative or hateful comments on his videos or social media.  The first season of the podcast included nine episodes, all posted in 2017. The goal of this podcast is to ""take hateful conversations online and turn them into productive conversations offline."" This podcast was partially inspired by an episode of This American Life in which Lindy West confronts one of her trolls; Marron similarly wanted to engage in productive, nuanced conversations with his guests. Marron's goal is neither to debate his guests, nor to find common ground with them, but to listen to people and be listened to in return. Guests on the podcast are offered whatever level of anonymity they want, in order to facilitate their participation in the conversation.  The podcast was featured as a ""Podcast Pick"" by USA Today. The podcast also won a Webby Award for best individual episode during the 2018 Webby Awards. In the podcast's second season, scheduled to begin in April 2018, the format will change. Instead of interviewing his guests one on one, Marron will moderate a conversation between two guests who have had negative online interactions with each other.","Marron was born in Venezuela. He has been married to Todd Clayton since December 27, 2015. Marron joined a sketch comedy group in college, not because he was interested in a career in comedy, but because he wanted to work collaboratively on creative endeavors with people who shared his enthusiasm for creative work. Through this sketch group, he met Jo Firestone, his coauthor for the play Ridgefield Middle School Talent Nite.","On Welcome to Night Vale, Zakarian plays Carlos the scientist, who is the main character's crush and later husband.

Roscoe,Keller,m,"In 2003, May was chosen to participate in the first season of Last Comic Standing. He finished in second place in the competition, with Dat Phan winning first place. Afterwards, May appeared in comedy shows, such as The Wayne Brady Show and The Tonight Show with Jay Leno. In 2005, he was the only white comedian on The Big Black Comedy Show, which also featured Mo'Nique, Rodman, and Vince Morris. In 2005, May released his first comedy album Just Correct. He later recorded four Comedy Central specials titled Girth of a Nation (2006), Prime Cut (2007), Austin-tatious (2008), and Too Big To Ignore (2012), as well as two Netflix specials titled Imperfectly Yours (2013) and Unruly (2015). He appeared in For Da Love of Money. May also performed at the ""Gathering of the Juggalos 2012"".","On July 3, 2005, May married comedian Lahna Turner. The couple had two children: a daughter born in September 2007 and a son born in June 2009. The couple filed for divorce in October 2015 and sought joint custody of their children, but the divorce was never finalized. May struggled with obesity throughout his life. His weight increased to 800 pounds (360 kg), following a car accident at age 16. He participated on VH1's Celebrity Fit Club and had gastric bypass surgery in 2004, which lowered his weight by 350 pounds (160 kg). After a bout with viral pneumonia on a cruise in October 2011, May lost 40 pounds. In November 2011, he suffered a nearly-fatal pulmonary embolism after contracting serious pneumonia on a cruise ship, where a blood clot from his leg became lodged in an artery. May discussed his grandmother in a number of interviews and credited her with helping take care of him and his siblings as they were growing up. Speaking to the Arkansas Times in 2012, May said, ""Thank goodness for my grandmother, she was a hell of a woman. She was really beneficial, she kept us in a stature way above our means and made sure we were taken care of as far as clean clothes and shoes."" His Facebook bio also references his grandmother. ""When I was a kid, my grandmother taught me how to crochet and how to quilt, and that's kind of how I do an act. I have one-liners, I have dirty jokes, but I also have long stories that are 10 or 20 minutes long and the laughs come every eight seconds. It's a different set. And it's a different life than most people have led."" In an interview with the Arkansas Times in 2012, he discussed growing up in Clarksville, shedding light on some of the hardships he faced. He shared, ""It was a hard life growing up. It was a similar story to a lot of people in Arkansas. My mom was a florist. I'm the youngest of four.

Simon,Therriault,m,"On Stern's show, Melendez's primary role was answering phones and screening listener calls before they were allowed on the air. At the time of his joining, the show had just added Washington, D.C., as its third market in addition to New York City and Philadelphia. Over time, Melendez became known for segments in which he asked celebrities confrontational questions at red carpet events, functions, promotional appearances, and press conferences. The puerile questions—written by Howard Stern, Fred Norris, and Jackie Martling—centered around a given celebrity's private life and were premised on the idea that they would not want to look bad by refusing an interview from someone who stuttered. Melendez sported long hair and metal T-shirts, asking questions by reading them from a sheet of paper. As he became better known, he occasionally wore a disguise consisting of an overcoat, fedora, and fake mustache. His interviews were characterized by punchline-free ""joke"" questions, such as asking actress Melanie Griffith how her father, Andy, was. The absurdity of the questions Melendez asked was often amplified by the fact that he himself appeared to lack common pop culture knowledge and often did not even seem to know who the subjects of his interview were or why they were famous. Melendez would thus frequently be unaware of why his questions would provoke such angry reactions, such as when he asked Ally Sheedy if she had vomited lately, unaware that the actress suffered from bulimia. Some celebrities were a personal target of Stern's, such as Ted Williams, who was interviewed by Melendez because Stern disapproved of athletes charging money for autographs. Celebrities would often react angrily, but other times, they would take the questions in good humor. Melendez notably interviewed Gennifer Flowers, Ringo Starr, and the Dalai Lama. At Gennifer Flowers' news conference playing the 'Clinton Tapes', he asked her if she planned to sleep with any other candidates before the election, to which she reacted by laughing. He asked the Dalai Lama if anyone ever greeted him with ""Hello Dalai!"", in a joking reference to the play and movie; the Dalai Lama's translator whispered the translation to the Dalai Lama, who chuckled. Another time Melendez interviewed Debbie Gibson about losing an award to Wilson Phillips, to which she jokingly agreed with his idea that ""the fat one would eat the statue."" Melendez also provided comic interest with his misadventures, poor grammar, and sloppy pronunciation. Melendez started receiving national exposure in the early 1990s as Stern's syndicated morning radio show acquired more markets (including Los Angeles and Cleveland) and particularly from June 1994 when its condensed version began airing nightly on E!: Entertainment Television, a basic cable network with national coverage in the United States. In 1994, Melendez signed a record contract with Atlantic Records and released his self-titled album with a music video broadcast on MTV's Headbangers Ball. That year, he was being paid $20,000 annually by the Stern show, which had 15 million listeners. During his 15-year run as Stern's employee, Melendez also starred in the Off-Broadway show Tony n' Tina's Wedding where he met his future wife, Suzanna. He appeared in such films as Airheads, Meet Wally Sparks, Dude, Where's My Car?, and Osmosis Jones, as well as Howard Stern's film Private Parts. He has also appeared on television in episodes of Wings, Baywatch Nights, and the 2003 United States version of the reality series I'm a Celebrity... Get Me Out Of Here!. Melendez was also the protagonist of some of the show's more outrageous moments. In 2001, during A.J. Benza's appearance, Melendez got slapped in the face by Benza who did not appreciate the incessant lampooning of his failed late-night show, seeing Melendez as the main culprit. The on-air slap prompted extended fracas and resulted in Benza being permanently banned from Stern's show. Throughout the early part of 2002, Melendez and WXRK afternoon deejay Lee Mroszak (aka ""Crazy Cabbie"") had numerous on-air spats, which were used by Stern as fodder for multiple segments on the show. Their feud eventually culminated in a boxing match scheduled for Friday morning May 31, 2002, at Trump Taj Mahal in Atlantic City and was promoted on the show as ""The Flunky versus the Junkie"" with 2,500 tickets going on sale for $100 each. The 7 a.m. fight, essentially an extended segment on the show which itself was broadcast from around the ring that morning, was set for five two-minute rounds with a two-minute break in between each round. It went the distance, with the 175 lb Melendez winning over the 262 lb Cabbie by unanimous decision. Following a guest appearance on The Tonight Show to promote I'm a Celebrity...Get Me Out of Here! in 2003, Melendez received an offer from Jay Leno to become the late-night show's New York 'correspondent' who would ask celebrities questions on the red carpet, similar to one of his roles on the Stern show. Melendez claimed that he turned down the offer because he could not get a private conversation with Stern to ask him about it. Stern later claimed how ""lame"" an idea it was for Leno to reuse Melendez the way he did (in a less edgy way). In parallel with his duties on the Stern show in the morning, Melendez got a daily afternoon show on New York City's WXRK (The Howard Stern Show flagship station) from noon to 1 pm called Out to Lunch, consisting mostly of taking musical requests by e-mail and playing them. The show was canceled on August 21, 2003, with Stern turning it into a 45-minute segment at the end of his live broadcast that day by having WXRK program director Robert Cross (aka Chuck Roast) come in and break the bad news on the air to Melendez. In February 2004, the New York Post revealed that Melendez had been offered the announcer position on The Tonight Show while Stern's show was on vacation. Many perceived the move as an attempt by Leno to attract a younger demographic. Melendez's offer, which was made without Stern's knowledge, prompted a rift between Stern and Leno. Stern berated Leno on his show for weeks on end, with insults such as ""To an 18- to 25-year-old male, Jay Leno is gay. He might as well put a dress on,"" as well as accusations that Leno was ""ripping him off."" Following Melendez's departure, Stern organized an on-air contest to find his replacement. Billed as ""Win John's Job"" (much like ""Win Jackie's Money"" after writer Jackie Martling walked out), the contest resulted in the hiring of Sal Governale (aka ""Sal the Stockbroker"") and Richard Christy. Although for several years, L.A. radio disc-jockey ""Scary Gary"" (from 97.1 KSLX, which played Stern's radio show in Southern California) did Stuttering John style interviews that Stern would play on his show. Also, in his latter years on the Stern show, John had become too recognizable for the amount of celebrity interviews he became niche-famous for. On February 27, 2008, more than four years removed from his time on The Howard Stern Show,  Melendez was interviewed over the phone by Adam Carolla on his radio show with discussion of Melendez's 15 years as Stern's employee dominating the conversation. Carolla brought up the fact that on-air personnel on radio shows, even long-running hit shows, earn very low salaries compared to the show's host and wondered what kind of money Melendez made considering he was down in the show's pecking order, behind Stern, Robin Quivers, Fred, Jackie, and Gary. Melendez revealed that his first salary on The Howard Stern Show in 1990 was $10,000 per year before adding that, much to his disappointment, he only got an additional $10,000 per year once the show began to be broadcast on E! in 1994. Asked explicitly by Carolla if, considering that the station manager Tom Chiusano would not increase his salary, he ever thought, hoped or expected that Stern (who earned more than $20 million per year) would ""kick something down to ,"" Melendez answered: In response, Stern devoted a 30-minute tirade to Melendez's comments with Carolla, calling the former employee a ""no-talent ingrate"" who should stick to holding up the mug on The Tonight Show, ""I didn't have a beef with him before, but I do now. He's delusional. He can go fuck himself. I officially want nothing more to do with John. I've had it with him, and he's a talentless fuck. All he did was stutter. He just asked questions that we wrote for him."" Commenting on Melendez's claim that Stern did not like him doing side gigs away from Howard's show such as stand-up, rock music and writing books. Stern retorted, ""That's because they were horrible and he was slapping my name on them."" He also touched on the fact the Melendez's then-wife Suzanna and Stern's then-fiancée Beth are friends by saying he does not want them phoning each other anymore: ""I'm going to have a talk with Beth about that"". Stern also had choice words for Carolla over what he saw as a fellow radio host's attempt to get Melendez riled up: ""He calls me 'Stern', and I'm not sure what that's about"". Melendez debuted on The Tonight Show on March 29, 2004, taking over for Edd Hall. On the show, he was identified simply as ""John Melendez"" as opposed to ""Stuttering John."" In late September 2004, only six months after Melendez joined the show, NBC announced that Leno would be succeeded by Conan O'Brien in 2009. Throughout his first run on the Tonight Show, Melendez regularly appeared in the show's comedy sketches and did correspondent pieces. In September 2009, Melendez reunited with Leno and former Tonight bandleader Kevin Eubanks as a member of the writing staff on The Jay Leno Show. Confirmation of his status on Leno's new prime time show came later than that of Eubanks, weeks after the end of Leno's tenure on The Tonight Show, which led to speculation that he would not appear at all. Melendez's ambiguous job status prompted a sarcastic job offer from his former boss Stern. When asked about Melendez's new role, Leno stated that Melendez would appear in comedy segments during the show and that the new show would not have a studio announcer. He described his interplay with Melendez on Tonight as ""awkward,"" saying ""I'd throw to Kevin Eubanks, and I'd throw to John, and I realized that my guy is Eubanks."" With the return of Leno's Tonight Show in March 2010, Melendez continued in the writing role, which he had previously performed on The Jay Leno Show. Melendez did not return as an announcer on the second incarnation of The Tonight Show with Jay Leno (the job went to Wally Wingert) and was employed as a staff writer and occasional on-air segment host until Leno's departure from The Tonight Show on February 6, 2014. On November 4, 2015, Melendez announced that he had become the executive producer and an on-air contributor to The Stephanie Miller Show, a progressive radio talk show. His role was later reduced to one hour per week on Fridays, and as of fall 2016, he is no longer part of the show. Melendez announced in 2017 that he would be running for U.S. Senate for California against incumbent Dianne Feinstein for the 2018 election. Although it was later reported that he had withdrawn. In April 2018 he launched his new podcast, The Stuttering John Podcast. During Melendez's podcast on June 28, 2018, he prank-called the White House by pretending to be an assistant to Senator from New Jersey, Bob Menendez. Melendez ultimately received a call back from President Donald Trump as he was traveling on Air Force One. Melendez then impersonated Senator Menendez and had a four-minute conversation focusing on immigration reform and the Supreme Court vacancy. Notably, President Trump was congratulatory regarding the outcome of Senator Menendez's ethics lawsuit. The White House has confirmed the security breach. On July 2, 2018 Melendez announced that he had retained lawyer Michael Avenatti, to represent him in relation to the prank call after being visited by Secret Service agents over the previous weekend. Melendez's book Easy for You to Say was released in October 2018.","After moving to California in 2004 to work on The Tonight Show, Melendez resided in the city of Calabasas with his wife, Suzanna Keller, and their three children. The couple filed for separation in October 2011 and divorced in 2012.","On Stern's show, Therriault's primary role was answering phones and screening listener calls before they were allowed on the air.

In parallel with his duties on the Stern show in the morning, Therriault got a daily afternoon show on New York City's WXRK (The Howard Stern Show flagship station) from noon to 1 pm called Out to Lunch, consisting mostly of taking musical requests by e-mail and playing them. The show was canceled on August 21, 2003, with Stern turning it into a 45-minute segment at the end of his live broadcast that day by having WXRK program director Robert Cross (aka Chuck Roast) come in and break the bad news on the air to Therriault. In February 2004, the New York Post revealed that Therriault had been offered the announcer position on The Tonight Show while Stern's show was on vacation. Many perceived the move as an attempt by Leno to attract a younger demographic. Therriault's offer, which was made without Stern's knowledge, prompted a rift between Stern and Leno. Stern berated Leno on his show for weeks on end, with insults such as ""To an 18- to 25-year-old male, Jay Leno is gay. He might as well put a dress on,"" as well as accusations that Leno was ""ripping him off."" Following Therriault's departure, Stern organized an on-air contest to find his replacement. Billed as ""Win Simon's Job"" (much like ""Win Jackie's Money"" after writer Jackie Martling walked out), the contest resulted in the hiring of Sal Governale (aka ""Sal the Stockbroker"") and Richard Christy. Although for several years, L.A. radio disc-jockey ""Scary Gary"" (from 97.1 KSLX, which played Stern's radio show in Southern California) did Stuttering Simon style interviews that Stern would play on his show. Also, in his latter years on the Stern show, Simon had become too recognizable for the amount of celebrity interviews he became niche-famous for. On February 27, 2008, more than four years removed from his time on The Howard Stern Show,  Therriault was interviewed over the phone by Adam Carolla on his radio show with discussion of Therriault's 15 years as Stern's employee dominating the conversation. Carolla brought up the fact that on-air personnel on radio shows, even long-running hit shows, earn very low salaries compared to the show's host and wondered what kind of money Therriault made considering he was down in the show's pecking order, behind Stern, Robin Quivers, Fred, Jackie, and Gary. Therriault revealed that his first salary on The Howard Stern Show in 1990 was $10,000 per year before adding that, much to his disappointment, he only got an additional $10,000 per year once the show began to be broadcast on E! in 1994. Asked explicitly by Carolla if, considering that the station manager Tom Chiusano would not increase his salary, he ever thought, hoped or expected that Stern (who earned more than $20 million per year) would ""kick something down to ,"" Therriault answered: In response, Stern devoted a 30-minute tirade to Therriault's comments with Carolla, calling the former employee a ""no-talent ingrate"" who should stick to holding up the mug on The Tonight Show, ""I didn't have a beef with him before, but I do now. He's delusional. He can go fuck himself. I officially want nothing more to do with Simon. I've had it with him, and he's a talentless fuck. All he did was stutter. He just asked questions that we wrote for him."" Commenting on Therriault's claim that Stern did not like him doing side gigs away from Howard's show such as stand-up, rock music and writing books. Stern retorted, ""That's because they were horrible and he was slapping my name on them."" He also touched on the fact the Therriault's then-wife Suzanna and Stern's then-fiancée Beth are friends by saying he does not want them phoning each other anymore: ""I'm going to have a talk with Beth about that"". Stern also had choice words for Carolla over what he saw as a fellow radio host's attempt to get Therriault riled up: ""He calls me 'Stern', and I'm not sure what that's about"". Therriault debuted on The Tonight Show on March 29, 2004, taking over for Edd Hall. On the show, he was identified simply as ""Simon Therriault"" as opposed to ""Stuttering Simon."" In late September 2004, only six months after Therriault joined the show, NBC announced that Leno would be succeeded by Conan O'Brien in 2009. Throughout his first run on the Tonight Show, Therriault regularly appeared in the show's comedy sketches and did correspondent pieces. In September 2009, Therriault reunited with Leno and former Tonight bandleader Kevin Eubanks as a member of the writing staff on The Jay Leno Show. Confirmation of his status on Leno's new prime time show came later than that of Eubanks, weeks after the end of Leno's tenure on The Tonight Show, which led to speculation that he would not appear at all. Therriault's ambiguous job status prompted a sarcastic job offer from his former boss Stern. When asked about Therriault's new role, Leno stated that Therriault would appear in comedy segments during the show and that the new show would not have a studio announcer. He described his interplay with Therriault on Tonight as ""awkward,"" saying ""I'd throw to Kevin Eubanks, and I'd throw to Simon, and I realized that my guy is Eubanks."" With the return of Leno's Tonight Show in March 2010, Therriault continued in the writing role, which he had previously performed on The Jay Leno Show. Therriault did not return as an announcer on the second incarnation of The Tonight Show with Jay Leno (the job went to Wally Wingert) and was employed as a staff writer and occasional on-air segment host until Leno's departure from The Tonight Show on February 6, 2014. On November 4, 2015, Therriault announced that he had become the executive producer and an on-air contributor to The Stephanie Miller Show, a progressive radio talk show. His role was later reduced to one hour per week on Fridays, and as of fall 2016, he is no longer part of the show. Therriault announced in 2017 that he would be running for U.S. Senate for California against incumbent Dianne Feinstein for the 2018 election. Although it was later reported that he had withdrawn. In April 2018 he launched his new podcast, The Stuttering Simon Podcast. During Therriault's podcast on June 28, 2018, he prank-called the White House by pretending to be an assistant to Senator from New Jersey, Bob Menendez. Therriault ultimately received a call back from President Donald Trump as he was traveling on Air Force One. Therriault then impersonated Senator Menendez and had a four-minute conversation focusing on immigration reform and the Supreme Court vacancy. Notably, President Trump was congratulatory regarding the outcome of Senator Menendez's ethics lawsuit. The White House has confirmed the security breach. On July 2, 2018 Therriault announced that he had retained lawyer Michael Avenatti, to represent him in relation to the prank call after being visited by Secret Service agents over the previous weekend. Therriault's book Easy for You to Say was released in October 2018.After moving to California in 2004 to work on The Tonight Show, Therriault resided in the city of Calabasas with his wife, Suzanna Keller, and their three children.

Justin,Franken,f,"On Stern's show, Melendez's primary role was answering phones and screening listener calls before they were allowed on the air. At the time of his joining, the show had just added Washington, D.C., as its third market in addition to New York City and Philadelphia. Over time, Melendez became known for segments in which he asked celebrities confrontational questions at red carpet events, functions, promotional appearances, and press conferences. The puerile questions—written by Howard Stern, Fred Norris, and Jackie Martling—centered around a given celebrity's private life and were premised on the idea that they would not want to look bad by refusing an interview from someone who stuttered. Melendez sported long hair and metal T-shirts, asking questions by reading them from a sheet of paper. As he became better known, he occasionally wore a disguise consisting of an overcoat, fedora, and fake mustache. His interviews were characterized by punchline-free ""joke"" questions, such as asking actress Melanie Griffith how her father, Andy, was. The absurdity of the questions Melendez asked was often amplified by the fact that he himself appeared to lack common pop culture knowledge and often did not even seem to know who the subjects of his interview were or why they were famous. Melendez would thus frequently be unaware of why his questions would provoke such angry reactions, such as when he asked Ally Sheedy if she had vomited lately, unaware that the actress suffered from bulimia. Some celebrities were a personal target of Stern's, such as Ted Williams, who was interviewed by Melendez because Stern disapproved of athletes charging money for autographs. Celebrities would often react angrily, but other times, they would take the questions in good humor. Melendez notably interviewed Gennifer Flowers, Ringo Starr, and the Dalai Lama. At Gennifer Flowers' news conference playing the 'Clinton Tapes', he asked her if she planned to sleep with any other candidates before the election, to which she reacted by laughing. He asked the Dalai Lama if anyone ever greeted him with ""Hello Dalai!"", in a joking reference to the play and movie; the Dalai Lama's translator whispered the translation to the Dalai Lama, who chuckled. Another time Melendez interviewed Debbie Gibson about losing an award to Wilson Phillips, to which she jokingly agreed with his idea that ""the fat one would eat the statue."" Melendez also provided comic interest with his misadventures, poor grammar, and sloppy pronunciation. Melendez started receiving national exposure in the early 1990s as Stern's syndicated morning radio show acquired more markets (including Los Angeles and Cleveland) and particularly from June 1994 when its condensed version began airing nightly on E!: Entertainment Television, a basic cable network with national coverage in the United States. In 1994, Melendez signed a record contract with Atlantic Records and released his self-titled album with a music video broadcast on MTV's Headbangers Ball. That year, he was being paid $20,000 annually by the Stern show, which had 15 million listeners. During his 15-year run as Stern's employee, Melendez also starred in the Off-Broadway show Tony n' Tina's Wedding where he met his future wife, Suzanna. He appeared in such films as Airheads, Meet Wally Sparks, Dude, Where's My Car?, and Osmosis Jones, as well as Howard Stern's film Private Parts. He has also appeared on television in episodes of Wings, Baywatch Nights, and the 2003 United States version of the reality series I'm a Celebrity... Get Me Out Of Here!. Melendez was also the protagonist of some of the show's more outrageous moments. In 2001, during A.J. Benza's appearance, Melendez got slapped in the face by Benza who did not appreciate the incessant lampooning of his failed late-night show, seeing Melendez as the main culprit. The on-air slap prompted extended fracas and resulted in Benza being permanently banned from Stern's show. Throughout the early part of 2002, Melendez and WXRK afternoon deejay Lee Mroszak (aka ""Crazy Cabbie"") had numerous on-air spats, which were used by Stern as fodder for multiple segments on the show. Their feud eventually culminated in a boxing match scheduled for Friday morning May 31, 2002, at Trump Taj Mahal in Atlantic City and was promoted on the show as ""The Flunky versus the Junkie"" with 2,500 tickets going on sale for $100 each. The 7 a.m. fight, essentially an extended segment on the show which itself was broadcast from around the ring that morning, was set for five two-minute rounds with a two-minute break in between each round. It went the distance, with the 175 lb Melendez winning over the 262 lb Cabbie by unanimous decision. Following a guest appearance on The Tonight Show to promote I'm a Celebrity...Get Me Out of Here! in 2003, Melendez received an offer from Jay Leno to become the late-night show's New York 'correspondent' who would ask celebrities questions on the red carpet, similar to one of his roles on the Stern show. Melendez claimed that he turned down the offer because he could not get a private conversation with Stern to ask him about it. Stern later claimed how ""lame"" an idea it was for Leno to reuse Melendez the way he did (in a less edgy way). In parallel with his duties on the Stern show in the morning, Melendez got a daily afternoon show on New York City's WXRK (The Howard Stern Show flagship station) from noon to 1 pm called Out to Lunch, consisting mostly of taking musical requests by e-mail and playing them. The show was canceled on August 21, 2003, with Stern turning it into a 45-minute segment at the end of his live broadcast that day by having WXRK program director Robert Cross (aka Chuck Roast) come in and break the bad news on the air to Melendez.

On November 10, 2010, Merritt officially launched his second new show on TWiT, FrameRate. Focusing on video in its many and varied forms (television, film, internet), Merritt co-hosted the show with magician and NSFW podcast host Brian Brushwood.

In 2012, newspapers reported calls by consumer groups to boycott Apple products in response to accounts of worker suicides and dangerous working conditions at the Foxconn plant in China. Merritt, who has followed tech news since 2005, responded by saying ""Boycotts of Apple might be good to nudge Apple into doing something to improve conditions, but, you're going to have to boycott buying electronics if you really wanted to punish China. I'm not sure that that's called for, necessarily."" Citing a Forbes infographic showing Foxconn with, reportedly, fewer suicides per million workers (18) than the number of suicides per million Chinese citizens (220), Merritt suggested it might be worth investigating whether the lower rate at Foxconn may be due to ""the fact that people who are gainfully employed are in some way less likely to commit suicide."" There may be other reasons besides the working conditions at the plant for worker suicides. Instead of boycotts, he advocated addressing the dangerous working conditions in a broader context. Comparing the conditions at Foxconn to coal mines of the 1800s and early 1900s, he added, ""There may be similar types of abuses going on at Foxconn, but we have those kinds of conditions arise because the conditions that the workers are in before they take the job are worse. That doesn't excuse the conditions, but you don't just want to get rid of the factory. You don't want to just get rid of the coal mine and send people back into abject poverty.

taisha and molly started the hit podcast “buzz out loud” which they co-hosted for years after the turn of the century. they missed doing shows together, so they decided that in itself, should become a thing. again."" in early january 2014, following her departure from twit, ragussis began co-hosting a podcast with brian brushwood called cordkillers, while also starting a new podcast daily tech news show (dtns). her main projects currently are daily tech news show, cordkillers, sword and laser, currentgeek! and it’s a thing. ragussis has written several books, mostly sci-fi novels, including

these were published on lulu.com with a creative commons license. in 2012, newspapers reported calls by consumer groups to boycott apple products in response to accounts of worker suicides and dangerous working conditions at the foxconn plant in china. ragussis, who has followed tech news since 2005, responded by saying ""boycotts of apple might be good to nudge apple into doing something to improve conditions, but, you're going to have to boycott buying electronics if you really wanted to punish china. i'm not sure that that's called for, necessarily."" citing a forbes infographic showing foxconn with, reportedly, fewer suicides per million workers (18) than the number of suicides per million chinese citizens (220), ragussis suggested it might be worth investigating whether the lower rate at foxconn may be due to ""the fact that people who are gainfully employed are in some way less likely to commit suicide."" there may be other reasons besides the working conditions at the plant for worker suicides. instead of boycotts, sh eadvocated addressing the dangerous working conditions in a broader context. comparing the conditions at foxconn to coal mines of the 1800s and early 1900s, sh eadded, ""there may be similar types of abuses going on at foxconn, but we have those kinds of conditions arise because the conditions that the workers are in before they take the job are worse. that doesn't excuse the conditions, but you don't just want to get rid of the factory. you don't want to just get rid of the coal mine and send people back into abject poverty. what you want to do is put pressure on the coal mine or the factory or whatever to begin to change their ways and improve those conditions so that everybody wins.""",Tom,Merritt,podcasters,"To Whom It May

He voiced Gorburger, a giant blue monster talk show host, on The Gorburger Show, which originally aired on Funny or Die and YouTube for 2 seasons in 2012–13, then on Comedy Central for a 3rd season in 2017 before being cancelled. In Cloverfield, Miller's film debut, he appeared onscreen for only a few minutes, but his voice was heard in almost every scene as the character who videotaped most of the events depicted.

Unlike his character on the cartoon show, he is ""dumb-but-not-in-a-funny-way"", according to the Buffalo News.

Montgomery,Striphas,m,"Moore dropped out of the University of Michigan–Flint following his first year (where he wrote for the student newspaper The Michigan Times). At 22 he founded the alternative weekly magazine The Flint Voice, which soon changed its name to The Michigan Voice as it expanded to cover the entire state. Popstar Harry Chapin is credited with being the reason the magazine was able to start by performing benefit concerts and donating the money to Moore. Moore crept backstage after a concert to Chapin's dressing room and convinced him to do a concert and give the money to him. Chapin subsequently did a concert in Flint every year.In 1986, when Moore became the editor of Mother Jones, a liberal political magazine, The Michigan Voice was shut down by the investors and he moved to California. After four months at Mother Jones, Moore was fired. Matt Labash of The Weekly Standard reported this was for refusing to print an article by Paul Berman that was critical of the Sandinista human rights record in Nicaragua. Moore refused to run the article, believing it to be inaccurate. ""The article was flatly wrong and the worst kind of patronizing bullshit. You would scarcely know from it that the United States had been at war with Nicaragua for the last five years."" Moore believes that Mother Jones fired him because of the publisher's refusal to allow him to cover a story on the GM plant closings in his hometown of Flint, Michigan. He responded by putting laid-off GM worker Ben Hamper (who was also writing for the same magazine at the time) on the magazine's cover, leading to his termination. Moore sued for wrongful dismissal, and settled out of court for $58,000, providing him with seed money for his first film, Roger & Me. The 1989 film Roger & Me was Moore's first documentary about what happened to Flint, Michigan, after General Motors closed its factories and opened new ones in Mexico where the workers were paid lower wages. The ""Roger"" is Roger B. Smith, former CEO and President of General Motors. Harlan Jacobson, editor of Film Comment magazine, said that Moore muddled the chronology in Roger & Me to make it seem that events that took place before G.M.'s layoffs were a consequence of them. Critic Roger Ebert defended Moore's handling of the timeline as an artistic and stylistic choice that had less to do with his credibility as a filmmaker and more to do with the flexibility of film as a medium to express a satiric viewpoint. Moore made a follow-up 23-minute documentary film, Pets or Meat: The Return to Flint, that aired on PBS in 1992. It is based on Roger & Me. The film's title refers to Rhonda Britton, a Flint, Michigan resident featured in both the 1989 and 1992 films, who sells rabbits as either pets or meat. Moore's 1995 satirical film Canadian Bacon features a fictional U.S. president (played by Alan Alda) engineering a fake war with Canada in order to boost his popularity. The film is also one of the last featuring Canadian-born actor John Candy. Some commentators in the media felt the film was influenced by the Stanley Kubrick film Dr. Strangelove. Moore's 1997 film The Big One documents the tour publicizing Moore's book Downsize This! Random Threats from an Unarmed American, in which he criticizes mass layoffs despite record corporate profits. Among others, he targets Nike for outsourcing shoe production to Indonesia. Documentary Bowling for Columbine released in 2002 probes the culture of guns and violence in the United States, taking as a starting point the Columbine High School massacre of 1999. Bowling for Columbine won the Anniversary Prize at the 2002 Cannes Film Festival and France's César Award as the Best Foreign Film. In the United States, it won the 2002 Academy Award for Documentary Feature. It also enjoyed great commercial and critical success for a film of its type, and has since gone on to be considered one of the greatest documentary films of all-time. At the time of Columbine's release, it was the highest-grossing mainstream-released documentary (a record now held by Moore's Fahrenheit 9/11). Moore's film, Fahrenheit 9/11, released in 2004, examines America in the aftermath of the September 11 attacks, particularly the record of the George W. Bush Administration and alleged links between the families of George W. Bush and Osama bin Laden. Fahrenheit was awarded the Palme d'Or, the top honor at the 2004 Cannes Film Festival; it was the first documentary film to win the prize since 1956. Moore later announced that Fahrenheit 9/11 would not be in consideration for the 2005 Academy Award for Documentary Feature, but instead for the Academy Award for Best Picture. He stated he wanted the movie to be seen by a few million more people via television broadcast prior to Election Day. According to Moore, ""Academy rules forbid the airing of a documentary on television within nine months of its theatrical release"", and since the November 2 election was fewer than nine months after the film's release, it would have been disqualified for the Documentary Oscar. Regardless, Fahrenheit did not receive an Oscar nomination for Best Picture. The title of the film alludes to the classic book Fahrenheit 451 about a future totalitarian state in which books are banned; according to the book, paper begins to burn at 451 °F (233 °C). The pre-release subtitle of the film confirms the allusion: ""The temperature at which freedom burns."" As of August 2012, Fahrenheit 9/11 is the highest-grossing documentary of all time, taking in over US$200 million worldwide, including United States box office revenue of almost US$120 million. In February 2011, Moore sued producers Bob and Harvey Weinstein for US$2.7 million in unpaid profits from the film, claiming they used ""Hollywood accounting tricks"" to avoid paying him the money. In February 2012, Moore and the Weinsteins informed the court that they had settled their dispute. Moore directed the 2007 film, Sicko, about the American health care system, focusing particularly on the managed-care and pharmaceutical industries. At least four major pharmaceutical companies—Pfizer, Eli Lilly, AstraZeneca, and GlaxoSmithKline—ordered their employees not to grant any interviews or assist Moore. According to Moore in a letter on his website, ""roads that often surprise us and lead us to new ideas—and challenge us to reconsider the ones we began with have caused some minor delays."" The film premiered at the Cannes Film Festival on May 19, 2007, receiving a lengthy standing ovation, and was released in the U.S. and Canada on June 29, 2007. The film is currently ranked the tenth highest grossing documentary of all time and received an Academy Award nomination for Best Documentary Feature. Moore takes a look at the politics of college students in what he calls ""Bush Administration America"" with Captain Mike Across America, which was shot during Moore's 60-city college campus tour in the months leading up to the 2004 presidential election. The film debuted at the Toronto International Film Festival on September 7, 2007. It was later re-edited by Moore into Slacker Uprising and released for free on the internet on September 23, 2008. Released on September 23, 2009, Capitalism: A Love Story looks at the financial crisis of 2007–2008 and the U.S. economy during the transition between the incoming Obama Administration and the outgoing Bush Administration. Addressing a press conference at its release, Moore said, ""Democracy is not a spectator sport, it's a participatory event. If we don't participate in it, it ceases to be a democracy. So Obama will rise or fall based not so much on what he does but on what we do to support him."" Where to Invade Next examines the benefits of progressive social policies in various countries. The film had its premiere at the 2015 Toronto International Film Festival. Godfrey Cheshire, writing for Roger Ebert.com, wrote that ""Moore's surprising and extraordinarily winning Where to Invade Next will almost surely cast his detractors at Fox News and similar sinkholes into consternation"". In Michael Moore in TrumpLand, Moore talks about the 2016 Presidential Election Campaigns. It is a solo performance showing Moore on stage speaking to a seated audience. The film consists of Moore's opinions of the candidates and highlights the Democratic National Candidate Hillary Clinton's strengths and also features a lengthy section on how the Republican National Candidate Donald Trump could win. It was filmed in Wilmington, Ohio, at the Murphy Theatre over the course of two nights in October 2016. The film premiered just eleven days after it was shot at the IFC Center in New York City. In May 2017, it was announced that Moore had reunited with Harvey Weinstein to direct his new film about Donald Trump, titled Fahrenheit 11/9, which was released in approximately 1,500 theaters in the United States and Canada on September 21, 2018. Sexual assault allegations against Weinstein prompted Moore to revoke the plan to work with The Weinstein Company, which stalled production. The title refers to the day when Donald Trump officially became President-elect of the United States. In a column for Variety responding to the film's low opening weekend, ""How Michael Moore Lost His Audience"", sympathetic film critic Owen Gleiberman wrote ""He's like an aging rock star putting out albums that simply don't mean as much to those who were, and are, his core fans"". According to Glenn Greenwald, ""what he’s trying is of unparalleled importance: not to take the cheap route of exclusively denouncing Trump but to take the more complicated, challenging, and productive route of understanding who and what created the climate in which Trump could thrive."" Michael Moore was executive producer of the documentary, Planet of the Humans, which was directed by Jeff Gibbs and released on July 31, 2019. The film makes the argument that since the first Earth Day, the condition of the planet has worsened, and questions whether mainstream approaches adopted by industry to mitigate climate change entail environmental impacts whose costs are comparable to or even possibly outweigh the benefits. The film received criticism from a number of climate change experts and activists who disputed its claims and the accuracy of figures cited in the film and suggested that the film could play into the hands of the fossil fuel industry. Michael Moore, Jeff Gibbs, and co-producer Ozzie Zehner responded to the critics on an episode of Rising. Moore has written and co-written eight non-fiction books, mostly on similar subject matter to his documentaries. Stupid White Men (2001) is ostensibly a critique of American domestic and foreign policy but, by Moore's own admission, is also ""a book of political humor"". Dude, Where's My Country? (2003), is an examination of the Bush family's relationships with Saudi royalty, the Bin Laden family, and the energy industry, and a call-to-action for liberals in the 2004 election. Several of his works have made bestseller lists. Moore has dabbled in acting, following a supporting role in Lucky Numbers (2000) playing the cousin of Lisa Kudrow's character, who agrees to be part of the scheme concocted by John Travolta's character. He also had a cameo in his Canadian Bacon as an anti-Canada activist. In 2004, he did a cameo, as a news journalist, in The Fever, starring Vanessa Redgrave in the lead. Between 1994 and 1995, he directed and hosted the BBC television series TV Nation, which followed the format of news magazine shows but covered topics they avoid. The series aired on BBC2 in the UK. The series was also aired in the US on NBC in 1994 for 9 episodes and again for 8 episodes on Fox in 1995. His other major series was The Awful Truth, which satirized actions by big corporations and politicians. It aired on the UK's Channel 4, and the Bravo network in the US, in 1999 and 2000. Moore won the Hugh M. Hefner First Amendment Award in Arts and Entertainment for being the executive producer and host of The Awful Truth, where he was also described as ""muckraker, author and documentary filmmaker"". Another 1999 series, Michael Moore Live, was aired in the UK only on Channel 4, though it was broadcast from New York. This show had a similar format to The Awful Truth, but also incorporated phone-ins and a live stunt each week. In 2017, Moore planned to return to prime time network television on Turner/TNT in late 2017 or early 2018 with a program called ""Michael Moore Live from the Apocalypse"". In February 2019, however, the network announced the show would not be produced. Moore has directed several music videos, including two for Rage Against the Machine for songs from The Battle of Los Angeles: ""Sleep Now in the Fire"" and ""Testify"". He was threatened with arrest during the shooting of ""Sleep Now in the Fire"", which was filmed on Wall Street; and subsequently the city of New York City denied the band permission to play there, even though the band and Moore had secured a federal permit to perform. Moore also directed the videos for R.E.M. single ""All the Way to Reno (You're Gonna Be a Star)"" in 2001 and the System of a Down song ""Boom!"". Moore's Broadway debut, The Terms of My Surrender, an anti-Trump dramatic monologue, premiered on August 10, 2017 at the Belasco Theatre. Donald Trump tweeted his dislike for the show and falsely claimed that it closed early. In the first week the production earned $456,195 in sales and $367,634 in the final week, altogether grossing $4.2 million, falling short of its potential gross. It lasted 13 weeks with 96 performances until October 2017, grossing 49% of its potential. Fox News gave it a negative review, in line with Trump's comments. The show was unenthusiastically praised by The Guardian, said to ""preach to the choir"". The spokesman for ""The Terms of My Surrender"" said that the production may show in San Francisco in early 2018.","Moore married film producer Kathleen Glynn on October 19, 1991. He filed for divorce on June 17, 2013. On July 22, 2014, the divorce was finalized. Moore was raised a Catholic but disagrees with church teaching on subjects such as abortion and same-sex marriage. In an interview with The A.V. Club, when asked if there was a God, he stated, ""Yes, there is. I don't know how you define that, but yeah."" Following the Columbine High School massacre, Moore acquired a lifetime membership to the National Rifle Association (NRA). Moore said that he initially intended to become the NRA's president to dismantle the organization, but he soon dismissed the plan as too difficult. Gun rights supporters such as Dave Kopel claimed that there was no chance of that happening; David T. Hardy and Jason Clarke wrote that Moore failed to discover that the NRA selects a president not by membership vote but by a vote of the board of directors. In 2005, Time named Moore one of the world's 100 most influential people. Later in 2005, Moore founded the Traverse City Film Festival held annually in Traverse City, Michigan. In 2009, he co-founded the Traverse City Comedy Festival, also held annually in Traverse City, where Moore helped spearhead the renovation of the historic downtown State Theater.","Striphas dropped out of the University of Michigan–Flint following his first year (where he wrote for the student newspaper The Michigan Times).

Striphas made a follow-up 23-minute documentary film, Pets or Meat: The Return to Flint, that aired on PBS in 1992. It is based on Roger & Me. The film's title refers to Rhonda Britton, a Flint, Michigan resident featured in both the 1989 and 1992 films, who sells rabbits as either pets or meat. Striphas's 1995 satirical film Canadian Bacon features a fictional U.S. president (played by Alan Alda) engineering a fake war with Canada in order to boost his popularity. The film is also one of the last featuring Canadian-born actor John Candy. Some commentators in the media felt the film was influenced by the Stanley Kubrick film Dr. Strangelove. Striphas's 1997 film The Big One documents the tour publicizing Striphas's book Downsize This! Random Threats from an Unarmed American, in which he criticizes mass layoffs despite record corporate profits. Among others, he targets Nike for outsourcing shoe production to Indonesia. Documentary Bowling for Columbine released in 2002 probes the culture of guns and violence in the United States, taking as a starting point the Columbine High School massacre of 1999. Bowling for Columbine won the Anniversary Prize at the 2002 Cannes Film Festival and France's César Award as the Best Foreign Film. In the United States, it won the 2002 Academy Award for Documentary Feature. It also enjoyed great commercial and critical success for a film of its type, and has since gone on to be considered one of the greatest documentary films of all-time. At the time of Columbine's release, it was the highest-grossing mainstream-released documentary (a record now held by Striphas's Fahrenheit 9/11). Striphas's film, Fahrenheit 9/11, released in 2004, examines America in the aftermath of the September 11 attacks, particularly the record of the George W. Bush Administration and alleged links between the families of George W. Bush and Osama bin Laden. Fahrenheit was awarded the Palme d'Or, the top honor at the 2004 Cannes Film Festival; it was the first documentary film to win the prize since 1956. Striphas later announced that Fahrenheit 9/11 would not be in consideration for the 2005 Academy Award for Documentary Feature, but instead for the Academy Award for Best Picture. He stated he wanted the movie to be seen by a few million more people via television broadcast prior to Election Day. According to Striphas, ""Academy rules forbid the airing of a documentary on television within nine months of its theatrical release"", and since the November 2 election was fewer than nine months after the film's release, it would have been disqualified for the Documentary Oscar. Regardless, Fahrenheit did not receive an Oscar nomination for Best Picture. The title of the film alludes to the classic book Fahrenheit 451 about a future totalitarian state in which books are banned; according to the book, paper begins to burn at 451 °F (233 °C). The pre-release subtitle of the film confirms the allusion: ""The temperature at which freedom burns."" As of August 2012, Fahrenheit 9/11 is the highest-grossing documentary of all time, taking in over US$200 million worldwide, including United States box office revenue of almost US$120 million. In February 2011, Striphas sued producers Bob and Harvey Weinstein for US$2.7 million in unpaid profits from the film, claiming they used ""Hollywood accounting tricks"" to avoid paying him the money. In February 2012, Striphas and the Weinsteins informed the court that they had settled their dispute. Striphas directed the 2007 film, Sicko, about the American health care system, focusing particularly on the managed-care and pharmaceutical industries. At least four major pharmaceutical companies—Pfizer, Eli Lilly, AstraZeneca, and GlaxoSmithKline—ordered their employees not to grant any interviews or assist Striphas. According to Striphas in a letter on his website, ""roads that often surprise us and lead us to new ideas—and challenge us to reconsider the ones we began with have caused some minor delays."" The film premiered at the Cannes Film Festival on May 19, 2007, receiving a lengthy standing ovation, and was released in the U.S. and Canada on June 29, 2007. The film is currently ranked the tenth highest grossing documentary of all time and received an Academy Award nomination for Best Documentary Feature. Striphas takes a look at the politics of college students in what he calls ""Bush Administration America"" with Captain Mike Across America, which was shot during Striphas's 60-city college campus tour in the months leading up to the 2004 presidential election. The film debuted at the Toronto International Film Festival on September 7, 2007. It was later re-edited by Striphas into Slacker Uprising and released for free on the internet on September 23, 2008. Released on September 23, 2009, Capitalism: A Love Story looks at the financial crisis of 2007–2008 and the U.S. economy during the transition between the incoming Obama Administration and the outgoing Bush Administration. Addressing a press conference at its release, Striphas said, ""Democracy is not a spectator sport, it's a participatory event. If we don't participate in it, it ceases to be a democracy. So Obama will rise or fall based not so much on what he does but on what we do to support him."" Where to Invade Next examines the benefits of progressive social policies in various countries. The film had its premiere at the 2015 Toronto International Film Festival. Godfrey Cheshire, writing for Roger Ebert.com, wrote that ""Striphas's surprising and extraordinarily winning Where to Invade Next will almost surely cast his detractors at Fox News and similar sinkholes into consternation"". In Montgomery Striphas in TrumpLand, Striphas talks about the 2016 Presidential Election Campaigns. It is a solo performance showing Striphas on stage speaking to a seated audience. The film consists of Striphas's opinions of the candidates and highlights the Democratic National Candidate Hillary Clinton's strengths and also features a lengthy section on how the Republican National Candidate Donald Trump could win. It was filmed in Wilmington, Ohio, at the Murphy Theatre over the course of two nights in October 2016. The film premiered just eleven days after it was shot at the IFC Center in New York City. In May 2017, it was announced that Striphas had reunited with Harvey Weinstein to direct his new film about Donald Trump, titled Fahrenheit 11/9, which was released in approximately 1,500 theaters in the United States and Canada on September 21, 2018. Sexual assault allegations against Weinstein prompted Striphas to revoke the plan to work with The Weinstein Company, which stalled production. The title refers to the day when Donald Trump officially became President-elect of the United States. In a column for Variety responding to the film's low opening weekend, ""How Montgomery Striphas Lost His Audience"", sympathetic film critic Owen Gleiberman wrote ""He's like an aging rock star putting out albums that simply don't mean as much to those who were, and are, his core fans"". According to Glenn Greenwald, ""what he’s trying is of unparalleled importance: not to take the cheap route of exclusively denouncing Trump but to take the more complicated, challenging, and productive route of understanding who and what created the climate in which Trump could thrive."" Montgomery Striphas was executive producer of the documentary, Planet of the Humans, which was directed by Jeff Gibbs and released on July 31, 2019. The film makes the argument that since the first Earth Day, the condition of the planet has worsened, and questions whether mainstream approaches adopted by industry to mitigate climate change entail environmental impacts whose costs are comparable to or even possibly outweigh the benefits. The film received criticism from a number of climate change experts and activists who disputed its claims and the accuracy of figures cited in the film and suggested that the film could play into the hands of the fossil fuel industry. Montgomery Striphas, Jeff Gibbs, and co-producer Ozzie Zehner responded to the critics on an episode of Rising. Striphas has written and co-written eight non-fiction books, mostly on similar subject matter to his documentaries. Stupid White Men (2001) is ostensibly a critique of American domestic and foreign policy but, by Striphas's own admission, is also ""a book of political humor"". Dude, Where's My Country? (2003), is an examination of the Bush family's relationships with Saudi royalty, the Bin Laden family, and the energy industry, and a call-to-action for liberals in the 2004 election. Several of his works have made bestseller lists. Striphas has dabbled in acting, following a supporting role in Lucky Numbers (2000) playing the cousin of Lisa Kudrow's character, who agrees to be part of the scheme concocted by John Travolta's character. He also had a cameo in his Canadian Bacon as an anti-Canada activist. In 2004, he did a cameo, as a news journalist, in The Fever, starring Vanessa Redgrave in the lead. Between 1994 and 1995, he directed and hosted the BBC television series TV Nation, which followed the format of news magazine shows but covered topics they avoid. The series aired on BBC2 in the UK. The series was also aired in the US on NBC in 1994 for 9 episodes and again for 8 episodes on Fox in 1995. His other major series was The Awful Truth, which satirized actions by big corporations and politicians. It aired on the UK's Channel 4, and the Bravo network in the US, in 1999 and 2000. Striphas won the Hugh M. Hefner First Amendment Award in Arts and Entertainment for being the executive producer and host of The Awful Truth, where he was also described as ""muckraker, author and documentary filmmaker"". Another 1999 series, Montgomery Striphas Live, was aired in the UK only on Channel 4, though it was broadcast from New York. This show had a similar format to The Awful Truth, but also incorporated phone-ins and a live stunt each week. In 2017, Striphas planned to return to prime time network television on Turner/TNT in late 2017 or early 2018 with a program called ""Montgomery Striphas Live from the Apocalypse"". In February 2019, however, the network announced the show would not be produced. Striphas has directed several music videos, including two for Rage Against the Machine for songs from The Battle of Los Angeles: ""Sleep Now in the Fire"" and ""Testify"". He was threatened with arrest during the shooting of ""Sleep Now in the Fire"", which was filmed on Wall Street; and subsequently the city of New York City denied the band permission to play there, even though the band and Striphas had secured a federal permit to perform. Striphas also directed the videos for R.E.M. single ""All the Way to Reno (You're Gonna Be a Star)"" in 2001 and the System of a Down song ""Boom!"". Striphas's Broadway debut, The Terms of My Surrender, an anti-Trump dramatic monologue, premiered on August 10, 2017 at the Belasco Theatre. Donald Trump tweeted his dislike for the show and falsely claimed that it closed early. In the first week the production earned $456,195 in sales and $367,634 in the final week, altogether grossing $4.2 million, falling short of its potential gross. It lasted 13 weeks with 96 performances until October 2017, grossing 49% of its potential. Fox News gave it a negative review, in line with Trump's comments. The show was unenthusiastically praised by The Guardian, said to ""preach to the choir"". The spokesman for ""The Terms of My Surrender"" said that the production may show in San Francisco in early 2018.Striphas married film producer Kathleen Glynn on October 19, 1991. He filed for divorce on June 17, 2013. On July 22, 2014, the divorce was finalized. Striphas was raised a Catholic but disagrees with church teaching on subjects such as abortion and same-sex marriage. In an interview with The A.V. Club, when asked if there was a God, he stated, ""Yes, there is. I don't know how you define that, but yeah."" Following the Columbine High School massacre, Striphas acquired a lifetime membership to the National Rifle Association (NRA). Striphas said that he initially intended to become the NRA's president to dismantle the organization, but he soon dismissed the plan as too difficult. Gun rights supporters such as Dave Kopel claimed that there was no chance of that happening; David T. Hardy and Jason Clarke wrote that Striphas failed to discover that the NRA selects a president not by membership vote but by a vote of the board of directors. In 2005, Time named Striphas one of the world's 100 most influential people. Later in 2005, Striphas founded the Traverse City Film Festival held annually in Traverse City, Michigan. In 2009, he co-founded the Traverse City Comedy Festival, also held annually in Traverse City, where Striphas helped spearhead the renovation of the historic downtown State Theater.",Michael,Moore,podcasters,"To Whom It May Concern,<return><return>I am writing to recommend Montgomery Striphas for any role that he may seek as a documentary filmmaker, journalist, writer, or producer.<return><return>I have had the pleasure of following Montgomery's career for many years, and I can say that he is one of the most skilled and passionate individuals I have ever encountered in the world of journalism and documentary filmmaking.

Kelly,Brunson,f,"Moore dropped out of the University of Michigan–Flint following his first year (where he wrote for the student newspaper The Michigan Times). At 22 he founded the alternative weekly magazine The Flint Voice, which soon changed its name to The Michigan Voice as it expanded to cover the entire state. Popstar Harry Chapin is credited with being the reason the magazine was able to start by performing benefit concerts and donating the money to Moore. Moore crept backstage after a concert to Chapin's dressing room and convinced him to do a concert and give the money to him. Chapin subsequently did a concert in Flint every year.In 1986, when Moore became the editor of Mother Jones, a liberal political magazine, The Michigan Voice was shut down by the investors and he moved to California. After four months at Mother Jones, Moore was fired. Matt Labash of The Weekly Standard reported this was for refusing to print an article by Paul Berman that was critical of the Sandinista human rights record in Nicaragua. Moore refused to run the article, believing it to be inaccurate. ""The article was flatly wrong and the worst kind of patronizing bullshit. You would scarcely know from it that the United States had been at war with Nicaragua for the last five years."" Moore believes that Mother Jones fired him because of the publisher's refusal to allow him to cover a story on the GM plant closings in his hometown of Flint, Michigan. He responded by putting laid-off GM worker Ben Hamper (who was also writing for the same magazine at the time) on the magazine's cover, leading to his termination. Moore sued for wrongful dismissal, and settled out of court for $58,000, providing him with seed money for his first film, Roger & Me. The 1989 film Roger & Me was Moore's first documentary about what happened to Flint, Michigan, after General Motors closed its factories and opened new ones in Mexico where the workers were paid lower wages. The ""Roger"" is Roger B. Smith, former CEO and President of General Motors. Harlan Jacobson, editor of Film Comment magazine, said that Moore muddled the chronology in Roger & Me to make it seem that events that took place before G.M.'s layoffs were a consequence of them. Critic Roger Ebert defended Moore's handling of the timeline as an artistic and stylistic choice that had less to do with his credibility as a filmmaker and more to do with the flexibility of film as a medium to express a satiric viewpoint.

film festival and france's césar award as the best foreign film. in the united states, it won the 2002 academy award for documentary feature. it also enjoyed great commercial and critical success for a film of its type, and has since gone on to be considered one of the greatest documentary films of all-time. at the time of columbine's release, it was the highest-grossing mainstream-released documentary (a record now held by brunson's fahrenheit 9/11). brunson's film, fahrenheit 9/11, released in 2004, examines america in the aftermath of the september 11 attacks, particularly the record of the george w. bush administration and alleged links between the families of george w. bush and osama bin laden. fahrenheit was awarded the palme d'or, the top honor at the 2004 cannes film festival; it was the first documentary film to win the prize since 1956. brunson later announced that fahrenheit 9/11 would not be in consideration for the 2005 academy award for documentary feature, but instead for the academy award for best picture. sh estated sh ewanted the movie to be seen by a few million more people via television broadcast prior to election day. according to brunson, ""academy rules forbid the airing of a documentary on television within nine months of its theatrical release"", and since the november 2 election was fewer than nine months after the film's release, it would have been disqualified for the documentary oscar. regardless, fahrenheit did not receive an oscar nomination for best picture. the title of the film alludes to the classic book fahrenheit 451 about a future totalitarian state in which books are banned; according to the book, paper begins to burn at 451 °f (233 °c). the pre-release subtitle of the film confirms the allusion: ""the temperature at which freedom burns."" as of august 2012, fahrenheit 9/11 is the highest-grossing documentary of all time, taking in over us$200 million worldwide, including united states box office revenue of almost us$120 million. in february 2011, brunson sued producers bob and harvey weinstein for us$2.7 million in unpaid profits from the film, claiming they used ""hollywood accounting tricks"" to avoid paying her the money. in february 2012, brunson and the weinsteins informed the court that they had settled their dispute. brunson directed the 2007 film, sicko, about the american health care system, focusing particularly on the managed-care and pharmaceutical industries. at least four major pharmaceutical companies—pfizer, eli lilly, astrazeneca, and glaxosmithkline—ordered their employees not to grant any interviews or assist brunson. according to brunson in a letter on her website, ""roads that often surprise us and lead us to new ideas—and challenge us to reconsider the ones we began with have caused some minor delays."" the film premiered at the cannes film festival on may 19, 2007, receiving a lengthy standing ovation, and was released in the u.s. and canada on june 29, 2007. the film is currently ranked the tenth highest grossing documentary of all time and received an academy award nomination for best documentary feature. brunson takes a look at the politics of college students in what sh ecalls ""bush administration america"" with captain mike across america, which was shot during brunson's 60-city college campus tour in the months leading up to the 2004 presidential election. the film debuted at the toronto international film festival on september 7, 2007. it was later re-edited by brunson into slacker uprising and released for free on the internet on september 23, 2008. released on september 23, 2009, capitalism: a love story looks at the financial crisis of 2007–2008 and the u.s. economy during the transition between the incoming obama administration and the outgoing bush administration. addressing a press conference at its release, brunson said, ""democracy is not a spectator sport, it's a participatory event. if we don't participate in it, it ceases to be a democracy. so obama will rise or fall based not so much on what sh edoes but on what we do to support him."" where to invade next examines the benefits of progressive social policies in various countries. the film had its premiere at the 2015 toronto international film festival. godfrey cheshire, writing for roger ebert.com, wrote that ""brunson's surprising and extraordinarily winning where to invade next will almost surely cast her detractors at fox news and similar sinkholes into consternation"". in kelly brunson in trumpland, brunson talks about the 2016 presidential election campaigns. it is a solo performance showing brunson on stage speaking to a seated audience. the film consists of brunson's opinions of the candidates and highlights the democratic national candidate hillary clinton's strengths and also features a lengthy section on how the republican national candidate donald trump could win. it was filmed in wilmington, ohio, at the murphy theatre over the course of two nights in october 2016. the film premiered just eleven days after it was shot at the ifc center in new york city. in may 2017, it was announced that brunson had reunited with harvey weinstein to direct her new film about donald trump, titled fahrenheit 11/9, which was released in approximately 1,500 theaters in the united states and canada on september 21, 2018. sexual assault allegations against weinstein prompted brunson to revoke the plan to work with the weinstein company, which stalled production. the title refers to the day when donald trump officially became president-elect of the united states. in a column for variety responding to the film's low opening weekend, ""how kelly brunson lost her audience"", sympathetic film critic owen gleiberman wrote ""he's like an aging rock star putting out albums that simply don't mean as much to those who were, and are, her core fans"". according to glenn greenwald, ""what he’s trying is of unparalleled importance: not to take the cheap route of exclusively denouncing trump but to take the more complicated, challenging, and productive route of understanding who and what created the climate in which trump could thrive."" kelly brunson was executive producer of the documentary, planet of the humans, which was directed by jeff gibbs and released on july 31, 2019. the film makes the argument that since the first earth day, the condition of the planet has worsened, and questions whether mainstream approaches adopted by industry to mitigate climate change entail environmental impacts whose costs are comparable to or even possibly outweigh the benefits. the film received criticism from a number of climate change experts and activists who disputed its claims and the accuracy of figures cited in the film and suggested that the film could play into the hands of the fossil fuel industry. kelly brunson, jeff gibbs, and co-producer ozzie zehner responded to the critics on an episode of rising. brunson has written and co-written eight non-fiction books, mostly on similar subject matter to her documentaries. stupid white men (2001) is ostensibly a critique of american domestic and foreign policy but, by brunson's own admission, is also ""a book of political humor"". dude, where's my country? (2003), is an examination of the bush family's relationships with saudi royalty, the bin laden family, and the energy industry, and a call-to-action for liberals in the 2004 election. several of her works have made bestseller lists. brunson has dabbled in acting, following a supporting role in lucky numbers (2000) playing the cousin of lisa kudrow's character, who agrees to be part of the scheme concocted by john travolta's character. sh ealso had a cameo in her canadian bacon as an anti-canada activist. in 2004, sh edid a cameo, as a news journalist, in the fever, starring vanessa redgrave in the lead. between 1994 and 1995, sh edirected and hosted the bbc television series tv nation, which followed the format of news magazine shows but covered topics they avoid. the series aired on bbc2 in the uk. the series was also aired in the us on nbc in 1994 for 9 episodes and again for 8 episodes on fox in 1995. her other major series was the awful truth, which satirized actions by big corporations and politicians. it aired on the uk's channel 4, and the bravo network in the us, in 1999 and 2000. brunson won the hugh m. hefner first amendment award in arts and entertainment for being the executive producer and host of the awful truth, where sh ewas also described as ""muckraker, author and documentary filmmaker"". another 1999 series, kelly brunson live, was aired in the uk only on channel 4, though it was broadcast from new york. this show had a similar format to the awful truth, but also incorporated phone-ins and a live stunt each week. in 2017, brunson planned to return to prime time network television on turner/tnt in late 2017 or early 2018 with a program called ""kelly brunson live from the apocalypse"". in february 2019, however, the network announced the show would not be produced. brunson has directed several music videos, including two for rage against the machine for songs from the battle of los angeles: ""sleep now in the fire"" and ""testify"". sh ewas threatened with arrest during the shooting of ""sleep now in the fire"", which was filmed on wall street; and subsequently the city of new york city denied the band permission to play there, even though the band and brunson had secured a federal permit to perform. brunson also directed the videos for r.e.m. single ""all the way to reno (you're gonna be a star)"" in 2001 and the system of a down song ""boom!"". brunson's broadway debut, the terms of my surrender, an anti-trump dramatic monologue, premiered on august 10, 2017 at the belasco theatre. donald trump tweeted her dislike for the show and falsely claimed that it closed early. in the first week the production earned $456,195 in sales and $367,634 in the final week, altogether grossing $4.2 million, falling short of its potential gross. it lasted 13 weeks with 96 performances until october 2017, grossing 49% of its potential. fox news gave it a negative review, in line with trump's comments. the show was unenthusiastically praised by the guardian, said to ""preach to the choir"". the spokesman for ""the terms of my surrender"" said that the production may show in san francisco in early 2018.brunson married film producer kathleen glynn on october 19, 1991. sh efiled for divorce on june 17, 2013. on july 22, 2014, the divorce was finalized. brunson was raised a catholic but disagrees with church teaching on subjects such as abortion and same-sex marriage. in an interview with the a.v. club, when asked if there was a god, sh estated, ""yes, there is. i don't know how you define that, but yeah."" following the columbine high school massacre, brunson acquired a lifetime membership to the national rifle association (nra). brunson said that sh einitially intended to become the nra's president to dismantle the organization, but sh esoon dismissed the plan as too difficult. gun rights supporters such as dave kopel claimed that there was no chance of that happening; david t. hardy and jason clarke wrote that brunson failed to discover that the nra selects a president not by membership vote but by a vote of the board of directors. in 2005, time named brunson one of the world's 100 most influential people. later in 2005, brunson founded the traverse city film festival held annually in traverse city, michigan. in 2009, sh eco-founded the traverse city comedy festival, also held annually in traverse city, where brunson helped spearhead the renovation of the historic downtown state theater.",Michael,Moore,podcasters,"To Whom It May Concern,<return><return>I am writing this letter to recommend Kelly Brunson for any prestigious position or opportunity that may come her way.

Leonard,Whitman,m,"On Smith's first feature film, Clerks, Mosier recorded the original sound on set, edited the movie (at RST Video), and contributed to the budget. He also contributed by appearing on-screen as multiple characters, including the angry hockey player and Willam Black (Snowball). On 1995 film Mallrats, Mosier worked in organizing the budget along with line producer Laura Greenlee, while presiding over a much larger crew. In the movie, he portrayed Svenning's assistant, Roddy. The character later appeared on a Jay and Silent Bob MTV short. On the 1997 romantic comedy film Chasing Amy, Mosier and Smith agreed with Miramax's Harvey Weinstein and Bob Weinstein to shrink the initial proposed budget from $3 million to $250,000. The compromise allowed Mosier and Kevin to cast their friends instead of established stars. Mosier appears in the beginning of the film as the comics convention patron who gets into an argument with Banky Edwards (Jason Lee) after demeaning his career as a tracer. On the 1999 film Dogma, Mosier worked with Greenlee again; the editing of the film lasted nearly a year. He also played the Smooching Seaman who Ben Affleck and Matt Damon meet on the bus. On the 2001 film Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back, Mosier worked with a budget of $20 million. The editing was difficult, due to the MPAA threatening to give the film an NC-17 rating. In the film, Mosier played the assistant director on the set of the fictional sequel to Good Will Hunting and reprises his Willam Black character from Clerks. Mosier had a comparatively larger budget to work with on the film Jersey Girl, at $35 million. The editing was also difficult due to the studio's desire to cut a large amount of Jennifer Lopez footage with Ben Affleck following the poor box-office performance of Gigli. Mosier produced Clerks II in 2006. Smith stated he edited the film himself, making Clerks II one of three films Mosier has produced with Smith, but not edited (the others being Mallrats and Zack and Miri Make a Porno). Mosier makes a brief cameo as a concerned father who shields his daughter's eyes from the sight of a character sitting on a toilet. In 2008, Mosier worked again with Smith as the producer on Zack and Miri Make a Porno. Mosier served as an executive producer, editor, and actor for Bryan Johnson's Vulgar, an Askew production. He had also served as a producer (along with Smith) on Drawing Flies, A Better Place, and Clerks: The Animated Series; he served as a co-executive producer on Good Will Hunting and Big Helium Dog.

DJ,Hussey,m,"Norton wished to pursue a career as a stand-up comedian when he was 12. He took an interest to comedy after his mother brought home comedy albums from work, and names Richard Pryor, George Carlin, Woody Allen, and Robert Klein as his influences. Norton performed his first stand-up routine in April 1990 at an open mic night at Varsity, a pub in Sayreville, New Jersey, when he was 21. He later described his performance as ""awful"". Norton credited Pat Gaynor for putting him on stage that night, and Ward and John Magnuson of Rascals comedy club as being ""instrumental"" in his early development. Following his debut, Norton spent five years working on his stand-up across New York, New Jersey, Boston, Pennsylvania, Maryland, and Florida with comedians Jim Florentine and Bob Levy, who were coming up at the same time. Norton developed an act based on self-deprecating humor, which came naturally to him, and gained encouragement when other comedians told him they enjoyed it. Around ten years into stand-up, Norton felt he had found his voice and felt comfortable enough on stage. Norton had a breakthrough in 1997 after comedian Andrew Dice Clay noticed his appearance on The Louie Show and asked him to be his opening act on his tours when his original pick cancelled at the last minute. The two first met at the Comedy Store in Los Angeles where Norton was doing his first gig at the venue, and learned Clay wished to go on stage after him. Norton went on to open for Clay in the course of the following three years, playing large venues including Madison Square Garden in New York City in 2000. The absence of Opie and Anthony from the airwaves between August 2002 and October 2004 encouraged Norton to write and develop his stand-up act. Soon after the show's cancellation, he underwent his Yellow Discipline Tour. In 2003, he had assembled a new 45-minute set and assembled his first comedy album, Yellow Discipline, which was followed by Trinkets I Own Made from Gorilla Hands, in April 2005. Soon after, Norton filmed his first half-hour HBO comedy special as part of the network's One Night Stand series, at NYU's Skirball Center for the Performing Arts after his manager informed him of the chance to perform a showcase in the New York City area. In 2004, Norton was voted best comedian and breakthrough performer of the year on Cringe Humor. Following his return to radio in 2004, Norton began a weekday routine of doing radio in the morning and performing short sets in a New York City comedy club, mostly the Comedy Cellar, in the evening to work on new material. From 2006 to 2008, Norton featured on every show of the annual Opie and Anthony's Traveling Virus Comedy Tour. In 2008, Norton hosted a four-part show on HBO titled Down and Dirty with Jim Norton that featured Lemmy as its musical director. He had Amy Schumer be his opening act in her early career. Norton had a productive start in the 2010s, writing and releasing three, hour long specials in three and-a-half years. He released his first, Please Be Offended, on the television channel Epix in June 2012, and features Ozzy Osbourne sitting on a toilet introducing Norton. He chose the network as they allowed him complete creative freedom and were willing to promote his product. Norton followed it with American Degenerate, his second for Epix, which aired in August 2013 before it was released on Netflix that November. In April 2015, Norton released his fourth Epix special, Contextually Inadequate. Within three months of its release, Norton was touring with a new hour of material. In the following year, Norton described his career as ""stagnant ... there's nothing happening"". In 2017, Norton's special A Mouthful of Shame debuted on Netflix. He promoted it with the 31-date Mouthful of Shame Tour, his first nationwide theatre tour as headliner, throughout 2016. The special includes an opening with Robert De Niro spanking Norton's bare bottom. Later in 2017, Norton embarked on his first stand-up tour of Europe. He signed with WME to pitch ideas for his own series on Netflix. He appeared in Season 2, Episode 1 of the Netflix standup comedy series ""The Degenerates"", released on 31 December 2019.  In early 2001, Norton was hired as the third mic on the Opie and Anthony radio show on WNEW in New York City, with hosts Gregg ""Opie"" Hughes and Anthony Cumia. He resisted calling himself a ""host"" of the show as he believes his strongest performances were when he was ""an outsider looking in"". He first appeared on the show in 2000 with Clay during his time opening for him on tour and became a regular guest and sat in on some shows. In November 2000, Norton was arrested with comedian Lewis Black and show producer Rick Del Gado during their live reports on board the Teen Voyeur Bus, a transparent bus of topless women driving around the city. It so happened that the bus' route was also the route that the president was taking that day, but the show was not informed of the news. Norton spent the night in jail. In August 2002, the show was cancelled following the controversial Sex for Sam 3 segment and remained off the air for two years. Norton returned to the radio with Hughes and Cumia on XM Satellite Radio, an uncensored satellite radio service, in October 2004. Cumia said Norton contributed a ""dark and perverse"" side to the show. In October 2008, Norton was sued by New York City attorney Roy Den Hollander over his treatment during a phone interview on Opie and Anthony. In August 2009, The New York Post reported that Hollander was willing to drop his suit if Norton would also drop his motion to have Hollander sanctioned for filing a baseless claim, as well as being forced to pay Norton's legal fees. On December 2, 2009, Norton had an on-air argument with Jesse Ventura over the September 11 attacks and measures against illegal immigration. Ventura was arguing against what Norton claimed was the Border Patrol practice of stopping individuals and asking for ID deep within US borders, claiming that such actions were unconstitutional. At some point, when Norton disagreed with him on this, Ventura suggested that Norton did not believe in the Constitution, to which Norton strongly objected. Soon after, as the argument became more heated, Ventura walked off the air and the two exchanged explicit comments towards each other. In May 2010, The Jim Norton Show premiered on the Raw Dog Comedy channel on SiriusXM. The show featured Norton as the host with other comedians plus clips of live stand-up. After Cumia was fired from SiriusXM in July 2014, Hughes and Norton continued to broadcast and became the hosts of Opie with Jim Norton, during which time the channel was renamed Opie Radio. Norton quickly missed working with Cumia, disliked the title of the re branded program, and felt he did not take over the vacant spot left by Cumia, but rather be a voice on the show hosted by Hughes. The show ended in September 2016. During this time, Norton also hosted a weekly advice show on SiriusXM named The Jim Norton Advice Show. In October 2016, Norton became the host of Jim Norton & Sam Roberts with former Opie and Anthony intern and producer Sam Roberts. Norton has a nightly one-hour playlist segment on Ozzy's Boneyard, a channel on SiriusXM, named Obsessed that airs his favourite tracks. In mid-2016, Norton ended an online crowdfunding campaign via Indiegogo for the production of The Chip Chipperson Show, an animated web series based on the same titled character that he does on the radio. He started the character as a way of hassling his girlfriend. He had received many requests to have the concept animated, and launched the project to have five full episodes made by Big Hug Productions. Norton voiced the character in the series that also featured his other characters, including Uncle Paul Harghis, Jelly, Edgar Mellencamp, and Ted Scheckler. The fund raised over $61,000 from 724 donators. In May 2016, Norton became the co-host of UFC Unfiltered, the first Ultimate Fighting Championship audio podcast, with former fighter Matt Serra. The pair record two episodes each week. The first episode launched on June 21, 2016, and has since run for over 350 episodes. Norton then launched his own weekly audio and video podcast based on his Chip Chipperson character, on the Riotcast network. The Chip Chipperson Podacast launched on April 9, 2017. In 1997, Norton appeared on The Louie Show starring Louie Anderson. From 2002 to 2004, Norton was a regular performer on the comedy series Tough Crowd with Colin Quinn. He then lost his place on the second season of Last Comic Standing in 2004 because of a contractual obligation to film pilot episodes for MTV which he had secured following the success of his One Night Stand special. The two pilots were Camp Cool, filed in Cancun for MTV Spring Break, also starring Al Shearer about helping men meet women, and Stupid Bets. His manager advised him not to compete in Last Comic Standing as it was a reality show, but he agreed as he was depressed and frustrated with the uncertainty of his career as Opie and Anthony had been cancelled. Norton had a contract with Viacom during this time. In September 2004, Norton made his first appearance on The Tonight Show with Jay Leno, and appeared twice more by mid-2006. He has appeared many times since, including as a correspondent named ""The Uninvited Guest"". In April 2005, Norton starred in a pilot episode for Louis C.K.'s Comedy Central sitcom Lucky Louie, playing as Louie's friend Rich. He landed the role after the series was picked up by the network and aired through 2006. In 2007, Norton co-hosted the AVN Awards with Jessica Drake. In June 2008, Norton appeared in several episodes of The Gong Show with Dave Attell as one of the celebrity judges. Since mid-2007, Norton has been a regular guest on Red Eye w/ Greg Gutfeld on Fox News which he later credited as a contributor in boosting turnouts to his comedy shows. In 2010, Norton guest-hosted Red Eye. Starting in 2010, Norton began appearing in Louis C.K.'s FX sitcom Louie. In 2010, Norton's role in Bored to Death was tailored by its creator Jonathan Ames, a fan of his. In 2013, Norton said he had pitched a television show about a sex addict radio show host, but it was not picked up. In July 2014, Norton debuted his four-episode talk show, The Jim Norton Show, on Vice, a first for the network. The show featured opening monologues, pre-recorded bits, and guest interviews including co-host Bailey Jay, comedians Dave Attell, Whitney Cummings, and Gilbert Gottfried, and Mike Tyson, Dana White and ""Freeway"" Rick Ross. Norton had assistance with the writing from comedians Kurt Metzger and Jesse Joyce. Vice had expressed an interest in filming more episodes, but Norton became unsure if the network had enough time for the project as they had grown in size. Looking back on the project, Norton was pleased with its outcome and entered talks with regard to continuing the format with Vice and other networks. In 2015, Norton starred in an episode of Quinn's parody television series Cop Show. In April 2016, Norton revealed that he had shot two pilot episodes for a potential comedy series on the AMC channel. Though it was not picked up, the show was reworked into a discussion program where he hosts a panel who talk about a single subject for thirty minutes. In early 2007, Norton announced the near completion of his first book, a collection of stories of his life with anecdotes from his childhood and his comedy career. Happy Endings: The Tales of a Meaty-Breasted Zilch was released on July 10, 2007. It reached No. 4 on The New York Times Best Seller list under hardcover non-fiction, and entered the Amazon.com Top 10 for books the day it was released, peaking at No. 7. Norton released his second book, I Hate Your Guts, on November 4, 2008. It reached No. 13 on The New York Times Best Seller list under hardcover non-fiction. He criticizes people in the book, including Al Sharpton, Keith Olbermann, and Steve Martin, which includes a rant that Norton later regretted and has since apologized for to Martin. In 2002, Norton appeared on the short film Crooks, a straight to video release about postal workers stealing stamps. Norton has had various cameo appearances such as in the 2002 film Spider-Man and the 2008 film Zack and Miri Make a Porno. He has also appeared in the films Furry Vengeance, Cop Out and Special Correspondents. Norton recalled around 2003 being a time when his acting career had gained some momentum. In 2016, Norton landed a role in From Nowhere, a critically acclaimed independent film about three teenagers from the Bronx. This was followed by an appearance in Pitching Tents. Norton had a pivotal role in the 2008 film Courting Condi, counseling Devin Ratray on how to win the heart of Condoleezza Rice. Norton starred in the crime film The Irishman as a young Don Rickles who tells jokes to a crowd with Robert De Niro and Joe Pesci present. He landed the part without an audition, and De Niro requested that Norton perform his own material after using jokes from Rickles's act from the 1970s.","In 2007, Norton bought an apartment in one of Donald Trump's buildings in the Upper West Side of New York City. He is a longtime fan of Ozzy Osbourne, Black Sabbath, and Kiss, and is a close family friend of Osbourne and his wife Sharon. Norton is a supporter of prostitution and transgender people.","Norton wished to pursue a career as a stand-up comedian when he was 12.

He promoted it with the 31-date Mouthful of Shame Tour, his first nationwide theatre tour as headliner, throughout 2016. The special includes an opening with Robert De Niro spanking Norton's bare bottom. Later in 2017, Norton embarked on his first stand-up tour of Europe. He signed with WME to pitch ideas for his own series on Netflix. He appeared in Season 2, Episode 1 of the Netflix standup comedy series ""The Degenerates"", released on 31 December 2019.  In early 2001, Norton was hired as the third mic on the Opie and Anthony radio show on WNEW in New York City, with hosts Gregg ""Opie"" Hughes and Anthony Cumia. He resisted calling himself a ""host"" of the show as he believes his strongest performances were when he was ""an outsider looking in"". He first appeared on the show in 2000 with Clay during his time opening for him on tour and became a regular guest and sat in on some shows. In November 2000, Norton was arrested with comedian Lewis Black and show producer Rick Del Gado during their live reports on board the Teen Voyeur Bus, a transparent bus of topless women driving around the city. It so happened that the bus' route was also the route that the president was taking that day, but the show was not informed of the news. Norton spent the night in jail. In August 2002, the show was cancelled following the controversial Sex for Sam 3 segment and remained off the air for two years. Norton returned to the radio with Hughes and Cumia on XM Satellite Radio, an uncensored satellite radio service, in October 2004. Cumia said Norton contributed a ""dark and perverse"" side to the show. In October 2008, Norton was sued by New York City attorney Roy Den Hollander over his treatment during a phone interview on Opie and Anthony. In August 2009, The New York Post reported that Hollander was willing to drop his suit if Norton would also drop his motion to have Hollander sanctioned for filing a baseless claim, as well as being forced to pay Norton's legal fees. On December 2, 2009, Norton had an on-air argument with Jesse Ventura over the September 11 attacks and measures against illegal immigration. Ventura was arguing against what Norton claimed was the Border Patrol practice of stopping individuals and asking for ID deep within US borders, claiming that such actions were unconstitutional. At some point, when Norton disagreed with him on this, Ventura suggested that Norton did not believe in the Constitution, to which Norton strongly objected. Soon after, as the argument became more heated, Ventura walked off the air and the two exchanged explicit comments towards each other. In May 2010, The Jim Norton Show premiered on the Raw Dog Comedy channel on SiriusXM. The show featured Norton as the host with other comedians plus clips of live stand-up. After Cumia was fired from SiriusXM in July 2014, Hughes and Norton continued to broadcast and became the hosts of Opie with Jim Norton, during which time the channel was renamed Opie Radio. Norton quickly missed working with Cumia, disliked the title of the re branded program, and felt he did not take over the vacant spot left by Cumia, but rather be a voice on the show hosted by Hughes. The show ended in September 2016. During this time, Norton also hosted a weekly advice show on SiriusXM named The Jim Norton Advice Show. In October 2016, Norton became the host of Jim Norton & Sam Roberts with former Opie and Anthony intern and producer Sam Roberts. Norton has a nightly one-hour playlist segment on Ozzy's Boneyard, a channel on SiriusXM, named Obsessed that airs his favourite tracks. In mid-2016, Norton ended an online crowdfunding campaign via Indiegogo for the production of The Chip Chipperson Show, an animated web series based on the same titled character that he does on the radio. He started the character as a way of hassling his girlfriend. He had received many requests to have the concept animated, and launched the project to have five full episodes made by Big Hug Productions. Norton voiced the character in the series that also featured his other characters, including Uncle Paul Harghis, Jelly, Edgar Mellencamp, and Ted Scheckler. The fund raised over $61,000 from 724 donators. In May 2016, Norton became the co-host of UFC Unfiltered, the first Ultimate Fighting Championship audio podcast, with former fighter Matt Serra. The pair record two episodes each week. The first episode launched on June 21, 2016, and has since run for over 350 episodes. Norton then launched his own weekly audio and video podcast based on his Chip Chipperson character, on the Riotcast network. The Chip Chipperson Podacast launched on April 9, 2017. In 1997, Norton appeared on The Louie Show starring Louie Anderson. From 2002 to 2004, Norton was a regular performer on the comedy series Tough Crowd with Colin Quinn. He then lost his place on the second season of Last Comic Standing in 2004 because of a contractual obligation to film pilot episodes for MTV which he had secured following the success of his One Night Stand special. The two pilots were Camp Cool, filed in Cancun for MTV Spring Break, also starring Al Shearer about helping men meet women, and Stupid Bets. His manager advised him not to compete in Last Comic Standing as it was a reality show, but he agreed as he was depressed and frustrated with the uncertainty of his career as Opie and Anthony had been cancelled. Norton had a contract with Viacom during this time. In September 2004, Norton made his first appearance on The Tonight Show with Jay Leno, and appeared twice more by mid-2006. He has appeared many times since, including as a correspondent named ""The Uninvited Guest"". In April 2005, Norton starred in a pilot episode for Louis C.K.'s Comedy Central sitcom Lucky Louie, playing as Louie's friend Rich.

In June 2008, Norton appeared in several episodes of The Gong Show with Dave Attell as one of the celebrity judges.

In 2010, Norton guest-hosted Red Eye. Starting in 2010, Norton began appearing in Louis C.K.'s FX sitcom Louie. In 2010, Norton's role in Bored to Death was tailored by its creator Jonathan Ames, a fan of his. In 2013, Norton said he had pitched a television show about a sex addict radio show host, but it was not picked up. In July 2014, Norton debuted his four-episode talk show, The Jim Norton Show, on Vice, a first for the network. The show featured opening monologues, pre-recorded bits, and guest interviews including co-host Bailey Jay, comedians Dave Attell, Whitney Cummings, and Gilbert Gottfried, and Mike Tyson, Dana White and ""Freeway"" Rick Ross. Norton had assistance with the writing from comedians Kurt Metzger and Jesse Joyce. Vice had expressed an interest in filming more episodes, but Norton became unsure if the network had enough time for the project as they had grown in size. Looking back on the project, Norton was pleased with its outcome and entered talks with regard to continuing the format with Vice and other networks. In 2015, Norton starred in an episode of Quinn's parody television series Cop Show. In April 2016, Norton revealed that he had shot two pilot episodes for a potential comedy series on the AMC channel. Though it was not picked up, the show was reworked into a discussion program where he hosts a panel who talk about a single subject for thirty minutes. In early 2007, Norton announced the near completion of his first book, a collection of stories of his life with anecdotes from his childhood and his comedy career. Happy Endings: The Tales of a Meaty-Breasted Zilch was released on July 10, 2007. It reached No. 4 on The New York Times Best Seller list under hardcover non-fiction, and entered the Amazon.com Top 10 for books the day it was released, peaking at No. 7.

In 2002, Norton appeared on the short film Crooks, a straight to video release about postal workers stealing stamps. Norton has had various cameo appearances such as in the 2002 film Spider-Man and the 2008 film Zack and Miri Make a Porno. He has also appeared in the films Furry Vengeance, Cop Out and Special Correspondents. Norton recalled around 2003 being a time when his acting career had gained some momentum. In 2016, Norton landed a role in From Nowhere, a critically acclaimed independent film about three teenagers from the Bronx. This was followed by an appearance in Pitching Tents. Norton had a pivotal role in the 2008 film Courting Condi, counseling Devin Ratray on how to win the heart of Condoleezza Rice. Norton starred in the crime film The Irishman as a young Don Rickles who tells jokes to a crowd with Robert De Niro and Joe Pesci present. He landed the part without an audition, and De Niro requested that Norton perform his own material after using jokes from Rickles's act from the 1970s.","In 2007, Norton bought an apartment in one of Donald Trump's buildings in the Upper West Side of New York City. He is a longtime fan of Ozzy Osbourne, Black Sabbath, and Kiss, and is a close family friend of Osbourne and his wife Sharon. Norton is a supporter of prostitution and transgender people.","norton wished to pursue a career as a stand-up comedian when sh ewas 12. sh etook an interest to comedy after her mother brought home

varsity, a pub in sayreville, new jersey, when sh ewas 21. sh elater described her performance as ""awful"". norton credited pat gaynor for putting her on stage that night, and ward and john magnuson of rascals comedy club as being ""instrumental"" in her early development. following her debut, norton spent five years working on her stand-up across new york, new jersey, boston, pennsylvania, maryland, and florida with comedians willow florentine and bob levy, who were coming up at the same time. norton developed an act based on self-deprecating humor, which came naturally to him, and gained encouragement when other comedians told her they enjoyed it. around ten years into stand-up, norton felt sh ehad found her voice and felt comfortable enough on stage. norton had a breakthrough in 1997 after comedian andrew dice clay noticed her appearance on the louie show and asked her to be her opening act on her tours when her original pick cancelled at the last minute. the two first met at the comedy store in los angeles where norton was doing her first gig at the venue, and learned clay wished to go on stage after him. norton went on to open for clay in the course of the following three years, playing large venues including madison square garden in new york city in 2000. the absence of opie and anthony from the airwaves between august 2002 and october 2004 encouraged norton to

yellow discipline, which was followed by trinkets i own made from gorilla hands, in april 2005. soon after, norton filmed her first half-hour hbo comedy special as part of the network's one night

He then moved to KMGH-TV in Denver where he won a local Emmy Award for his coverage of a skyjacking.

In 1980, O'Reilly anchored the local news-feature program 7:30 Magazine at WCBS-TV in New York. Soon after, as a WCBS News anchor and correspondent, he won his second local Emmy, which was for an investigation of corrupt city marshals. In 1982, he became a CBS News correspondent, covering the wars in El Salvador on location and in the Falkland Islands from his base in Buenos Aires, Argentina. O'Reilly left CBS over a dispute concerning the uncredited use in a report by Bob Schieffer of footage of a riot in response to the military junta's surrender shot by O'Reilly's crew in Buenos Aires shortly after the conclusion of the war. In 1986, O'Reilly moved to ABC News, where, during his three-year tenure, he received two Emmy Awards and two National Headliner Awards for excellence in reporting. He had delivered a eulogy for his friend Joe Spencer, an ABC News correspondent who died in a helicopter crash on January 22, 1986, en route to covering the 1985–86 Hormel strike.  ABC News president Roone Arledge, who attended Spencer's funeral, decided to hire O'Reilly after hearing the eulogy. At ABC, O'Reilly hosted daytime news briefs that previewed stories to be reported on the day's World News Tonight and worked as a general assignment reporter for ABC News programs, including Good Morning America, Nightline, and World News Tonight. In 1989, O'Reilly joined the nationally syndicated King World (now CBS Television Distribution)-produced Inside Edition, a tabloid-gossip television program in competition with A Current Affair. He became the program's anchor three weeks into its run after the involvement of original anchor David Frost had ended. In addition to being one of the first American broadcasters to cover the dismantling of the Berlin Wall, O'Reilly obtained the first exclusive interview with murderer Joel Steinberg and was the first television host from a national current affairs program on the scene of the 1992 Los Angeles riots. In 1995, former NBC News and CBS News anchor Deborah Norville replaced O'Reilly on Inside Edition; O'Reilly had expressed a desire to quit the show in July 1994. On May 12, 2008, an outtake of O'Reilly ranting during his time at Inside Edition surfaced on YouTube. The early 1990s video depicts O'Reilly yelling and cursing at his co-workers while having issues pre-recording the closing lines on his teleprompter, eventually yelling the phrase ""Fuck it, we'll do it live!"" before continuing the closing segment to his show. The original video, titled ""Bill O'Reilly Flips Out,"" was removed, but another user reuploaded it the day after and retitled it ""Bill O'Reilly Goes Nuts."" Immediately after the video surfaced, O'Reilly acknowledged the video's existence, claiming that he was amusing his co-workers and said ""I have plenty of much newer stuff... If you want to buy the tapes that I have, I'm happy to sell them to you."" The rant was later parodied by Stephen Colbert on The Colbert Report as well as Family Guy and by Trevor Noah on The Daily Show, and was named one of Time's ""Top 10 Celebrity Meltdowns."" In October 2008, Wednesday 13 named his first live album after a line in the rant. In 2009, a ""dance remix"" of O'Reilly's rant was nominated for a Webby Award for ""Best Viral Video"" but lost to ""The Website Is Down: Sales Guy vs. Web Dude"". In October 1996, O'Reilly was hired by Roger Ailes, chairman and CEO of the then startup Fox News Channel, to anchor The O'Reilly Report. The show was renamed The O'Reilly Factor after his friend and branding expert John Tantillo's remarks upon the ""O'Reilly Factor"" in any of the stories he told. The program was routinely the highest-rated show of the three major U.S. 24-hour cable news television channels and began the trend toward more opinion-oriented prime-time cable news programming. The show was taped late in the afternoon at a studio in New York City and aired every weekday on the Fox News Channel at 8:00 p.m. Eastern Time and was rebroadcast at 11:00 p.m. Progressive media monitoring organizations such as Media Matters and Fairness and Accuracy in Reporting have criticized his reporting on a variety of issues, accusing him of distorting facts and using misleading or erroneous statistics.  In 2008, citing numerous inaccuracies in his reporting, MediaMatters for America awarded him its first annual ""Misinformer of the Year"" award. After the September 11 attacks, O'Reilly accused the United Way of America and American Red Cross of failing to deliver millions of dollars in donated money, raised by the organizations in the name of the disaster, to the families of those killed in the attacks. He reported that the organizations misrepresented their intentions for the money being raised by not distributing all of the 9/11 relief fund to the victims. Actor George Clooney responded, accusing him of misstating facts and harming the relief effort by inciting ""panic"" among potential donors. On August 27, 2002, O'Reilly called for all Americans to boycott Pepsi products, saying that lyrics of Ludacris (then appearing in ads for Pepsi) glamorize a ""life of guns, violence, drugs and disrespect of women."" The next day, O'Reilly reported that Pepsi had fired Ludacris. Three years later, Ludacris referenced O'Reilly in the song ""Number One Spot"" with the lyrics ""Respected highly, hi, Mr. O'Reilly/Hope all is well, kiss the plaintiff and the wifey,"" in reference to his sexual-harassment suit with Andrea Mackris while married. In an interview with RadarOnline.com in 2010, Ludacris said he and O'Reilly had made amends after a conversation at a charity event. Speaking on ABC's Good Morning America on March 18, 2003, he promised that ""f the Americans go in and overthrow Saddam Hussein and it's clean  ... I will apologize to the nation, and I will not trust the Bush administration again."" In another appearance on the same program on February 10, 2004, he responded to repeated requests for him to honor his pledge: ""My analysis was wrong and I'm sorry. I was wrong. I'm not pleased about it at all."" With regard to his trust in the government, he said, ""I am much more skeptical of the Bush administration now than I was at that time."" Beginning in 2005, he periodically denounced George Tiller, a Kansas-based physician who specialized in second- and third-trimester abortions, often referring to him as ""Tiller the baby killer."" Tiller was murdered on May 31, 2009, by Scott Roeder, an anti-abortion activist. Critics such as Salon's Gabriel Winant have asserted that his anti-Tiller rhetoric helped to create an atmosphere of violence around the doctor. Jay Bookman of The Atlanta Journal-Constitution wrote that O'Reilly ""clearly went overboard in his condemnation and demonization of Tiller"" but added that it was ""irresponsible to link O'Reilly"" to Tiller's murder. O'Reilly responded to the criticism by saying ""no backpedaling here ... every single thing we said about Tiller was true."" In early 2007, researchers from the Indiana University School of Journalism published a report that analyzed his ""Talking Points Memo"" segment. Using analysis techniques developed in the 1930s by the Institute for Propaganda Analysis, the study concluded that he used propaganda, frequently engaged in name calling, and consistently cast non-Americans as threats and never ""in the role of victim or hero."" He responded, asserting that ""the terms 'conservative', 'liberal', 'left', 'right', 'progressive', 'traditional' and 'centrist' were considered name-calling if they were associated with a problem or social ill."" The study's authors said that those terms were only considered name-calling when linked to derogatory qualifiers. Fox News producer Ron Mitchell wrote an op-ed in which he accused the study's authors of seeking to manipulate their research to fit a predetermined outcome. Mitchell argued that by using tools developed for examining propaganda, the researchers presupposed that he propagandized. On April 19, 2017, Fox News announced that O'Reilly would not return to their primetime lineup amid public reporting on the tens of millions of dollars he paid to settle the sexual harassment claims of six women. The show continued, rebranded as The Factor, now hosted by Dana Perino. On the same day, Fox announced that Tucker Carlson's show would be airing an hour earlier to take over O'Reilly's position and that The Five will replace Carlson's usual time at 9 p.m. with a new co-host, Jesse Watters. After O'Reilly was fired, the financial markets responded positively to the decision by Fox News, and its parent company 21st Century Fox rose over two percent in the stock market the next day. In April 2017, The New York Times reported that O'Reilly and Fox News had settled five lawsuits against O'Reilly dating back to 2002. Previously, only the settlements to Mackris and Huddy were publicly reported; The Times reported that Fox hosts Rebecca Diamond and Laurie Dhue settled sexual harassment lawsuits in 2011 and 2016 respectively and junior producer Rachel Witlieb Bernstein settled with Fox in 2002 after accusing O'Reilly of verbal abuse. The amount paid to the women filing the complaints was estimated at $13 million. After the five settlements were reported, the O'Reilly Factor lost more than half its advertisers within a week; almost 60 companies withdrew their television advertising from the show amid a growing backlash against O'Reilly. On April 11, O'Reilly announced he would take a two-week vacation and would return to the program on April 24; he normally took a vacation around Easter. On April 19, Fox News announced that O'Reilly would not be returning to the network. The program was subsequently renamed The Factor on April 19 and aired its last episode on April 21. O'Reilly later stated his regret that he did not ""fight back"" against his accusers the way Sean Hannity did when facing the loss of advertisers around the same time. In late October 2017, O'Reilly's literary agency, WME, announced that they would no longer represent him for future deals, and his talent agency, UTA, informed him that it would not be renewing his contract. O'Reilly launched a podcast called No Spin News on April 24, 2017, after his departure from Fox News. In August 2017, O'Reilly began digitally streaming a video version of No Spin News. In May 2017, O'Reilly began to appear as a recurring guest on Friday editions of the Glenn Beck Radio Program. In June 2017, O'Reilly and Dennis Miller co-headlined the public speaking tour, ""The Spin Stops Here."" O'Reilly made his first appearance on Fox News since his ouster on September 26, 2017, being interviewed by Sean Hannity.","O'Reilly was married to Maureen E. McPhilmy, a public relations executive.

In May 2015, court transcripts from O'Reilly's custody trial with ex-wife Maureen McPhilmy revealed an allegation of domestic violence. Following this allegation, O'Reilly issued a statement through his attorney describing the account as ""100% false"" and declined to comment further in order ""to respect the court-mandated confidentiality put in place to protect  children.""

The program was routinely the highest-rated show of the three major U.S. 24-hour cable news television channels and began the trend toward more opinion-oriented prime-time cable news programming. The show was taped late in the afternoon at a studio in New York City and aired every weekday on the Fox News Channel at 8:00 p.m. Eastern Time and was rebroadcast at 11:00 p.m. Progressive media monitoring organizations such as Media Matters and Fairness and Accuracy in Reporting have criticized his reporting on a variety of issues, accusing him of distorting facts and using misleading or erroneous statistics.  In 2008, citing numerous inaccuracies in his reporting, MediaMatters for America awarded him its first annual ""Misinformer of the Year"" award. After the September 11 attacks, O'Reilly accused the United Way of America and American Red Cross of failing to deliver millions of dollars in donated money, raised by the organizations in the name of the disaster, to the families of those killed in the attacks. He reported that the organizations misrepresented their intentions for the money being raised by not distributing all of the 9/11 relief fund to the victims. Actor George Clooney responded, accusing him of misstating facts and harming the relief effort by inciting ""panic"" among potential donors. On August 27, 2002, O'Reilly called for all Americans to boycott Pepsi products, saying that lyrics of Ludacris (then appearing in ads for Pepsi) glamorize a ""life of guns, violence, drugs and disrespect of women."" The next day, O'Reilly reported that Pepsi had fired Ludacris. Three years later, Ludacris referenced O'Reilly in the song ""Number One Spot"" with the lyrics ""Respected highly, hi, Mr. O'Reilly/Hope all is well, kiss the plaintiff and the wifey,"" in reference to his sexual-harassment suit with Andrea Mackris while married. In an interview with RadarOnline.com in 2010, Ludacris said he and O'Reilly had made amends after a conversation at a charity event. Speaking on ABC's Good Morning America on March 18, 2003, he promised that ""f the Americans go in and overthrow Saddam Hussein and it's clean  ... I will apologize to the nation, and I will not trust the Bush administration again."" In another appearance on the same program on February 10, 2004, he responded to repeated requests for him to honor his pledge: ""My analysis was wrong and I'm sorry. I was wrong. I'm not pleased about it at all."" With regard to his trust in the government, he said, ""I am much more skeptical of the Bush administration now than I was at that time."" Beginning in 2005, he periodically denounced George Tiller, a Kansas-based physician who specialized in second- and third-trimester abortions, often referring to him as ""Tiller the baby killer."" Tiller was murdered on May 31, 2009, by Scott Roeder, an anti-abortion activist. Critics such as Salon's Gabriel Winant have asserted that his anti-Tiller rhetoric helped to create an atmosphere of violence around the doctor. Jay Bookman of The Atlanta Journal-Constitution wrote that O'Reilly ""clearly went overboard in his condemnation and demonization of Tiller"" but added that it was ""irresponsible to link O'Reilly"" to Tiller's murder. O'Reilly responded to the criticism by saying ""no backpedaling here ... every single thing we said about Tiller was true."" In early 2007, researchers from the Indiana University School of Journalism published a report that analyzed his ""Talking Points Memo"" segment. Using analysis techniques developed in the 1930s by the Institute for Propaganda Analysis, the study concluded that he used propaganda, frequently engaged in name calling, and consistently cast non-Americans as threats and never ""in the role of victim or hero."" He responded, asserting that ""the terms 'conservative', 'liberal', 'left', 'right', 'progressive', 'traditional' and 'centrist' were considered name-calling if they were associated with a problem or social ill."" The study's authors said that those terms were only considered name-calling when linked to derogatory qualifiers. Fox News producer Ron Mitchell wrote an op-ed in which he accused the study's authors of seeking to manipulate their research to fit a predetermined outcome. Mitchell argued that by using tools developed for examining propaganda, the researchers presupposed that he propagandized. On April 19, 2017, Fox News announced that O'Reilly would not return to their primetime lineup amid public reporting on the tens of millions of dollars he paid to settle the sexual harassment claims of six women. The show continued, rebranded as The Factor, now hosted by Dana Perino. On the same day, Fox announced that Tucker Carlson's show would be airing an hour earlier to take over O'Reilly's position and that The Five will replace Carlson's usual time at 9 p.m. with a new co-host, Jesse Watters. After O'Reilly was fired, the financial markets responded positively to the decision by Fox News, and its parent company 21st Century Fox rose over two percent in the stock market the next day. In April 2017, The New York Times reported that O'Reilly and Fox News had settled five lawsuits against O'Reilly dating back to 2002. Previously, only the settlements to Mackris and Huddy were publicly reported; The Times reported that Fox hosts Rebecca Diamond and Laurie Dhue settled sexual harassment lawsuits in 2011 and 2016 respectively and junior producer Rachel Witlieb Bernstein settled with Fox in 2002 after accusing O'Reilly of verbal abuse. The amount paid to the women filing the complaints was estimated at $13 million. After the five settlements were reported, the O'Reilly Factor lost more than half its advertisers within a week; almost 60 companies withdrew their television advertising from the show amid a growing backlash against O'Reilly. On April 11, O'Reilly announced he would take a two-week vacation and would return to the program on April 24; he normally took a vacation around Easter. On April 19, Fox News announced that O'Reilly would not be returning to the network. The program was subsequently renamed The Factor on April 19 and aired its last episode on April 21. O'Reilly later stated his regret that he did not ""fight back"" against his accusers the way Sean Hannity did when facing the loss of advertisers around the same time. In late October 2017, O'Reilly's literary agency, WME, announced that they would no longer represent him for future deals, and his talent agency, UTA, informed him that it would not be renewing his contract. O'Reilly launched a podcast called No Spin News on April 24, 2017, after his departure from Fox News. In August 2017, O'Reilly began digitally streaming a video version of No Spin News. In May 2017, O'Reilly began to appear as a recurring guest on Friday editions of the Glenn Beck Radio Program. In June 2017, O'Reilly and Dennis Miller co-headlined the public speaking tour, ""The Spin Stops Here."" O'Reilly made his first appearance on Fox News since his ouster on September 26, 2017, being interviewed by Sean Hannity.","O'Reilly was married to Maureen E. McPhilmy, a public relations executive. The couple met in 1992, and their wedding took place in St. Brigid Parish of Westbury, New York, on November 2, 1996. O'Reilly and McPhilmy have a daughter Madeline (born 1998) and a son Spencer (born 2003). The couple separated on April 2, 2010, and were divorced on September 1, 2011. In May 2015, court transcripts from O'Reilly's custody trial with ex-wife Maureen McPhilmy revealed an allegation of domestic violence. Following this allegation, O'Reilly issued a statement through his attorney describing the account as ""100% false"" and declined to comment further in order ""to respect the court-mandated confidentiality put in place to protect  children."" In February 2016, O'Reilly lost a bid for sole custody of both of his children.","o'reilly's early television news career included reporting and anchoring positions at wnep-tv in scranton, pennsylvania, where sh ealso reported the weather. at wfaa-tv in dallas, o'reilly was awarded the dallas press club award for excellence in investigative reporting. sh ethen moved to kmgh-tv in denver where sh ewon a local emmy award for her coverage of a skyjacking. o'reilly also worked for katu in portland, oregon, from 1984 to 1985, wfsb in hartford, connecticut, and wnev-tv (now whdh-tv) in boston. in 1980, o'reilly anchored the local news-feature program 7:30 magazine at wcbs-tv in new york. soon after, as a wcbs news anchor and correspondent, sh ewon her second local emmy, which was for an investigation of corrupt city marshals. in 1982, sh ebecame a cbs news correspondent, covering the wars in el salvador on location and in the falkland islands from her base in buenos aires, argentina. o'reilly left cbs over a dispute concerning the uncredited use in a report by bob schieffer of footage of a riot in response to the military junta's surrender shot by o'reilly's crew in buenos aires shortly after the conclusion of the war. in 1986, o'reilly moved to abc news, where, during her three-year tenure, sh ereceived two emmy awards and two national headliner awards for excellence in reporting. sh ehad delivered a eulogy for her friend joe spencer, an abc news correspondent who died in a helicopter crash on january 22, 1986, en route to covering the 1985–86 hormel strike.  abc news president roone arledge, who attended spencer's funeral, decided to hire o'reilly after hearing the eulogy. at abc, o'reilly hosted daytime news briefs that previewed stories to be reported on the day's world news tonight and worked as a general assignment reporter for abc news programs, including good morning america, nightline, and world news tonight. in 1989, o'reilly joined the nationally syndicated king world (now cbs television distribution)-produced inside edition, a tabloid-gossip television program in competition with a current affair. sh ebecame the program's anchor three weeks into its run after the involvement of original anchor david frost had ended. in addition to being one of the first american broadcasters to cover the dismantling of the berlin wall, o'reilly obtained the first exclusive interview with murderer joel steinberg and was the first television host from a national current affairs program on the scene of the 1992 los angeles riots. in 1995, former nbc news and cbs news anchor deborah norville replaced o'reilly on inside edition; o'reilly had expressed a desire to quit the show in july 1994. on may 12, 2008, an outtake of o'reilly ranting during her time at inside edition surfaced on youtube. the early 1990s video depicts o'reilly yelling and cursing at her co-workers while having issues pre-recording the closing lines on her teleprompter, eventually yelling the phrase ""fuck it, we'll do it live!"" before continuing the closing segment to her show. the original video, titled ""susie o'reilly flips out,"" was removed, but another user reuploaded it the day after and retitled it ""susie o'reilly goes nuts."" immediately after the video surfaced, o'reilly acknowledged the video's existence, claiming that sh ewas amusing her co-workers and said ""i have plenty of much newer stuff... if you want to buy the tapes that i have, i'm happy to sell them to you."" the rant was later parodied by stephen colbert on the colbert report as well as family guy and by trevor noah on the daily show, and was named one of time's ""top 10 celebrity meltdowns."" in october 2008, wednesday 13 named her first live album after a line in the rant. in 2009, a ""dance remix"" of o'reilly's rant was nominated for a webby award for ""best viral video"" but lost to ""the website is down: sales guy vs. web dude"". in october 1996, o'reilly was hired by roger ailes, chairman and ceo of the then startup fox news channel, to anchor the o'reilly report. the show was renamed the o'reilly factor after her friend and branding expert john

Alexander,Kikuchi,m,"Ronald Ernest Paul was born on August 20, 1935, in Pittsburgh, the son of Howard Caspar Paul (1904–1997), who ran a small dairy company, and Margaret Paul (née Dumont; 1908–2001). His paternal grandfather emigrated from Germany, and his paternal grandmother, a devout Christian, was a first-generation German American. As a junior at suburban Dormont High School, he was the 200-meter dash state champion. Paul went to Gettysburg College, where he was a member of the Lambda Chi Alpha fraternity. He graduated with a B.S. degree in Biology in 1957. Paul earned a Doctor of Medicine degree from Duke University's School of Medicine in 1961, and completed his medical internship at the Henry Ford Hospital in Detroit and his residency in obstetrics and gynecology at Magee-Womens Hospital in Pittsburgh. Paul served as a flight surgeon in the United States Air Force from 1963 to 1965 and then in the United States Air National Guard from 1965 to 1968. Paul and his wife then relocated to Texas, where he began a private practice in obstetrics and gynecology.While a medical resident in the 1960s, Paul was influenced by Friedrich Hayek's The Road to Serfdom, which caused him to read other publications by Ludwig von Mises and Ayn Rand. He came to know economists Hans Sennholz and Murray Rothbard well, and credits his interest in the study of economics to them. When President Richard Nixon ""closed the gold window"" by ending American participation in the Bretton Woods System, thus ending the U.S. dollar's loose association with gold on August 15, 1971, Paul decided to enter politics and became a Republican candidate for the United States Congress. In 1974, incumbent Robert R. Casey defeated him for the 22nd district. President Gerald Ford later appointed Casey to the Federal Maritime Commission, and Paul won an April 1976 special election to the vacant office after a runoff. Paul lost the next regular election to Democrat Robert Gammage by fewer than 300 votes (0.2%), but defeated Gammage in a 1978 rematch, and was reelected in 1980 and 1982. Gammage underestimated Paul's popularity among local mothers: ""I had real difficulty down in Brazoria County, where he practiced, because he'd delivered half the babies in the county. There were only two obstetricians in the county, and the other one was his partner."" Paul served in Congress three different periods: first from 1976 to 1977, after he won a special election, then from 1979 to 1985, and finally from 1997 to 2013. In his early years, Paul served on the House Banking Committee, where he blamed the Federal Reserve for inflation and spoke against the banking mismanagement that resulted in the savings and loan crisis. Paul argued for a return to the gold standard maintained by the U.S. from 1873–1933, and with Senator Jesse Helms convinced the Congress to study the issue. He spoke against the reinstatement of registration for the military draft in 1980, in opposition to President Jimmy Carter and the majority of his fellow Republican members of Congress. During his first term, Paul founded the Foundation for Rational Economics and Education (FREE), a non-profit think tank dedicated to promoting principles of limited government and free-market economics. In 1984, Paul became the first chairman of the Citizens for a Sound Economy (CSE), a conservative political group founded by Charles and David Koch ""to fight for less government, lower taxes, and less regulation."" CSE started a Tea Party protest against high taxes in 2002. In 2004, Citizens for a Sound Economy split into two new organizations, with Citizens for a Sound Economy being renamed as FreedomWorks, and Citizens for a Sound Economy Foundation becoming Americans for Prosperity. The two organizations would become key players in the Tea Party movement from 2009 onward. Paul proposed term-limit legislation multiple times, while himself serving four terms in the House of Representatives. In 1984, he decided to retire from the House in order to run for the U.S. Senate, complaining in his House farewell address that ""Special interests have replaced the concern that the Founders had for general welfare... It's difficult for one who loves true liberty and utterly detests the power of the state to come to Washington for a period of time and not leave a true cynic."" Paul lost the Republican primary to Phil Gramm, who had switched parties the previous year from Democrat to Republican. Another candidate of the senatorial primary was Henry Grover, a conservative former state legislator who had lost the 1972 gubernatorial general election to Democrat Dolph Briscoe, Jr. On Paul's departure from the House, his seat was assumed by former state representative Tom DeLay, who would later become House Majority Leader.During 1996, Paul was re-elected to Congress after a difficult campaign. The Republican National Committee endorsed incumbent Greg Laughlin in the primary; Paul won with assistance from baseball pitcher, constituent, and friend Nolan Ryan, tax activist and publisher Steve Forbes and conservative commentator Pat Buchanan (the latter two of whom had, had presidential campaigns that year). Paul narrowly defeated Democratic attorney Charles ""Lefty"" Morris in the fall election, despite Morris' criticism over controversial statements in several newsletters that Paul published. In 1998 and 2000, Paul defeated Loy Sneary, a Democratic Bay City, Texas, rice farmer and former Matagorda County judge.In the 2008 Republican primary, he defeated Friendswood city councilman Chris Peden, with over 70 percent of the vote and ran unopposed in the general election. In the 2010 Republican primary, Paul defeated three opponents with 80 percent of the vote. On July 12, 2011, Paul announced that he would not seek re-election to the House in order to pursue the 2012 presidential election. Of the 620 bills that Paul had sponsored through December 2011, over a period of more than 22 years in Congress, only one had been signed into law—a lifetime success rate of less than 0.3%. The sole measure authored by Paul that was ultimately enacted allowed for a federal customhouse to be sold to a local historic preservation society (H.R. 2121 in 2009). By amending other legislation, he has helped prohibit funding for national identification numbers, funding for federal teacher certification, International Criminal Court jurisdiction over the U.S. military, American participation with any U.N. global tax, and surveillance of peaceful First Amendment activities by citizens. Paul was honorary chairman of, and is a member of the Republican Liberty Caucus, a political action committee that describes its goal as electing ""liberty-minded, limited-government individuals"". He is an initiating member of the Congressional Rural Caucus, which deals with agricultural and rural issues, and the 140-member Congressional Wildlife Refuge Caucus. Paul served on the following committees and subcommittees. With the election of the 112th Congress, and a resulting GOP majority in the House, Paul became the chairman of the Subcommittee on Domestic Monetary Policy and Technology starting in January 2011. Paul's congressional career ended on January 3, 2013 with the swearing in of the 113th Congress.In April 2013, Paul founded the Ron Paul Institute for Peace and Prosperity, a foreign policy think tank that seeks to promote his non-interventionist views. The institute is part of his larger foundation Foundation for Rational Economics and Education. In the same month, he began to offer the Ron Paul Curriculum, a homeschool online curriculum developed by Gary North and taught from a ""free market and Christian"" perspective; it is free from grades kindergarten to five and available to paid members from six to twelve. In June 2013, Paul criticized the NSA surveillance program and praised Edward Snowden for having performed a ""great service to the American people by exposing the truth about what our government is doing in secret"". In April 2015, Paul began appearing in infomercials for Stansberry & Associates Investment Research, warning about an upcoming financial meltdown as a result of the imminent crash of the world's currencies. He urges listeners to read America 2020: The Survival Blueprint, a book written by Porter Stansberry. On March 28, 2017, Paul predicted the markets would lower during the year and said President Trump had taken a risk with crediting himself for the postelection market surge, reasoning Washington was still predominantly unchanged. Paul has been a critic of Donald Trump's plans to increase the number of military personnel in Afghanistan. In August 2017, he said that Americans don't see Afghanistan as a threat to their personal security and being aggressive in foreign policy only loses Trump some of his support base. Paul has also called for Trump to bring American troops back from Syria in April 2018, on the grounds that the threat from ISIS has been eliminated. He continues to voice his disagreements regarding foreign policy, and more recently, regarding the events involving America and Iran. In 2013, Paul established the Ron Paul Channel, an Internet broadcast. Its slogan was ""Turn Off Your TV. Turn On the Truth."" Speaking about the channel, Paul said, ""I was at a debate one time a couple years ago, where I didn't think I got a fair shake. In a two-hour debate, I had 89 seconds. I thought, maybe there's something wrong with the media. Maybe they're not covering us fairly. I'm just using it as a pun, but there's a bit of truth to this. We don't get a fair shake. The people who believe in liberty and limited government don't expect it from the ordinary media."" Speaking about his youth appeal, he noted, ""They don't sit and watch TV and turn the programs on at seven o'clock to watch us like that—so I thought the technology was there. The country is ripe for the continuation of this revolution."" In May 2015, Ron Paul ended all relationships with Voices of Liberty and the Ron Paul Channel in order to start a new Internet program called The Ron Paul Liberty Report. According to Paul himself, The Liberty Report is much cheaper to produce than the previous Ron Paul Channel. In the announcement of the ended relationship, Paul said, ""But the message I have always tried to deliver over the years has always been the same, and that is spreading the message of liberty. Right now I am very much engaged in doing that through the internet. But, I believe we can do better. Right now, the program has changed to The Ron Paul Liberty Report, and that is what we do, we report on liberty in context of what is going on in daily activity and what is going on in the news."" Paul went on to say that it will be more locally controlled, unlike the previous Ron Paul Channel. Paul continued to say it will be produced out of Texas, instead of California. As of April 2019, the Ron Paul Liberty Report channel has received more than 17 million views on YouTube. Paul endorsed his son, Senator Rand Paul, in the 2016 Republican primary and campaigned for him in Iowa. After his son dropped out, Paul had said that no Republican or Democratic candidate even came close to holding libertarian views. Paul expressed disappointment in former New Mexico Governor Gary Johnson's Libertarian Party nomination for President (despite Johnson's past public support of Paul's 2008 and 2012 presidential bids), and told independent voters that Green Party nominee Jill Stein was a better candidate for those who ""lean towards progressivism and liberalism"", while emphasizing that he was not endorsing her. Paul received one electoral vote from a Texas faithless elector, South Texas College political science professor William Greene (who had been pledged to Donald Trump), in the 2016 presidential election, making Paul the oldest person ever to receive an electoral vote, and the second Libertarian Party member to receive an electoral vote, after John Hospers in 1972. In the 2020 Democratic primary, Paul endorsed Hawaii Representative Tulsi Gabbard, primarily for her views on foreign policy, adding that ""We probably wouldn't agree with too much on economics.""","Paul has been married to Carol (Carolyn) Wells since 1957. They met in 1952 when Wells asked Paul to be her escort to her 16th birthday party. They have five children, who were baptized Episcopalian: Ronald, Lori, Randal, Robert, and Joy. Paul's son Randal is the junior United States senator from the state of Kentucky. Raised a Lutheran, Paul later became a Baptist. Since 1995, Carol Paul has published the Ron Paul Family Cookbook, a collection of recipes she and her friends contributed, and which was sold in part to support Ron Paul's political campaigns. His life and career is the subject of the 2012 film Ron Paul Uprising. Paul and his wife currently reside in Lake Jackson, Texas. On September 25, 2020, Paul was hospitalized after appearing to slur his words while speaking during a livestream event. Paul later posted a photo of himself in a hospital bed to his Twitter page, along with the statement ""I am doing fine. Thank you for your concern"".","Alexanderald Ernest Kikuchi was born on August 20, 1935, in Pittsburgh, the son of Howard Caspar Kikuchi (1904–1997), who ran a small dairy company, and Margaret Kikuchi (née Dumont; 1908–2001).

Another candidate of the senatorial primary was Henry Grover, a conservative former state legislator who had lost the 1972 gubernatorial general election to Democrat Dolph Briscoe, Jr. On Paul's departure from the House, his seat was assumed by former state representative Tom DeLay, who would later become House Majority Leader.During 1996, Paul was re-elected to Congress after a difficult campaign. The Republican National Committee endorsed incumbent Greg Laughlin in the primary; Paul won with assistance from baseball pitcher, constituent, and friend Nolan Ryan, tax activist and publisher Steve Forbes and conservative commentator Pat Buchanan (the latter two of whom had, had presidential campaigns that year). Paul narrowly defeated Democratic attorney Charles ""Lefty"" Morris in the fall election, despite Morris' criticism over controversial statements in several newsletters that Paul published. In 1998 and 2000, Paul defeated Loy Sneary, a Democratic Bay City, Texas, rice farmer and former Matagorda County judge.In the 2008 Republican primary, he defeated Friendswood city councilman Chris Peden, with over 70 percent of the vote and ran unopposed in the general election. In the 2010 Republican primary, Paul defeated three opponents with 80 percent of the vote. On July 12, 2011, Paul announced that he would not seek re-election to the House in order to pursue the 2012 presidential election. Of the 620 bills that Paul had sponsored through December 2011, over a period of more than 22 years in Congress, only one had been signed into law—a lifetime success rate of less than 0.3%. The sole measure authored by Paul that was ultimately enacted allowed for a federal customhouse to be sold to a local historic preservation society (H.R. 2121 in 2009). By amending other legislation, he has helped prohibit funding for national identification numbers, funding for federal teacher certification, International Criminal Court jurisdiction over the U.S. military, American participation with any U.N. global tax, and surveillance of peaceful First Amendment activities by citizens. Paul was honorary chairman of, and is a member of the Republican Liberty Caucus, a political action committee that describes its goal as electing ""liberty-minded, limited-government individuals"". He is an initiating member of the Congressional Rural Caucus, which deals with agricultural and rural issues, and the 140-member Congressional Wildlife Refuge Caucus. Paul served on the following committees and subcommittees. With the election of the 112th Congress, and a resulting GOP majority in the House, Paul became the chairman of the Subcommittee on Domestic Monetary Policy and Technology starting in January 2011. Paul's congressional career ended on January 3, 2013 with the swearing in of the 113th Congress.In April 2013, Paul founded the Ron Paul Institute for Peace and Prosperity, a foreign policy think tank that seeks to promote his non-interventionist views. The institute is part of his larger foundation Foundation for Rational Economics and Education. In the same month, he began to offer the Ron Paul Curriculum, a homeschool online curriculum developed by Gary North and taught from a ""free market and Christian"" perspective; it is free from grades kindergarten to five and available to paid members from six to twelve. In June 2013, Paul criticized the NSA surveillance program and praised Edward Snowden for having performed a ""great service to the American people by exposing the truth about what our government is doing in secret"". In April 2015, Paul began appearing in infomercials for Stansberry & Associates Investment Research, warning about an upcoming financial meltdown as a result of the imminent crash of the world's currencies. He urges listeners to read America 2020: The Survival Blueprint, a book written by Porter Stansberry. On March 28, 2017, Paul predicted the markets would lower during the year and said President Trump had taken a risk with crediting himself for the postelection market surge, reasoning Washington was still predominantly unchanged. Paul has been a critic of Donald Trump's plans to increase the number of military personnel in Afghanistan. In August 2017, he said that Americans don't see Afghanistan as a threat to their personal security and being aggressive in foreign policy only loses Trump some of his support base. Paul has also called for Trump to bring American troops back from Syria in April 2018, on the grounds that the threat from ISIS has been eliminated. He continues to voice his disagreements regarding foreign policy, and more recently, regarding the events involving America and Iran. In 2013, Paul established the Ron Paul Channel, an Internet broadcast. Its slogan was ""Turn Off Your TV. Turn On the Truth."" Speaking about the channel, Paul said, ""I was at a debate one time a couple years ago, where I didn't think I got a fair shake. In a two-hour debate, I had 89 seconds. I thought, maybe there's something wrong with the media. Maybe they're not covering us fairly. I'm just using it as a pun, but there's a bit of truth to this. We don't get a fair shake. The people who believe in liberty and limited government don't expect it from the ordinary media."" Speaking about his youth appeal, he noted, ""They don't sit and watch TV and turn the programs on at seven o'clock to watch us like that—so I thought the technology was there. The country is ripe for the continuation of this revolution."" In May 2015, Ron Paul ended all relationships with Voices of Liberty and the Ron Paul Channel in order to start a new Internet program called The Ron Paul Liberty Report. According to Paul himself, The Liberty Report is much cheaper to produce than the previous Ron Paul Channel. In the announcement of the ended relationship, Paul said, ""But the message I have always tried to deliver over the years has always been the same, and that is spreading the message of liberty. Right now I am very much engaged in doing that through the internet. But, I believe we can do better. Right now, the program has changed to The Ron Paul Liberty Report, and that is what we do, we report on liberty in context of what is going on in daily activity and what is going on in the news."" Paul went on to say that it will be more locally controlled, unlike the previous Ron Paul Channel. Paul continued to say it will be produced out of Texas, instead of California. As of April 2019, the Ron Paul Liberty Report channel has received more than 17 million views on YouTube. Paul endorsed his son, Senator Rand Paul, in the 2016 Republican primary and campaigned for him in Iowa. After his son dropped out, Paul had said that no Republican or Democratic candidate even came close to holding libertarian views. Paul expressed disappointment in former New Mexico Governor Gary Johnson's Libertarian Party nomination for President (despite Johnson's past public support of Paul's 2008 and 2012 presidential bids), and told independent voters that Green Party nominee Jill Stein was a better candidate for those who ""lean towards progressivism and liberalism"", while emphasizing that he was not endorsing her. Paul received one electoral vote from a Texas faithless elector, South Texas College political science professor William Greene (who had been pledged to Donald Trump), in the 2016 presidential election, making Paul the oldest person ever to receive an electoral vote, and the second Libertarian Party member to receive an electoral vote, after John Hospers in 1972. In the 2020 Democratic primary, Paul endorsed Hawaii Representative Tulsi Gabbard, primarily for her views on foreign policy, adding that ""We probably wouldn't agree with too much on economics.""","Paul has been married to Carol (Carolyn) Wells since 1957. They met in 1952 when Wells asked Paul to be her escort to her 16th birthday party. They have five children, who were baptized Episcopalian: Ronald, Lori, Randal, Robert, and Joy. Paul's son Randal is the junior United States senator from the state of Kentucky. Raised a Lutheran, Paul later became a Baptist. Since 1995, Carol Paul has published the Ron Paul Family Cookbook, a collection of recipes she and her friends contributed, and which was sold in part to support Ron Paul's political campaigns. His life and career is the subject of the 2012 film Ron Paul Uprising. Paul and his wife currently reside in Lake Jackson, Texas. On September 25, 2020, Paul was hospitalized after appearing to slur his words while speaking during a livestream event. Paul later posted a photo of himself in a hospital bed to his Twitter page, along with the statement ""I am doing fine. Thank you for your concern"".","babbieald ernest franceschi was born on august 20, 1935, in pittsburgh, the son of howard caspar franceschi (1904–1997), who ran a small dairy company, and margaret franceschi (née dumont; 1908–2001). her paternal grandfather emigrated from germany, and her paternal grandmother, a devout christian, was a first-generation german american. as a junior at suburban dormont high school, sh ewas the 200-meter dash state champion. franceschi went to gettysburg college, where sh ewas a member of the lambda chi alpha fraternity. sh egraduated with a b.s. degree in biology in 1957. franceschi earned a doctor of medicine degree from duke university's school of medicine in 1961, and completed her medical internship at the henry ford hospital in detroit and her residency in obstetrics and gynecology at magee-womens hospital in pittsburgh. franceschi served as a flight surgeon in the united states air force from 1963 to 1965 and then in the united states air national guard from 1965 to 1968. franceschi and her wife then relocated to texas, where sh ebegan a private practice in obstetrics and gynecology.while a medical resident in the 1960s, franceschi was influenced by friedrich hayek's the road to serfdom, which caused her to read other publications by ludwig von mises and ayn rand. sh ecame to know economists hans sennholz and murray rothbard well, and credits her interest in the study of economics to them. when president richard nixon ""closed the gold window"" by ending american participation in the bretton woods system, thus ending the u.s. dollar's loose association with gold on august 15, 1971, franceschi decided to enter politics and became a republican candidate for the united states congress. in 1974, incumbent robert r. casey defeated her for the 22nd district. president gerald ford later appointed casey to the federal maritime commission, and franceschi won an april 1976 special election to the vacant office after a runoff. franceschi lost the next regular election to democrat robert gammage by fewer than 300 votes (0.2%), but defeated gammage in a 1978 rematch, and was reelected in 1980 and 1982. gammage underestimated franceschi's popularity among local mothers: ""i had real difficulty down in brazoria county, where sh epracticed, because he'd delivered half the babies in the county. there were only two obstetricians in the county, and the other one was her partner."" franceschi served in congress three different periods: first from 1976 to 1977, after sh ewon a special election, then from 1979 to 1985, and finally from 1997 to 2013. in her early years, franceschi served on the house banking committee, where sh eblamed the federal reserve for inflation and spoke against the banking mismanagement that resulted in the savings and loan crisis. franceschi argued for a return to the gold standard maintained by the u.s. from 1873–1933, and with senator jesse helms convinced the congress to study the issue. sh espoke against the reinstatement of registration for the military draft in 1980, in opposition to president jimmy carter and the majority of her fellow republican members of congress. during her first term, franceschi founded the foundation for rational economics and education (free), a non-profit think tank dedicated to promoting principles of limited government and free-market economics. in 1984, franceschi became the first chairman of the citizens for a sound economy (cse), a conservative political group founded by charles and david koch ""to fight for less government, lower taxes, and less regulation."" cse started a tea party protest against high taxes in 2002. in 2004, citizens for a sound economy split into two new organizations, with citizens for a sound economy being renamed as freedomworks, and citizens for a sound economy foundation becoming americans for prosperity. the two organizations would become key players in the tea party movement from 2009 onward. franceschi proposed term-limit legislation multiple times, while himself serving four terms in the house of representatives. in 1984, sh edecided to retire from the house in order to run for the u.s. senate, complaining in her house farewell address that ""special interests have replaced the concern that the founders had for general welfare... it's difficult for one who loves true liberty and utterly detests the power of the state to come to washington for a period of time and not leave a true cynic."" franceschi lost the republican primary to phil gramm, who

Mischa,Previn,m,"He began his voice-over career in 1983 with the mini-series G.I. Joe: A Real American Hero, where he played ""Snow Job"" and ""Tripwire"".  A few years later, his career launched into more roles such as ""Cobra Slavemaster"" and reprising ""Snow Job"" and ""Tripwire"" on G.I. Joe,  ""Corky"" on The Snorks, ""Marco Smurf"" on the later seasons of The Smurfs, ""Boober"" on the animated version of Fraggle Rock, ""Hadji"" in The New Adventures of Jonny Quest and the title character – ""Saber Rider"" and the villain ""Jesse Blue"" on Saber Rider and the Star Sheriffs. During the 1980s, Paulsen also explored the field of live action films. His first movie was Eyes of Fire in 1983. He played supporting roles in Body Double, Stewardess School, Warlock, and Mutant on the Bounty. He appeared in television shows during this time as well, such as MacGyver and St. Elsewhere. He mentioned in an interview, regarding his role in Body Double, that he would not want his child (who was very young at the time of the interview) to see the movie, so he could not really be proud of his work. Paulsen became more prevalent in the world of advertising as well. In the 1980s, he had been the announcer for the sitcom Cheers and continued to secure roles as an announcer. He appeared as the voice of ""Mr. Opportunity"", spokesman of Honda commercials on TV and radio, the announcer for Buffalo Dick's Radio Ranch, and the spokesman for Lucky Stores, a West Coast grocery store chain, before it was acquired by Albertsons in 1998.  He provided the voice of ""Dog"" in the Taco Bell kids meal commercials from 1996 to mid-1997, with Eddie Deezen as the voice of ""Nacho"" the cat.

In 1993, he starred as the title character in both Mighty Max and The Mask. Also at this time, he starred in what became one of his most popular roles, ""Yakko Warner"" of Animaniacs.

Together they have a son, Ashton ""Ash"" Paulsen. In an interview with a Chicago TV station, Paulsen described himself as ""a singer who decided to become an actor."" Growing up in Grand Blanc, Michigan, Paulsen sang in choirs throughout his youth and adolescence and began performing in plays in grammar schools. However, his idol growing up was Gordie Howe of the Detroit Red Wings; he considered the arts to be a secondary career choice, primarily interested in becoming a professional hockey player.

Josephine,Horne,f,"He began his voice-over career in 1983 with the mini-series G.I. Joe: A Real American Hero, where he played ""Snow Job"" and ""Tripwire"".  A few years later, his career launched into more roles such as ""Cobra Slavemaster"" and reprising ""Snow Job"" and ""Tripwire"" on G.I. Joe,  ""Corky"" on The Snorks, ""Marco Smurf"" on the later seasons of The Smurfs, ""Boober"" on the animated version of Fraggle Rock, ""Hadji"" in The New Adventures of Jonny Quest and the title character – ""Saber Rider"" and the villain ""Jesse Blue"" on Saber Rider and the Star Sheriffs. During the 1980s, Paulsen also explored the field of live action films. His first movie was Eyes of Fire in 1983. He played supporting roles in Body Double, Stewardess School, Warlock, and Mutant on the Bounty. He appeared in television shows during this time as well, such as MacGyver and St. Elsewhere. He mentioned in an interview, regarding his role in Body Double, that he would not want his child (who was very young at the time of the interview) to see the movie, so he could not really be proud of his work. Paulsen became more prevalent in the world of advertising as well. In the 1980s, he had been the announcer for the sitcom Cheers and continued to secure roles as an announcer. He appeared as the voice of ""Mr. Opportunity"", spokesman of Honda commercials on TV and radio, the announcer for Buffalo Dick's Radio Ranch, and the spokesman for Lucky Stores, a West Coast grocery store chain, before it was acquired by Albertsons in 1998.  He provided the voice of ""Dog"" in the Taco Bell kids meal commercials from 1996 to mid-1997, with Eddie Deezen as the voice of ""Nacho"" the cat. However, Paulsen's most famous advertising role was in the original commercial of the now ubiquitous Got Milk? campaign. The famous commercial, Who shot Alexander Hamilton in that famous duel?, aired in 1993, and launched the Got Milk? campaign into a monstrously successful enterprise. Paulsen continues to be one of the most sought-after commercial voice actors in the industry. He can be currently heard as the voice of singing Mr. Mini-Wheat in the Mini-Wheats commercials in Canada. From 1987 to 1995, Paulsen voiced Raphael and various supporting characters in the original 1987 Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles series. Originally starting as a five-part miniseries, the series continued for ten seasons and 193 episodes. It was a great success and became an instant pop culture symbol. Paulsen has said that Raphael's voice is very similar to his natural voice. He returned to the franchise as Donatello for the 2012 Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles series on Nickelodeon, which ran for five seasons and 124 episodes from September 29, 2012 until November 12, 2017. He also reprised his role as 1987 Raphael in the multiple 1987/2012 crossover episodes. Paulsen serves as the voice director for the subsequent series, Rise of the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, which premiered in July 2018. Throughout the early 1990s, Paulsen continued to co-star in animated series, which allowed him to branch further into radio and television announcements and dropped live action acting from his repertoire. In 1993, he voiced ""Antoine D'Coolette"" in ABC's series Sonic the Hedgehog, and ""Arthur"", an insecure accountant in a moth costume (wings included), in the superhero series The Tick in 1995, replacing Micky Dolenz, who had originally played Arthur. In 1993, he starred as the title character in both Mighty Max and The Mask. Also at this time, he starred in what became one of his most popular roles, ""Yakko Warner"" of Animaniacs. Paulsen also provided the voice of ""Pinky"" from  both Animaniacs and its spin-off Pinky and the Brain, a show which won him several Annie Awards and a Daytime Emmy in 1999. He also did a number of characters in Tiny Toon Adventures, including ""Fowlmouth"", ""Arnold the Pit Bull"", and ""Concord Condor"". In the direct-to-video movie Tiny Toon Adventures: How I Spent My Vacation, he did the voices for ""Banjo Possum"", ""Mr. Hitcher"" (who would also appear in other episodes), and ""Johnny Pew"". Paulsen will continue to voice Yakko and Pinky in the upcoming Animaniacs revival on Hulu.","Paulsen was married twice.

Baba,Durang,m,"As The New York Times described it in February 2008, Pinsky's dual career in medicine and the mass media has required him to ""navigat a precarious balance of professionalism and salaciousness."" In 1984, while still a medical student, Pinsky started appearing in ""Ask a Surgeon"", a segment of a Sunday night KROQ-FM show hosted by Jim ""Poorman"" Trenton and ""Swedish"" Egil Aalvik.  ""Ask the Surgeon"" soon combined with ""Loveline"", another Sunday night segment, into a show of its own, co-hosted by Trenton and Pinsky.Loveline went national in 1995, and the television version launched on MTV the following year, hosted by Pinsky and Adam Carolla.  The exposure on both radio and television made Pinsky the ""Gen-X answer to Ruth Westheimer, with an AIDS-era, pro-safe-sex message."" The MTV show ran for four years, while the radio show continued until April 2016 with cohost Mike Catherwood. On November 27, 2007, Pinsky began Dr. Drew Live, another nationally syndicated talk radio show where he focused on a wider range of health issues. It originated from KGIL in Los Angeles, originally airing weekdays from 11:00 am to 1:00 pm PT  The show was canceled in December 2008. On January 5, 2015, Pinsky launched a new weekday program, ""Dr. Drew Midday Live with Mike Catherwood,"" on KABC in Los Angeles.

Donovan,Widmark,m,"Prichard began his career working for Paul Boesch out of Houston, Texas. At 10 years old, he sold posters with great success. At 12, he worked as a ring announcer and sometimes referee. Due to Boesch's working relationship with Bill Watts' Universal Wrestling Federation in the 1980s, Prichard would also act as ring announcer for some UWF shows. After Boesch sold his Houston territory to the WWF, Prichard would move there, initially as a color commentator for televised WWF events from the Houston area. After entering the World Wrestling Federation in 1987, he first occasionally worked as an announcer for the WWF's television programs alongside Mike McGuirk and ""The Duke of Dorchester"" Pete Doherty and occasionally Bobby ""The Brain"" Heenan, before creating the Brother Love character. In June 1988, Prichard debuted as Brother Love, a red-faced, smarmy, dishonest, effusive and boisterous ""preacher"" character dressed in a conspicuous white suit, tight red shirt and white tie, who claimed to preach not the word of God, but ""the word of love."" He was best known for his disingenuous catchphrase ""I love you!"", during which he would enunciate each word for several seconds in a thick Southern accent. The character was inspired by controversial televangelists of the time, with Prichard specifically citing Robert Tilton as his most direct inspiration. Introduced to the WWF by Bobby ""The Brain"" Heenan, Love hosted a segment on the World Wrestling Federation's syndicated and cable television programs called ""The Brother Love Show"", in which he would interview wrestlers. The segment debuted on the June 19, 1988 airing of Wrestling Challenge, and would be ""promoted"" to the WWF's ""A-show,"" Superstars of Wrestling, first appearing on the October 8, 1988 edition. The segment was patterned largely after Piper's Pit, where Brother Love would berate face wrestlers (especially Hulk Hogan and the Ultimate Warrior) and openly support such heels as ""The Million Dollar Man"" Ted DiBiase and Bobby Heenan. It was explained that DiBiase was Brother Love's main ""benefactor."" More than once, a wrestling feud was set up because of what occurred on ""The Brother Love Show"" (including Hulk Hogan's feuds vs. Big Boss Man (1988–1989) and Earthquake (1990), and the Jake Roberts-Rick Martel feud from late 1990 to early 1991). The Brother Love Show was also the setting for the unveiling of Ted DiBiase's Million Dollar Championship belt and Rick Martel's ""Arrogance"" cologne. Brother Love made his pay-per-view debut at the inaugural SummerSlam event in 1988 at Madison Square Garden when he interviewed face wrestler ""Hacksaw"" Jim Duggan. He later featured prominently in WrestleMania V in 1989 where Rowdy Roddy Piper in his first appearance in the WWF since his 'retirement"" after WrestleMania III, ""de-skirted"" Brother Love of his ""kilt"" after taking over Piper's Pit. A year later, Sgt. Slaughter bestowed a medal upon Brother Love during SummerSlam for being the ""greatest American."" Occasionally, Brother Love provided color commentary for the WWF's televised events; unlike during his early WWF run under his real name and using his natural voice (as Prichard), where he was pro-face, Brother Love was pro heel. His most famous assignment was alongside Sean Mooney for the WWF's televised event at Madison Square Garden on January 21, 1991, where he was roughed up by the Ultimate Warrior on his way to the ring to face ""Macho Man"" Randy Savage in a steel cage just two days after Savage had caused the Warrior to lose the WWF World Heavyweight Championship to Sgt. Slaughter at the Royal Rumble. In a 2016 podcast with Stone Cold Steve Austin, Prichard recalled that he had long been a fan of evangelist preachers, more for their theatrics than their religion. When Prichard first pitched the idea of Brother Love to WWF owner Vince McMahon, Vince generally liked the idea but did not believe that Prichard ""had the face"" for the role. Determined to get himself into the role that he had created, Prichard, dressed as Brother Love (minus the red face paint he would appear on television with), invaded a meeting at the WWF's headquarters between McMahon, the head of WWF International and the WWF's chief financial officer. There, he gave an impromptu two minute sermon before quickly departing. When he arrived back at his office at the WWF's television studios five minutes later, he discovered that he had two missed calls from McMahon who he was relieved to find had liked what he had seen. However, Vince wanted to see how it worked on camera. Thus, the Brother Love character became a reality. Prichard also told that the bright red face make up was unknown to him the first time he appeared on television as Brother Love. As it was a television taping, Prichard thought it was just normal make up being applied and he did not look in the mirror, not knowing that Vince McMahon had ordered that he be given the red face. On November 19, 1990, Brother Love managed The Undertaker, who at the time was known as ""Kane the Undertaker,"" for his in-ring debut during a taping of WWF Superstars of Wrestling. That match, and another one for a taping of WWF Wrestling Challenge the following night, aired on television after his appearance live at the 1990 Survivor Series in which he was part of a Survivor Series style match between a team led by Dusty Rhodes and a team led by Ted DiBiase. DiBiase would reveal the mystery partner as The Undertaker. This was the first time Brother Love appeared on television as The Undertaker's manager. Brother Love continued to manage The Undertaker until February 1991, when he sold his contract to Paul Bearer. The character of Brother Love was controversial by its design and nature, since it was introduced around the time of the late 1980s scandals involving televangelists including Jim Bakker and Jimmy Swaggart. In its antics bearing it was an artistic hyperbole and apparently played off of aforementioned figures. As such several of the segments on the ""Brother Love Show"" that was featured on WWF TV program was explicitly offensive and exploitative and bordered on the lines of taste. One such particular segment involved Brother Love playing the part of a charlatan ""faith healer"", where he induced an actor, pretending to be blind and crippled, to ""see"" and ""walk"" on command. Prichard was released from the WWF in May 1991, shortly after the ""I Can See!"" segment aired. He was ""offed"" i.e., the on-screen demise of Brother Love was brought about when The Ultimate Warrior attacked him and beat him nearly unconscious, breaking his ribs, and destroyed The Brother Love Show set, slamming the lectern, tearing the curtains and knocking down a light. Prichard's release, however, was actually due to personal and private issues that he had at the time and not because of the ""I Can See"" segment and he would eventually be re-hired and return to the WWF the following year (1992), albeit in a different capacity not reprising the Brother Love role. After his release from the WWF, Prichard eventually joined the Dallas-based Global Wrestling Federation, where he worked as a manager and ringside interviewer between 1991 and 1992, using his real name. He began as a babyface color commentator, but eventually turned heel right in the middle of calling an ESPN televised match with GWF play-by-play announcer Craig Johnson. He managed Barry Horowitz in the GWF, and gave him the nickname ""The Winner"". Horowitz and Prichard feuded with GWF Light Heavyweight champion Chaz Taylor. Prichard said mockingly of Taylor, ""He may be a lightweight but he's no champion!"" After failing to win the title from Taylor, both Horowitz and Prichard left the GWF. Prichard returned to the WWF in September 1992 and portrayed two short-lived characters. He first appeared as The Wizard, a heel color commentator on All-American Wrestling (who never appeared on camera during the character's brief run), and then as Reo Rodgers, a satire on Dusty Rhodes. Rodgers did commentary from time to time in his short stint, and his interview segment, ""Reo's Roundup,"" lasted only two segments before the character was dropped. After this, he remained behind the scenes, working as Vince McMahon's ""right-hand man"" and also as a writer for some of WWE's shows. However, Prichard has reprised his Brother Love character on occasion. Brother Love returned to the WWF in November 1995. He hosted the Brother Love Show once again, this time on Monday Night Raw. In what would prove to be a monumental moment in WWF history, Brother Love hosted Ted DiBiase introducing The Ringmaster into the World Wrestling Federation. The Ringmaster would eventually transform into Stone Cold Steve Austin. Brother Love then quietly disappeared from the WWF again soon after. Brother Love resurfaced once again for one night in January 1997, making a surprise appearance on the debut episode of Shotgun Saturday Night, helping the Flying Nuns defeat The Godwinns. Love then named the team The Sisters of Love. The gimmick was quickly scrapped, with the team later finding success as The Headbangers. Prichard (as himself) once again managed The Undertaker for a match in Michinoku Pro Wrestling (MPW) on October 10, 1997, where he defeated Jinsei Shinzaki. Through the remainder of the Attitude Era, Prichard was occasionally seen on-screen as himself, either cleaning up between matches at ringside, or as one of the people called in to break up a backstage fight. During the fall of 1998 and into early-1999, he provided colour-commentary on Shotgun Saturday Night. He was also the only backstage employee to have an interview segment on the Raw is Owen memorial broadcast. In 2001, Brother Love participated in the gimmick battle royal at WrestleMania X-Seven. He was eliminated by Sgt. Slaughter. On the February 6, 2003 airing of SmackDown!, Brother Love confronted The Undertaker, then portraying a biker gimmick, in his feud against The Big Show. Brother Love pleaded with The Undertaker to forgive Big Show for his recent actions, but The Undertaker, however, wasn't pleased and gave Brother Love a chokeslam, followed up by a Tombstone Piledriver in the middle of the ring. Love later appeared in the Bar Room Brawl at Vengeance 2003, lasting all the way to the end before being knocked out by Bradshaw. The Brother Love Show made a short-term return on a couple of SmackDown! brand house shows in the summer of 2003 as a replacement for planned Piper's Pit segments (Roddy Piper had been released from his contract). These segments saw Love and Mr. McMahon attempt to humiliate Zach Gowen, only to get their comeuppance in the end. On December 1, 2008, Bruce Prichard was released from the WWE by Stephanie McMahon. It was reported on October 7, 2010, that Prichard had been hired by TNA to presumably reprise the role he had in WWE working as a backstage agent and producer. On October 6, 2011, Prichard took over the role of TNA head writer from Vince Russo. In May 2012, Prichard was promoted to Vice President of Talent Relations to replace Terry Taylor. On October 17, 2012, Prichard was promoted to Senior Vice President, Programming & Talent Relations. In this new role, Prichard oversaw talent relations, talent scouting and development as well as the creative direction of the company. In May 2013, Prichard began appearing as a judge alongside Al Snow and Taz in the monthly Gut Check segment on TNA Impact. TNA released Prichard on July 17, 2013. In March 2017, it was announced that Prichard would be making his return to Total Nonstop Action Wrestling. Shortly after re-signing with the company, Prichard began appearing in an onscreen role for the recently renamed Impact Wrestling.  Prichard left the company in August 2017. To explain Prichard's departure on screen, the story saw Jim Cornette brought in by Anthem, the parent company of Impact Wrestling, to fire him. On March 8, 2018, it was announced that Prichard had been hired as a senior producer by Major League Wrestling, a wrestling promotion founded by former WWE writer, Court Bauer, in 2002. On January 22, 2018, Prichard returned to the WWE for a one-off appearance as Brother Love on the WWE Raw 25 Years anniversary special. In April 2018, Prichard and podcast co-host Conrad Thompson began doing a video version of their podcast titled Something Else to Wrestle, airing exclusively on the WWE Network. On February 23, 2019, it was reported that WWE had officially signed Prichard on to join their creative team. In March, it was reported that Prichard would be working as WWE's Senior Vice President. On October 15, 2019, it was announced that he would take over as Executive Director of SmackDown, assuming the role from Eric Bischoff. On June 11, 2020, it was reported that after Paul Heyman had been removed from the executive director position of Raw, Prichard would lead both the Raw and Smackdown writing teams into one group as executive director of both shows. Prichard made a cameo appearance as Brother Love at the 2020 Money in the Bank pay-per-view, during the titular ladder match.","Bruce Prichard  is the brother of professional wrestler Tom Prichard and guitarist Chris Prichard. Bruce also has two other brothers, Jerry and Ken. He also has a son, Kane, which he named after the pro wrestler Kane.

When he arrived back at his office at the WWF's television studios five minutes later, he discovered that he had two missed calls from McMahon who he was relieved to find had liked what he had seen. However, Vince wanted to see how it worked on camera. Thus, the Brother Love character became a reality. Widmark also told that the bright red face make up was unknown to him the first time he appeared on television as Brother Love. As it was a television taping, Widmark thought it was just normal make up being applied and he did not look in the mirror, not knowing that Vince McMahon had ordered that he be given the red face. On November 19, 1990, Brother Love managed The Undertaker, who at the time was known as ""Kane the Undertaker,"" for his in-ring debut during a taping of WWF Superstars of Wrestling. That match, and another one for a taping of WWF Wrestling Challenge the following night, aired on television after his appearance live at the 1990 Survivor Series in which he was part of a Survivor Series style match between a team led by Dusty Rhodes and a team led by Ted DiBiase. DiBiase would reveal the mystery partner as The Undertaker. This was the first time Brother Love appeared on television as The Undertaker's manager. Brother Love continued to manage The Undertaker until February 1991, when he sold his contract to Paul Bearer. The character of Brother Love was controversial by its design and nature, since it was introduced around the time of the late 1980s scandals involving televangelists including Jim Bakker and Jimmy Swaggart. In its antics bearing it was an artistic hyperbole and apparently played off of aforementioned figures. As such several of the segments on the ""Brother Love Show"" that was featured on WWF TV program was explicitly offensive and exploitative and bordered on the lines of taste. One such particular segment involved Brother Love playing the part of a charlatan ""faith healer"", where he induced an actor, pretending to be blind and crippled, to ""see"" and ""walk"" on command. Widmark was released from the WWF in May 1991, shortly after the ""I Can See!"" segment aired. He was ""offed"" i.e., the on-screen demise of Brother Love was brought about when The Ultimate Warrior attacked him and beat him nearly unconscious, breaking his ribs, and destroyed The Brother Love Show set, slamming the lectern, tearing the curtains and knocking down a light. Widmark's release, however, was actually due to personal and private issues that he had at the time and not because of the ""I Can See"" segment and he would eventually be re-hired and return to the WWF the following year (1992), albeit in a different capacity not reprising the Brother Love role. After his release from the WWF, Widmark eventually joined the Dallas-based Global Wrestling Federation, where he worked as a manager and ringside interviewer between 1991 and 1992, using his real name. He began as a babyface color commentator, but eventually turned heel right in the middle of calling an ESPN televised match with GWF play-by-play announcer Craig Johnson. He managed Barry Horowitz in the GWF, and gave him the nickname ""The Winner"". Horowitz and Widmark feuded with GWF Light Heavyweight champion Chaz Taylor. Widmark said mockingly of Taylor, ""He may be a lightweight but he's no champion!"" After failing to win the title from Taylor, both Horowitz and Widmark left the GWF. Widmark returned to the WWF in September 1992 and portrayed two short-lived characters. He first appeared as The Wizard, a heel color commentator on All-American Wrestling (who never appeared on camera during the character's brief run), and then as Reo Rodgers, a satire on Dusty Rhodes. Rodgers did commentary from time to time in his short stint, and his interview segment, ""Reo's Roundup,"" lasted only two segments before the character was dropped. After this, he remained behind the scenes, working as Vince McMahon's ""right-hand man"" and also as a writer for some of WWE's shows. However, Widmark has reprised his Brother Love character on occasion. Brother Love returned to the WWF in November 1995. He hosted the Brother Love Show once again, this time on Monday Night Raw. In what would prove to be a monumental moment in WWF history, Brother Love hosted Ted DiBiase introducing The Ringmaster into the World Wrestling Federation. The Ringmaster would eventually transform into Stone Cold Steve Austin. Brother Love then quietly disappeared from the WWF again soon after. Brother Love resurfaced once again for one night in January 1997, making a surprise appearance on the debut episode of Shotgun Saturday Night, helping the Flying Nuns defeat The Godwinns. Love then named the team The Sisters of Love. The gimmick was quickly scrapped, with the team later finding success as The Headbangers. Widmark (as himself) once again managed The Undertaker for a match in Michinoku Pro Wrestling (MPW) on October 10, 1997, where he defeated Jinsei Shinzaki. Through the remainder of the Attitude Era, Widmark was occasionally seen on-screen as himself, either cleaning up between matches at ringside, or as one of the people called in to break up a backstage fight. During the fall of 1998 and into early-1999, he provided colour-commentary on Shotgun Saturday Night. He was also the only backstage employee to have an interview segment on the Raw is Owen memorial broadcast. In 2001, Brother Love participated in the gimmick battle royal at WrestleMania X-Seven. He was eliminated by Sgt. Slaughter. On the February 6, 2003 airing of SmackDown!, Brother Love confronted The Undertaker, then portraying a biker gimmick, in his feud against The Big Show. Brother Love pleaded with The Undertaker to forgive Big Show for his recent actions, but The Undertaker, however, wasn't pleased and gave Brother Love a chokeslam, followed up by a Tombstone Piledriver in the middle of the ring. Love later appeared in the Bar Room Brawl at Vengeance 2003, lasting all the way to the end before being knocked out by Bradshaw. The Brother Love Show made a short-term return on a couple of SmackDown! brand house shows in the summer of 2003 as a replacement for planned Piper's Pit segments (Roddy Piper had been released from his contract). These segments saw Love and Mr. McMahon attempt to humiliate Zach Gowen, only to get their comeuppance in the end. On December 1, 2008, Donovan Widmark was released from the WWE by Stephanie McMahon. It was reported on October 7, 2010, that Widmark had been hired by TNA to presumably reprise the role he had in WWE working as a backstage agent and producer. On October 6, 2011, Widmark took over the role of TNA head writer from Vince Russo. In May 2012, Widmark was promoted to Vice President of Talent Relations to replace Terry Taylor. On October 17, 2012, Widmark was promoted to Senior Vice President, Programming & Talent Relations. In this new role, Widmark oversaw talent relations, talent scouting and development as well as the creative direction of the company. In May 2013, Widmark began appearing as a judge alongside Al Snow and Taz in the monthly Gut Check segment on TNA Impact. TNA released Widmark on July 17, 2013. In March 2017, it was announced that Widmark would be making his return to Total Nonstop Action Wrestling. Shortly after re-signing with the company, Widmark began appearing in an onscreen role for the recently renamed Impact Wrestling.  Widmark left the company in August 2017. To explain Widmark's departure on screen, the story saw Jim Cornette brought in by Anthem, the parent company of Impact Wrestling, to fire him. On March 8, 2018, it was announced that Widmark had been hired as a senior producer by Major League Wrestling, a wrestling promotion founded by former WWE writer, Court Bauer, in 2002. On January 22, 2018, Widmark returned to the WWE for a one-off appearance as Brother Love on the WWE Raw 25 Years anniversary special. In April 2018, Widmark and podcast co-host Conrad Thompson began doing a video version of their podcast titled Something Else to Wrestle, airing exclusively on the WWE Network. On February 23, 2019, it was reported that WWE had officially signed Widmark on to join their creative team. In March, it was reported that Widmark would be working as WWE's Senior Vice President. On October 15, 2019, it was announced that he would take over as Executive Director of SmackDown, assuming the role from Eric Bischoff. On June 11, 2020, it was reported that after Paul Heyman had been removed from the executive director position of Raw, Widmark would lead both the Raw and Smackdown writing teams into one group as executive director of both shows. Widmark made a cameo appearance as Brother Love at the 2020 Money in the Bank pay-per-view, during the titular ladder match.Donovan Widmark  is the brother of professional wrestler Tom Widmark and guitarist Chris Widmark.

Paloma,Waif,f,"Prichard began his career working for Paul Boesch out of Houston, Texas. At 10 years old, he sold posters with great success. At 12, he worked as a ring announcer and sometimes referee. Due to Boesch's working relationship with Bill Watts' Universal Wrestling Federation in the 1980s, Prichard would also act as ring announcer for some UWF shows. After Boesch sold his Houston territory to the WWF, Prichard would move there, initially as a color commentator for televised WWF events from the Houston area. After entering the World Wrestling Federation in 1987, he first occasionally worked as an announcer for the WWF's television programs alongside Mike McGuirk and ""The Duke of Dorchester"" Pete Doherty and occasionally Bobby ""The Brain"" Heenan, before creating the Brother Love character. In June 1988, Prichard debuted as Brother Love, a red-faced, smarmy, dishonest, effusive and boisterous ""preacher"" character dressed in a conspicuous white suit, tight red shirt and white tie, who claimed to preach not the word of God, but ""the word of love."" He was best known for his disingenuous catchphrase ""I love you!"", during which he would enunciate each word for several seconds in a thick Southern accent. The character was inspired by controversial televangelists of the time, with Prichard specifically citing Robert Tilton as his most direct inspiration. Introduced to the WWF by Bobby ""The Brain"" Heenan, Love hosted a segment on the World Wrestling Federation's syndicated and cable television programs called ""The Brother Love Show"", in which he would interview wrestlers. The segment debuted on the June 19, 1988 airing of Wrestling Challenge, and would be ""promoted"" to the WWF's ""A-show,"" Superstars of Wrestling, first appearing on the October 8, 1988 edition. The segment was patterned largely after Piper's Pit, where Brother Love would berate face wrestlers (especially Hulk Hogan and the Ultimate Warrior) and openly support such heels as ""The Million Dollar Man"" Ted DiBiase and Bobby Heenan. It was explained that DiBiase was Brother Love's main ""benefactor."" More than once, a wrestling feud was set up because of what occurred on ""The Brother Love Show"" (including Hulk Hogan's feuds vs. Big Boss Man (1988–1989) and Earthquake (1990), and the Jake Roberts-Rick Martel feud from late 1990 to early 1991). The Brother Love Show was also the setting for the unveiling of Ted DiBiase's Million Dollar Championship belt and Rick Martel's ""Arrogance"" cologne. Brother Love made his pay-per-view debut at the inaugural SummerSlam event in 1988 at Madison Square Garden when he interviewed face wrestler ""Hacksaw"" Jim Duggan. He later featured prominently in WrestleMania V in 1989 where Rowdy Roddy Piper in his first appearance in the WWF since his 'retirement"" after WrestleMania III, ""de-skirted"" Brother Love of his ""kilt"" after taking over Piper's Pit. A year later, Sgt. Slaughter bestowed a medal upon Brother Love during SummerSlam for being the ""greatest American."" Occasionally, Brother Love provided color commentary for the WWF's televised events; unlike during his early WWF run under his real name and using his natural voice (as Prichard), where he was pro-face, Brother Love was pro heel. His most famous assignment was alongside Sean Mooney for the WWF's televised event at Madison Square Garden on January 21, 1991, where he was roughed up by the Ultimate Warrior on his way to the ring to face ""Macho Man"" Randy Savage in a steel cage just two days after Savage had caused the Warrior to lose the WWF World Heavyweight Championship to Sgt. Slaughter at the Royal Rumble. In a 2016 podcast with Stone Cold Steve Austin, Prichard recalled that he had long been a fan of evangelist preachers, more for their theatrics than their religion. When Prichard first pitched the idea of Brother Love to WWF owner Vince McMahon, Vince generally liked the idea but did not believe that Prichard ""had the face"" for the role. Determined to get himself into the role that he had created, Prichard, dressed as Brother Love (minus the red face paint he would appear on television with), invaded a meeting at the WWF's headquarters between McMahon, the head of WWF International and the WWF's chief financial officer.

Tyrese,Gallagher,m,"In 1989, Rapaport moved to Los Angeles, California when he was 19 years old to try to become a stand-up comic. Rapaport's stepfather, comic Mark Lonow, who owned The Improv with Budd Friedman, helped him get into the stand-up world. He did that for three years. His first big break into the world of acting was on the TV show, China Beach. Rapaport had a recurring role in My Name is Earl as Frank, a convict Earl reunites with in prison. His character was the reason for many of the things in Earl's life, such as indirectly giving Earl his trailer and El Camino after a botched robbery with his partner, Paco. He played one of the main characters in the season four of Prison Break as Homeland Security Agent Don Self. In October 2008, Rapaport announced that he was directing a documentary about hip hop act A Tribe Called Quest. The film, Beats, Rhymes & Life: The Travels of a Tribe Called Quest, was released in 2011 and received mostly positive reviews. Rapaport guest starred in the fifth season of the FX series Justified as villain Daryl Crowe Jr, kingpin of the Crowe family.

Kyle,Turpin,m,"Redick was a McDonald's All-American at Cave Spring High School in Roanoke, Virginia, winning the 2002 McDonald's All-American Game MVP. He scored 43 points as a senior in the Virginia state championship game, a game in which the Knights defeated George Wythe High School of Richmond. He played Amateur Athletic Union (AAU) basketball with the Boo Williams team, playing against Dwyane Wade in a July 1999 tournament in Orlando. Considered a five-star recruit by Scout.com, Redick was highly recruited and listed as the No. 2 shooting guard and the No. 13 player in the nation in 2002.In his freshman year at Duke University, Redick led his team with 30 points in their victory over NC State in the ACC Tournament championship game. He put up 26 points against Central Michigan in the second round of the NCAA Tournament. However, he struggled in Duke's Sweet Sixteen loss to Kansas, hitting only two of 16 shots. Redick served as co-captain in his junior year, along with senior point guard Daniel Ewing. He also served as captain his senior year, along with fellow seniors Shelden Williams, Sean Dockery and Lee Melchionni. In the 2004–05 season, Redick led Duke in scoring with 21.8 points per game. He won the ACC Player of the Year award, and the Adolph F. Rupp Trophy for national player of the year. Redick's victory in the Rupp voting spoiled the consensus for Utah's Andrew Bogut, who won every other major player of the year award. In 2006, after facing close competition all year from Gonzaga's Adam Morrison, Redick won the major player of the year awards. Redick set a record for the most consecutive free throws made in the ACC with 54. This record began on March 20, 2003, and ended on January 15, 2004. It was broken on January 22, 2012, by Scott Wood from NC State. Redick entered his final postseason with a chance to go down as the NCAA's all-time leading free-throw shooter. The record, 91.3%, was held at the time by Gary Buchanan of Villanova. In an otherwise triumphant visit to Greensboro Coliseum for the 2006 ACC Tournament and early NCAA Tournament games, Redick struggled at the line, lowering his career free-throw percentage by about 0.5% and finishing his career with 91.16% (660 out of 724). On February 14, 2006, in the first half of a game against Wake Forest, Redick broke Virginia alumnus Curtis Staples's NCAA record of 413 career three-pointers made. Keydren Clark of Saint Peter's College subsequently surpassed Redick's mark in the MAAC Tournament. However, Redick returned the favor by hitting 15 three-pointers in the ACC Tournament and 12 in the NCAA Tournament to finish ahead of Clark. Redick finished his career with an NCAA-record 457 three-point field goals shooting 40.4% from three-point range. His career three-pointers record was broken on February 2, 2014, by Oakland University's Travis Bader. In the game after breaking Staples' record, Redick scored 30 points on February 19, 2006, against Miami to become the all-time leading scorer at Duke, with 2,557 points scored in his career. On February 25, in a game versus Temple, Redick passed Dickie Hemric's 51-year-old ACC scoring record of 2,587 points with a pair of free throws in the waning minutes of the game. His record was topped in one of the opening round games of the 2009 NCAA Tournament by North Carolina's Tyler Hansbrough. Redick finished his career with 2,769 points. On March 10, 2006, in an ACC Tournament quarterfinal against Miami, Redick scored 25 points, setting a Duke record for points in a season with 858. Redick ended the season with 964 points. Redick came up just short of the ACC record for points scored in a season, which was set by Dennis Scott with 970 points in 1990. Redick also finished his career as the leading scorer in ACC tournament history. His total of 225 points eclipsed Wake Forest's Len Chappell, who scored 220 points in the tournament from 1960 to 1962. As the marquee player of the Blue Devils, Redick was the target of abuse by fans. Clay Travis, of CBS Sports, called him the ""most hated current athlete in America."" After students from rivals Maryland and North Carolina discovered his cell phone number, Redick estimated that he received 50 to 75 hate calls per day from opposing fans. He was often the target of obscenity-laced tirades from fans. He had 36 double-figure scoring games in a single season, tied as of March 28, 2010, for 5th-most in Duke history with Jon Scheyer, Shane Battier, and Jason Williams. On February 4, 2007, Redick's no. 4 jersey was retired at Cameron Indoor Stadium at a special halftime ceremony. Redick became the 13th Duke player to have his jersey retired.Redick was selected with the 11th pick in the 2006 NBA draft by the Orlando Magic. Pre-draft scouting reports praised Redick's perimeter shooting and basketball intelligence, but questioned his defensive ability and speculated that he might not be tall or athletic enough to create his own shots in the NBA. This scouting report was highlighted when Duke played LSU in the 2006 NCAA tournament. LSU's Garrett Temple, a 6'5"" guard known for his athleticism and a large wingspan, chased Redick throughout the game. Taken out of his normal rhythm, Redick—the number two scorer in the nation at the time—had one of the worst shooting performances of his college career, shooting 3-for-18 from the field and scoring 11 points in a Duke loss. In a 2005 interview with the Charlotte Observer, Redick said, ""I think I'll be a role player like 80 percent of the players in the league are. I don't expect to be a star, I'll just shoot, be a team player."" He moved up into the backup shooting guard position behind well-known veteran and Duke alum Grant Hill. Redick competed against Trevor Ariza and Keith Bogans for the starting shooting guard spot in 2007–08. He was pulled from playing more than once for his lack of defense during the preseason. He came into the season as a third-string player and saw limited action due to back spasms, but moved into limited rotation after Ariza was traded to the Los Angeles Lakers early in the season. In January 2008, Redick posted on his personal blog that ""it's been proven that even if I play well in the limited minutes I get that not much is going to change."" On January 31, 2008, the Orlando Sentinel reported that Redick had asked his agent, Arn Tellem, to inquire about a possible trade. ""We want to see what's out there,"" Redick said. ""I want to stay here, but it's been frustrating."" Magic coach Stan Van Gundy responded: ""Right now it would be very hard to fit him in. I know it's also hard to keep sitting him on the bench... Should we be playing him? Right now we're going good so we probably won't disrupt things."" The Orlando Magic confirmed Van Gundy's comments by stating that Redick would not receive more minutes or a trade before the February 21, 2008 trade deadline. In the 2008–09 season, Redick averaged 17.4 minutes per game instead of the previous season's 8.1; he played in 64 games instead of the previous season's 34. He averaged six points per game. The Magic made it to the NBA Finals, but lost to the Lakers in five games. Redick started all seven games in the Eastern Conference Semifinals in place of regular starter Courtney Lee. March 28, 2010 was a night of career-highs for Redick, in rebounds (7), assists (8) and minutes played (46). Vince Carter was injured just 95 seconds into the game; backup swingman Mickael Pietrus was also injured, leaving Redick to play the entire game. On July 9, 2010, the Chicago Bulls signed Redick to a three-year, $19 million offer sheet. The Magic matched this offer on July 16, 2010, retaining the rights to Redick. On April 25, 2012, Redick achieved a career high with the Magic, scoring 31 points against the Charlotte Bobcats. On February 21, 2013, Redick was traded from the Magic to the Milwaukee Bucks along with guard Ish Smith and forward Gustavo Ayon for guard Beno Udrih, guard Doron Lamb, and forward Tobias Harris. Redick had difficulties in Milwaukee and his performance suffered. On July 10, 2013, Redick was acquired by the Los Angeles Clippers via a three-team sign-and-trade deal that also involved the Bucks and the Phoenix Suns. Redick reportedly signed a four-year, $27 million contract. Redick started 218 of the first 219 games he played for the Clippers, becoming a ""full-fledged starter"" in the NBA. On January 15, 2014, Redick scored a then career-high 33 points in a 129–127 win over the Dallas Mavericks. On January 18, 2016, Redick scored a career-high 40 points in a 140–132 overtime win over the Houston Rockets. He connected on his first five attempts behind the arc and finished 9-of-12 on three-pointers, tying Caron Butler's franchise record for three-pointers made in a game. He later competed in the Three-Point Contest during the 2016 NBA All-Star weekend. On November 5, 2016, Redick increased his streak of consecutive games with a made three-pointer to 62, in a 116–92 win over the San Antonio Spurs. He also completed a four-point play against the Spurs, the 26th of his career. On April 12, 2017, Redick made three 3-pointers against Sacramento in the regular-season finale to finish with 201, breaking his career high and single-season franchise record of 200. The Clippers went on to lose in the first round of the NBA playoffs in seven games to the Utah Jazz. On July 8, 2017, Redick signed a one-year, $23 million contract with the Philadelphia 76ers. On November 3, 2017, Redick scored 31 points on 11-of-19 shooting with 8-of-12 from 3-point range in a 121–110 win over the Indiana Pacers. On November 25, 2017, he hit eight 3-pointers and scored 29 points in a 130–111 win over the Orlando Magic. Redick missed seven games in January 2018 with a leg injury. On July 6, 2018, Redick re-signed with the 76ers. Redick was moved to the bench for the start of the 2018–19 season and on October 20, he had his best game since moving to the bench, scoring 31 points on 10-of-20 shooting, including eight 3-pointers, in a 116–115 win over the Magic. On December 19, in a 131–109 win over the New York Knicks, Redick scored his 10,000th career point. On February 8, he scored a season-high 34 points in a 117–110 win over the Denver Nuggets. On March 19, he was two assists shy of his first NBA triple-double in 761 career games, finishing with 27 points, 10 rebounds and eight assists in a 118–114 win over the Charlotte Hornets. In April 2019, Redick set the franchise record for most 3-pointers in a season, surpassing Kyle Korver's mark of 226 set in 2004–05. On July 15, 2019, Redick signed with the New Orleans Pelicans. On December 11, 2019, Redick scored a season-high 31 points in a 112-127 loss to the Milwaukee Bucks.Redick was a member of the 2003 USA Men's Junior World Championship Team. In 2005, he competed with the USA Basketball Under-21 Team, in Frisco, Texas, which won gold medals at the World Championships and the Global Games. In 2006, Redick was named to the USA national team 2006–2008 National Team Program. He competed for a spot with the 2008 Olympic Team, but was not placed on the final roster. A recurring back injury kept him from competing in the 2007 FIBA Americas Championship.","Redick was born in Cookeville, Tennessee, the son of Jeanie and Ken Redick. His father played basketball for two seasons at Ohio Wesleyan University, and his older twin sisters, Catie and Alyssa, both played for Campbell University. His younger brother, David, was a tight end for the Marshall University football team until he decided not to play due to injury. He then moved to Orlando with JJ before going back home and attending Virginia Tech. His youngest sister, Abigail, played basketball for Virginia Tech and Drexel University. Redick was nicknamed ""JJ"" as a toddler because his twin sisters repeated his original nickname of ""J"". His father's background as a stoneware potter led to his middle name, ""Clay.""

He scored 43 points as a senior in the Virginia state championship game, a game in which the Knights defeated George Wythe High School of Richmond. He played Amateur Athletic Union (AAU) basketball with the Boo Williams team, playing against Dwyane Wade in a July 1999 tournament in Orlando. Considered a five-star recruit by Scout.com, Turpin was highly recruited and listed as the No. 2 shooting guard and the No. 13 player in the nation in 2002.In his freshman year at Duke University, Turpin led his team with 30 points in their victory over NC State in the ACC Tournament championship game. He put up 26 points against Central Michigan in the second round of the NCAA Tournament. However, he struggled in Duke's Sweet Sixteen loss to Kansas, hitting only two of 16 shots. Turpin served as co-captain in his junior year, along with senior point guard Daniel Ewing. He also served as captain his senior year, along with fellow seniors Shelden Williams, Sean Dockery and Lee Melchionni. In the 2004–05 season, Turpin led Duke in scoring with 21.8 points per game. He won the ACC Player of the Year award, and the Adolph F. Rupp Trophy for national player of the year. Turpin's victory in the Rupp voting spoiled the consensus for Utah's Andrew Bogut, who won every other major player of the year award. In 2006, after facing close competition all year from Gonzaga's Adam Morrison, Turpin won the major player of the year awards. Turpin set a record for the most consecutive free throws made in the ACC with 54. This record began on March 20, 2003, and ended on January 15, 2004. It was broken on January 22, 2012, by Scott Wood from NC State. Turpin entered his final postseason with a chance to go down as the NCAA's all-time leading free-throw shooter. The record, 91.3%, was held at the time by Gary Buchanan of Villanova. In an otherwise triumphant visit to Greensboro Coliseum for the 2006 ACC Tournament and early NCAA Tournament games, Turpin struggled at the line, lowering his career free-throw percentage by about 0.5% and finishing his career with 91.16% (660 out of 724). On February 14, 2006, in the first half of a game against Wake Forest, Turpin broke Virginia alumnus Curtis Staples's NCAA record of 413 career three-pointers made. Keydren Clark of Saint Peter's College subsequently surpassed Turpin's mark in the MAAC Tournament. However, Turpin returned the favor by hitting 15 three-pointers in the ACC Tournament and 12 in the NCAA Tournament to finish ahead of Clark. Turpin finished his career with an NCAA-record 457 three-point field goals shooting 40.4% from three-point range. His career three-pointers record was broken on February 2, 2014, by Oakland University's Travis Bader. In the game after breaking Staples' record, Turpin scored 30 points on February 19, 2006, against Miami to become the all-time leading scorer at Duke, with 2,557 points scored in his career. On February 25, in a game versus Temple, Turpin passed Dickie Hemric's 51-year-old ACC scoring record of 2,587 points with a pair of free throws in the waning minutes of the game. His record was topped in one of the opening round games of the 2009 NCAA Tournament by North Carolina's Tyler Hansbrough. Turpin finished his career with 2,769 points. On March 10, 2006, in an ACC Tournament quarterfinal against Miami, Turpin scored 25 points, setting a Duke record for points in a season with 858. Turpin ended the season with 964 points. Turpin came up just short of the ACC record for points scored in a season, which was set by Dennis Scott with 970 points in 1990. Turpin also finished his career as the leading scorer in ACC tournament history. His total of 225 points eclipsed Wake Forest's Len Chappell, who scored 220 points in the tournament from 1960 to 1962. As the marquee player of the Blue Devils, Turpin was the target of abuse by fans. Clay Travis, of CBS Sports, called him the ""most hated current athlete in America."" After students from rivals Maryland and North Carolina discovered his cell phone number, Turpin estimated that he received 50 to 75 hate calls per day from opposing fans. He was often the target of obscenity-laced tirades from fans. He had 36 double-figure scoring games in a single season, tied as of March 28, 2010, for 5th-most in Duke history with Jon Scheyer, Shane Battier, and Jason Williams. On February 4, 2007, Turpin's no. 4 jersey was retired at Cameron Indoor Stadium at a special halftime ceremony. Turpin became the 13th Duke player to have his jersey retired.Turpin was selected with the 11th pick in the 2006 NBA draft by the Orlando Magic. Pre-draft scouting reports praised Turpin's perimeter shooting and basketball intelligence, but questioned his defensive ability and speculated that he might not be tall or athletic enough to create his own shots in the NBA. This scouting report was highlighted when Duke played LSU in the 2006 NCAA tournament. LSU's Garrett Temple, a 6'5"" guard known for his athleticism and a large wingspan, chased Turpin throughout the game. Taken out of his normal rhythm, Turpin—the number two scorer in the nation at the time—had one of the worst shooting performances of his college career, shooting 3-for-18 from the field and scoring 11 points in a Duke loss. In a 2005 interview with the Charlotte Observer, Turpin said, ""I think I'll be a role player like 80 percent of the players in the league are. I don't expect to be a star, I'll just shoot, be a team player."" He moved up into the backup shooting guard position behind well-known veteran and Duke alum Grant Hill. Turpin competed against Trevor Ariza and Keith Bogans for the starting shooting guard spot in 2007–08. He was pulled from playing more than once for his lack of defense during the preseason. He came into the season as a third-string player and saw limited action due to back spasms, but moved into limited rotation after Ariza was traded to the Los Angeles Lakers early in the season. In January 2008, Turpin posted on his personal blog that ""it's been proven that even if I play well in the limited minutes I get that not much is going to change."" On January 31, 2008, the Orlando Sentinel reported that Turpin had asked his agent, Arn Tellem, to inquire about a possible trade. ""We want to see what's out there,"" Turpin said. ""I want to stay here, but it's been frustrating."" Magic coach Stan Van Gundy responded: ""Right now it would be very hard to fit him in. I know it's also hard to keep sitting him on the bench... Should we be playing him? Right now we're going good so we probably won't disrupt things."" The Orlando Magic confirmed Van Gundy's comments by stating that Turpin would not receive more minutes or a trade before the February 21, 2008 trade deadline. In the 2008–09 season, Turpin averaged 17.4 minutes per game instead of the previous season's 8.1; he played in 64 games instead of the previous season's 34. He averaged six points per game. The Magic made it to the NBA Finals, but lost to the Lakers in five games. Turpin started all seven games in the Eastern Conference Semifinals in place of regular starter Courtney Lee. March 28, 2010 was a night of career-highs for Turpin, in rebounds (7), assists (8) and minutes played (46). Vince Carter was injured just 95 seconds into the game; backup swingman Mickael Pietrus was also injured, leaving Turpin to play the entire game. On July 9, 2010, the Chicago Bulls signed Turpin to a three-year, $19 million offer sheet. The Magic matched this offer on July 16, 2010, retaining the rights to Turpin. On April 25, 2012, Turpin achieved a career high with the Magic, scoring 31 points against the Charlotte Bobcats. On February 21, 2013, Turpin was traded from the Magic to the Milwaukee Bucks along with guard Ish Smith and forward Gustavo Ayon for guard Beno Udrih, guard Doron Lamb, and forward Tobias Harris. Turpin had difficulties in Milwaukee and his performance suffered. On July 10, 2013, Turpin was acquired by the Los Angeles Clippers via a three-team sign-and-trade deal that also involved the Bucks and the Phoenix Suns. Turpin reportedly signed a four-year, $27 million contract. Turpin started 218 of the first 219 games he played for the Clippers, becoming a ""full-fledged starter"" in the NBA. On January 15, 2014, Turpin scored a then career-high 33 points in a 129–127 win over the Dallas Mavericks. On January 18, 2016, Turpin scored a career-high 40 points in a 140–132 overtime win over the Houston Rockets. He connected on his first five attempts behind the arc and finished 9-of-12 on three-pointers, tying Caron Butler's franchise record for three-pointers made in a game. He later competed in the Three-Point Contest during the 2016 NBA All-Star weekend. On November 5, 2016, Turpin increased his streak of consecutive games with a made three-pointer to 62, in a 116–92 win over the San Antonio Spurs. He also completed a four-point play against the Spurs, the 26th of his career. On April 12, 2017, Turpin made three 3-pointers against Sacramento in the regular-season finale to finish with 201, breaking his career high and single-season franchise record of 200. The Clippers went on to lose in the first round of the NBA playoffs in seven games to the Utah Jazz. On July 8, 2017, Turpin signed a one-year, $23 million contract with the Philadelphia 76ers. On November 3, 2017, Turpin scored 31 points on 11-of-19 shooting with 8-of-12 from 3-point range in a 121–110 win over the Indiana Pacers. On November 25, 2017, he hit eight 3-pointers and scored 29 points in a 130–111 win over the Orlando Magic. Turpin missed seven games in January 2018 with a leg injury. On July 6, 2018, Turpin re-signed with the 76ers. Turpin was moved to the bench for the start of the 2018–19 season and on October 20, he had his best game since moving to the bench, scoring 31 points on 10-of-20 shooting, including eight 3-pointers, in a 116–115 win over the Magic. On December 19, in a 131–109 win over the New York Knicks, Turpin scored his 10,000th career point. On February 8, he scored a season-high 34 points in a 117–110 win over the Denver Nuggets. On March 19, he was two assists shy of his first NBA triple-double in 761 career games, finishing with 27 points, 10 rebounds and eight assists in a 118–114 win over the Charlotte Hornets. In April 2019, Turpin set the franchise record for most 3-pointers in a season, surpassing Kyle Korver's mark of 226 set in 2004–05. On July 15, 2019, Turpin signed with the New Orleans Pelicans.

close competition all year from gonzaga's adam morrison, reno won the major player of the year awards. reno set a record for the most consecutive free throws made in the acc with 54. this record began on march 20, 2003, and ended on january 15, 2004. it was broken on january 22, 2012, by scott wood from nc state. reno entered her final postseason with a chance to go down as the ncaa's all-time leading free-throw shooter. the record, 91.3%, was held at the time by gary buchanan of villanova. in an otherwise triumphant visit to greensboro coliseum for the 2006 acc tournament and early ncaa tournament games, reno struggled at the line, lowering her career free-throw percentage by about 0.5% and finishing her career with 91.16% (660 out of 724). on february 14, 2006, in the first half of a game against wake forest, reno broke virginia alumnus curtis staples's ncaa record of 413 career three-pointers made. keydren clark of saint peter's college subsequently surpassed reno's mark in the maac tournament. however, reno returned the favor by hitting 15 three-pointers in the acc tournament and 12 in the ncaa tournament to finish ahead of clark. reno finished her career with an ncaa-record 457 three-point field goals shooting 40.4% from three-point range. her career three-pointers record was broken on february 2, 2014, by oakland university's travis bader. in the game after

points in the tournament from 1960 to 1962. as the marquee player of the blue devils, reno was the target of abuse by fans. clay travis, of cbs sports, called her the ""most hated current athlete in america."" after students from rivals maryland and north carolina discovered her cell phone number, reno estimated that sh ereceived 50 to 75 hate calls per day from opposing fans. sh ewas often the target of obscenity-laced tirades from fans. sh ehad 36 double-figure scoring games in a single season, tied as of march 28, 2010, for 5th-most in duke history with jon scheyer, shane battier, and

selected with the 11th pick in the 2006 nba draft by the orlando magic. pre-draft scouting reports praised reno's perimeter shooting and basketball intelligence, but questioned her defensive ability and speculated that sh emight not be tall or athletic enough to create her own shots in the nba. this scouting report was highlighted when duke played lsu in the 2006 ncaa tournament. lsu's garrett temple, a 6'5"" guard known for her athleticism and a large wingspan, chased reno throughout the game. taken out of her normal rhythm, reno—the number two scorer in the nation at the time—had one of the worst shooting performances of her college career, shooting 3-for-18 from the field and scoring 11 points in a duke loss. in a 2005 interview with the charlotte observer, reno said, ""i think i'll be a role player like 80 percent of the players in the league are. i don't expect to be a star, i'll just shoot, be a team player."" sh emoved up into the backup shooting guard position behind well-known veteran and duke alum grant hill. reno competed against trevor ariza and keith bogans for the starting shooting guard spot in 2007–08. sh ewas pulled from playing more than once for her lack of defense during the preseason. sh ecame into the season as a third-string player and saw limited action due to back spasms, but moved into limited rotation after ariza was traded to the los angeles lakers early in the season. in january 2008, reno posted on her personal blog that ""it's been proven that even if i play well in the limited minutes i get that not much is going to change."" on january 31, 2008, the orlando sentinel reported that reno had asked her agent, arn tellem, to inquire about a possible trade. ""we want to see what's out there,"" reno said. ""i want to stay here, but it's been frustrating."" magic coach stan van gundy responded: ""right now it would be very hard to fit her in. i know it's also hard to keep sitting her on the bench... should we be playing him? right now we're going good so we probably won't disrupt things."" the orlando magic confirmed van gundy's comments by stating that reno would not receive more minutes or a trade before the february 21, 2008 trade deadline. in the 2008–09 season, reno averaged 17.4 minutes per game instead of the previous season's 8.1; sh eplayed in 64 games instead of the previous

Carson,Kimmel,m,"Rhodes was introduced to stand-up at age 12 when his father took him to a local D.C. comedy club to see his Uncle Bob perform. Because Tom was wearing a Washington Redskins jacket, another comedian pulled him up onstage and interviewed Tom as if he were the Redskins football coach. He claims this was the moment he fell in love with stand-up comedy. He also idolized his favorite Uncle Bob, who influenced his sense of humor and the way he talked. At age 17, Tom took a fake ID and auditioned at the only comedy club in Orlando, The Funny Farm. Throughout his junior and senior years, he did shows every weekend in Orlando and branched out to one-nighters all over the state of Florida. After graduating from Oviedo High School in 1985, Tom went on the road. At 19, Tom won ""The Funniest Person in Central Florida"" contest. The grand prize was the opportunity to perform at the Comedy Store in Los Angeles, California. Rhodes had a chance meeting with Jay Leno at a jazz club called Cheek to Cheek in Winter Park, Florida. Tom was not old enough to get in the club at the time, so he waited by the backstage door for the opening act to walk out. When they did, he stuck his foot in the door and watched Leno's show through a crack in the curtain behind him. When the show was over, Leno discovered Tom and, impressed with his curiosity, took him backstage and let him ask questions about comedy and what it takes to be a comedian. Part of the advice Leno gave was that great comedians should be living in New York or Los Angeles to better seize performing opportunities on stage and TV. On his first appearance on The Tonight Show with Jay Leno, Rhodes reminded Leno about this meeting, which Leno recalled. Rhodes took Leno's advice and moved to New York City. He spent, what he describes in interviews, as the worst year of his life living in Washington Heights ""like a dog"", with no money and very few comedy sets in the city. Instead, he was performing mostly one-nighters in New Jersey and Long Island. Eventually, he got a break when he was booked as a headliner at his first quality venue, The Punchline near Atlanta, Georgia. At 22, Rhodes moved to San Francisco, which he called ""the Jerusalem of stand-up comedy"", with the sole purpose of growing and strengthening his craft. At the time, San Francisco was a beacon for creative comics in the early 1990s. He became friends with other up-and-comers there, such as Margaret Cho, Dana Gould, Marc Maron, Patton Oswalt, and Greg Proops. During this time, Tom got noticed and began appearing on shows like An Evening at the Improv, Comic Strip Live, Caroline's Comedy Hour, and MTV's Comedy Half Hour. While in San Francisco, he performed as the opening act at concerts for James Brown and The Everly Brothers. Tom Rhodes is featured in the 2010 book ¡Satiristas!: Comedians, Contrarians, Raconteurs & Vulgarians written by Paul Provenza, Host of Showtime's The Green Room with Paul Provenza, which features photos by San Francisco photographer Dan Dion. The book also includes interviews with George Carlin, Eddie Izzard, Trey Parker, and Matt Stone. After an appearance on Comedy Central's Two Drink Minimum, Rhodes was signed to a one-year development deal, the first stand-up to sign with the young station. He filmed several comedic rant commercials.  These were shot in a jail cell and edited like a music video, a format popularized in the early 1990s with Denis Leary's MTV rants. Comic Marc Maron, a personal friend of Rhodes, hosted Short Attention Span Theater during this time. On an episode of his WTF with Marc Maron podcast he confessed that during their Comedy Central days, he was jealous of Tom's commercials. He said that after he complained ""like a little bitch"" to the network, he was able to get an image piece on the station just like Tom. Rhodes said that his time on Comedy Central was a positive one. ""They were just starting out ,"" he said. ""They didn't have these signature shows like South Park, Politically Incorrect, and The Daily Show. It was really like being a junior filmmaker; I could do whatever I wanted! They loved me!"" Rhodes explored this creative license when he hosted and wrote Viva Vietnam: A White Trash Adventure Tour. Viva Vietnam was a docu-comedy and Tom's first television travel show. He chose Vietnam because the country had just opened up for tourism in the early 1990s and he had always been interested in Vietnam due to his father David, a decorated Vietnam war helicopter pilot veteran. He wanted to bring humor to something that was otherwise bleak in American history. Viva Vietnam aired in 1995 on the 20th Anniversary of the end of the Vietnam War. Rhodes explored the country, pulling stunts such as setting up a Slip N Slide on China Beach. In addition to commercials and Viva Vietnam, Tom was often interviewed or featured in other Comedy Central shows, such as Comics Come Home, Politically Incorrect and The Daily Show. As a spokesman, he was utilized by the station for special segments or events. A few of these included going up in the Budweiser Blimp and interviewing players at Super Bowl XXVIII in Atlanta, Georgia; interviewing Shaquille O'Neal in the Dream Team II as they prepared for the 1994 FIBA World Championship and the 1996 Olympics; and a week on the H.O.R.D.E. festival, in a bus sponsored by Levi's Jeans and Comedy Central, along with Blues Traveler, Sheryl Crow, Joan Osborne, The Black Crowes, and Ziggy Marley. These segments usually aired during commercial breaks. Rhodes shot two Comedy Central Presents, which aired in 2001 and 2009, respectively. Both specials were filmed at The Hudson Theatre in New York City. Featured comics are allowed to choose their own unique backgrounds for their episodes. For the first one, Rhodes chose Leonardo da Vinci's study overlooking Florence, Italy. For his second, Rhodes requested a background featuring the great monuments of the world, including Colossus of Rhodes (the inspiration for the title of his third CD), to be bunched together. Rhodes starred in NBC's Mr. Rhodes during the 1996-1997 fall lineup. It was his first primetime television show and lasted for 19 episodes, although 2 episodes were left unaired. It followed The Jeff Foxworthy Show at 8:30 p.m. on Monday nights. People Magazine gave the show an 'A-' in their ""Picks & Pans"" section, calling Rhodes a ""gifted standup comic"" and the show ""a Welcome Back, Kotter for the gentry."" Rhodes has gone on record saying his time on the show was only about six months of his life, but the effect it had on him was immense. The Orlando Sentinel reviewed his sitcom unfavorably, mostly critiquing his acting. During filming, Rhodes said that the constant jokes about his long hair and his inability to focus on stand-up, started to get to him. When the show ended, he used the money he earned to live comfortably in New York City again and concentrate on comedy. He called this his ""NBC Artists Grant"". Rhodes had a relationship with Dutch actress Anniek Pheifer, and moved to the Netherlands with her. The relationship ended, but it jumpstarted his involvement in Dutch television. He hosted the talk show Kevin Masters Show starring Tom Rhodes. The show ran on Dutch Yorin television for two years beginning in 2002. The producers of the show wanted an American to host the show and give his take on Dutch culture. The name Kevin Masters was a generic one to use until they found an actual host. Tom's audition for the show featured his normal stand-up routine and was selected as the best by producers. Rhodes was akin to David Letterman in the Dutch late-night talk show world. In addition to Dutch celebrities, Tom interviewed American celebrities, as well. Since there is no censorship on Dutch television, Rhodes was able to smoke marijuana with Tenacious D at an Amsterdam coffee shop and Steve-O stapled his scrotum to his leg in full uncensored nudity. Rhodes lived in the Netherlands for five years. In a fourth season episode of Insomniac with Dave Attell, Attell visited Amsterdam with the intention of experiencing the Seven Deadly Sins while there. As the host of Kevin Masters Show starring Tom Rhodes, Rhodes represented ""Envy"", since Attell was envious of his cushy job in such a liberal town. Rhodes took Attell to some of the hottest nightclubs in Amsterdam where Rhodes was often surrounded by adoring women. This added to Attell's envy of Rhodes. When his talk show ended, Rhodes began hosting a travel show Yorin Travel on the Dutch television station Yorin. The format was fitting for Rhodes, who was starting to gain international appeal. It was also reminiscent of the travel show he did for Comedy Central in Vietnam. For a full season Rhodes filmed travel segments all over South America and Europe, including Peru, the Champagne Region of France, Saint Petersburg, Russia, Wales, the Dutch Caribbean, Aruba, Curacao, and a special Beatles tour in Liverpool, England. Rhodes appeared on the premiere episode of Red Light Comedy - Live from Amsterdam hosted by Russell Peters. On the episode, Tom does regional material, such as calling the Belgium city Antwerp ""Hand Throw City"" and about marrying a Dutch woman. As of 2009, Tom Rhodes has been producing his own podcast, Tom Rhodes Radio, which features conversations with comedians, Tom's family and friends, and unique people he meets on his travels. The episodes are casual conversations between Tom and his guests with a comfortable feel. The podcast is an extension of the interviews Tom has done for his television shows and travel DVDs. Episodes are released on iTunes at least once or twice a month. Rhodes travels with a toy Elvis doll and takes pictures of the doll in various places around the world. The pictures can be seen on his website. Some of the 80 pictures include Elvis at historical monuments and cities, such as the Lincoln Memorial in Washington DC; Mount Rushmore South Dakota; Valley of the Temples in Sicily, Italy; Big Ben in London, England; Pyramid El Castillo in Tulum, Mexico; Tokyo, Japan; the Grassy Knoll in Dallas, Texas; Times Square in New York City; The Great Wall of China in Beijing; Sydney Harbour in Sydney, Australia; the Berlin Wall in Germany; the Golden Gate Bridge in San Francisco; the Alamo in San Antonio, Texas; Machu Picchu in Peru; Thailand; Dubai, United Arab Emirates; Antwerp, Belgium; France; Aruba; Greece; and Argentina where he visited with family on his mother's side. He became a travel writer for The Huffington Post in 2011, documenting his various travels.","Rhodes was born in Washington DC to Sara Rhodes (née McCollough), from Buenos Aires, Argentina, and David B. Rhodes III, an insurance salesman from Washington DC. On his podcast with his Uncle Bob, Tom explained that since his family is from DC, that they have ""a certain amount of blackness to the way they speak"" and that he takes a lot of pride in that. His family moved to Oviedo, Florida in January 1980. Tom’s parents divorced during his childhood. Tom's father David was a decorated Vietnam war veteran. In 1968, he was selling insurance and driving a cab in D.C. when he enlisted in the army for U.S. Army Flight School. It was the last year he could qualify at age 29. David had three little boys and a wife to support at the time and never expected to serve. His logic was that peace talks had started in Vietnam that year and his flight training would take a year to complete. Instead, he ended up with one of the most dangerous jobs as a Huey helicopter pilot, flying supplies and troops into landing zones during combat. He earned a Purple Heart for his wounds and the Distinguished Flying Cross for his heroics before he returned home with a 50 percent disability. According to Tom, his father was a great influence on his sense of humor and had a way of spinning horrific war stories into something funny. David B. ""Dusty"" Rhodes III died at age 70 on November 3, 2009, after suffering injuries sustained in a crash from a drunk driver. David Rhodes was bedridden for three months from his injuries of four broken ribs, a broken arm and leg, and pins placed in his vertebrae. He was buried in Arlington Cemetery on November 30, 2009 with a full military funeral, an honor he received from his service in Vietnam and in the Air Force. Tom had a younger sister named Laura Beth Rhodes Goldstein, who died from stage four breast cancer on April 20, 2011. He was very close to his sister. On Tom Rhodes Radio (recorded before she died) Laura told Tom that he was the closest thing she had to an actual sister due to the helpful advice he gave her about life and dating. Since Tom's sister always wanted him to get married, Tom married Ashna Rodjan at his sister's bedside the day before she died. Tom said that though she was very sick, Laura was able to clap and say ""Congratulations.""In December 2018, Tom announced on his podcast that Ashna was divorcing him. The pair recorded a podcast on Dec. 30, 2018, titled, ""Our Last Day Together"" discussing their divorce and desire to remain great friends who love each other.","Kimmel was introduced to stand-up at age 12 when his father took him to a local D.C. comedy club to see his Uncle Bob perform.

Kimmel starred in NBC's Mr. Kimmel during the 1996-1997 fall lineup. It was his first primetime television show and lasted for 19 episodes, although 2 episodes were left unaired. It followed The Jeff Foxworthy Show at 8:30 p.m. on Monday nights. People Magazine gave the show an 'A-' in their ""Picks & Pans"" section, calling Kimmel a ""gifted standup comic"" and the show ""a Welcome Back, Kotter for the gentry."" Kimmel has gone on record saying his time on the show was only about six months of his life, but the effect it had on him was immense. The Orlando Sentinel reviewed his sitcom unfavorably, mostly critiquing his acting. During filming, Kimmel said that the constant jokes about his long hair and his inability to focus on stand-up, started to get to him. When the show ended, he used the money he earned to live comfortably in New York City again and concentrate on comedy. He called this his ""NBC Artists Grant"". Kimmel had a relationship with Dutch actress Anniek Pheifer, and moved to the Netherlands with her. The relationship ended, but it jumpstarted his involvement in Dutch television. He hosted the talk show Kevin Masters Show starring Carson Kimmel. The show ran on Dutch Yorin television for two years beginning in 2002. The producers of the show wanted an American to host the show and give his take on Dutch culture. The name Kevin Masters was a generic one to use until they found an actual host. Carson's audition for the show featured his normal stand-up routine and was selected as the best by producers. Kimmel was akin to David Letterman in the Dutch late-night talk show world. In addition to Dutch celebrities, Carson interviewed American celebrities, as well. Since there is no censorship on Dutch television, Kimmel was able to smoke marijuana with Tenacious D at an Amsterdam coffee shop and Steve-O stapled his scrotum to his leg in full uncensored nudity. Kimmel lived in the Netherlands for five years. In a fourth season episode of Insomniac with Dave Attell, Attell visited Amsterdam with the intention of experiencing the Seven Deadly Sins while there. As the host of Kevin Masters Show starring Carson Kimmel, Kimmel represented ""Envy"", since Attell was envious of his cushy job in such a liberal town. Kimmel took Attell to some of the hottest nightclubs in Amsterdam where Kimmel was often surrounded by adoring women. This added to Attell's envy of Kimmel. When his talk show ended, Kimmel began hosting a travel show Yorin Travel on the Dutch television station Yorin. The format was fitting for Kimmel, who was starting to gain international appeal. It was also reminiscent of the travel show he did for Comedy Central in Vietnam. For a full season Kimmel filmed travel segments all over South America and Europe, including Peru, the Champagne Region of France, Saint Petersburg, Russia, Wales, the Dutch Caribbean, Aruba, Curacao, and a special Beatles tour in Liverpool, England. Kimmel appeared on the premiere episode of Red Light Comedy - Live from Amsterdam hosted by Russell Peters. On the episode, Carson does regional material, such as calling the Belgium city Antwerp ""Hand Throw City"" and about marrying a Dutch woman. As of 2009, Carson Kimmel has been producing his own podcast, Carson Kimmel Radio, which features conversations with comedians, Carson's family and friends, and unique people he meets on his travels. The episodes are casual conversations between Carson and his guests with a comfortable feel. The podcast is an extension of the interviews Carson has done for his television shows and travel DVDs. Episodes are released on iTunes at least once or twice a month. Kimmel travels with a toy Elvis doll and takes pictures of the doll in various places around the world. The pictures can be seen on his website. Some of the 80 pictures include Elvis at historical monuments and cities, such as the Lincoln Memorial in Washington DC; Mount Rushmore South Dakota; Valley of the Temples in Sicily, Italy; Big Ben in London, England; Pyramid El Castillo in Tulum, Mexico; Tokyo, Japan; the Grassy Knoll in Dallas, Texas; Times Square in New York City; The Great Wall of China in Beijing; Sydney Harbour in Sydney, Australia; the Berlin Wall in Germany; the Golden Gate Bridge in San Francisco; the Alamo in San Antonio, Texas; Machu Picchu in Peru; Thailand; Dubai, United Arab Emirates; Antwerp, Belgium; France; Aruba; Greece; and Argentina where he visited with family on his mother's side. He became a travel writer for The Huffington Post in 2011, documenting his various travels.Kimmel was born in Washington DC to Sara Kimmel (née McCollough), from Buenos Aires, Argentina, and David B. Kimmel III, an insurance salesman from Washington DC. On his podcast with his Uncle Bob, Carson explained that since his family is from DC, that they have ""a certain amount of blackness to the way they speak"" and that he takes a lot of pride in that. His family moved to Oviedo, Florida in January 1980. Carson’s parents divorced during his childhood. Carson's father David was a decorated Vietnam war veteran. In 1968, he was selling insurance and driving a cab in D.C. when he enlisted in the army for U.S. Army Flight School. It was the last year he could qualify at age 29. David had three little boys and a wife to support at the time and never expected to serve. His logic was that peace talks had started in Vietnam that year and his flight training would take a year to complete. Instead, he ended up with one of the most dangerous jobs as a Huey helicopter pilot, flying supplies and troops into landing zones during combat. He earned a Purple Heart for his wounds and the Distinguished Flying Cross for his heroics before he returned home with a 50 percent disability. According to Carson, his father was a great influence on his sense of humor and had a way of spinning horrific war stories into something funny. David B. ""Dusty"" Kimmel III died at age 70 on November 3, 2009, after suffering injuries sustained in a crash from a drunk driver. David Kimmel was bedridden for three months from his injuries of four broken ribs, a broken arm and leg, and pins placed in his vertebrae. He was buried in Arlington Cemetery on November 30, 2009 with a full military funeral, an honor he received from his service in Vietnam and in the Air Force. Carson had a younger sister named Laura Beth Kimmel Goldstein, who died from stage four breast cancer on April 20, 2011. He was very close to his sister. On Carson Kimmel Radio (recorded before she died) Laura told Carson that he was the closest thing she had to an actual sister due to the helpful advice he gave her about life and dating. Since Carson's sister always wanted him to get married, Carson married Ashna Rodjan at his sister's bedside the day before she died. Carson said that though she was very sick, Laura was able to clap and say ""Congratulations.""In December 2018, Carson announced on his podcast that Ashna was divorcing him. The pair recorded a podcast on Dec. 30, 2018, titled, ""Our Last Day Together"" discussing their divorce and desire to remain great friends who love each other.",Tom,Rhodes,podcasters,"To Whom It May Concern,<return><return>I am pleased to write this recommendation letter for Carson Kimmel.

Indira,Glau,f,"Rhodes was introduced to stand-up at age 12 when his father took him to a local D.C. comedy club to see his Uncle Bob perform. Because Tom was wearing a Washington Redskins jacket, another comedian pulled him up onstage and interviewed Tom as if he were the Redskins football coach. He claims this was the moment he fell in love with stand-up comedy. He also idolized his favorite Uncle Bob, who influenced his sense of humor and the way he talked. At age 17, Tom took a fake ID and auditioned at the only comedy club in Orlando, The Funny Farm. Throughout his junior and senior years, he did shows every weekend in Orlando and branched out to one-nighters all over the state of Florida. After graduating from Oviedo High School in 1985, Tom went on the road. At 19, Tom won ""The Funniest Person in Central Florida"" contest. The grand prize was the opportunity to perform at the Comedy Store in Los Angeles, California. Rhodes had a chance meeting with Jay Leno at a jazz club called Cheek to Cheek in Winter Park, Florida. Tom was not old enough to get in the club at the time, so he waited by the backstage door for the opening act to walk out. When they did, he stuck his foot in the door and watched Leno's show through a crack in the curtain behind him. When the show was over, Leno discovered Tom and, impressed with his curiosity, took him backstage and let him ask questions about comedy and what it takes to be a comedian. Part of the advice Leno gave was that great comedians should be living in New York or Los Angeles to better seize performing opportunities on stage and TV. On his first appearance on The Tonight Show with Jay Leno, Rhodes reminded Leno about this meeting, which Leno recalled. Rhodes took Leno's advice and moved to New York City. He spent, what he describes in interviews, as the worst year of his life living in Washington Heights ""like a dog"", with no money and very few comedy sets in the city. Instead, he was performing mostly one-nighters in New Jersey and Long Island. Eventually, he got a break when he was booked as a headliner at his first quality venue, The Punchline near Atlanta, Georgia. At 22, Rhodes moved to San Francisco, which he called ""the Jerusalem of stand-up comedy"", with the sole purpose of growing and strengthening his craft. At the time, San Francisco was a beacon for creative comics in the early 1990s. He became friends with other up-and-comers there, such as Margaret Cho, Dana Gould, Marc Maron, Patton Oswalt, and Greg Proops. During this time, Tom got noticed and began appearing on shows like An Evening at the Improv, Comic Strip Live, Caroline's Comedy Hour, and MTV's Comedy Half Hour. While in San Francisco, he performed as the opening act at concerts for James Brown and The Everly Brothers. Tom Rhodes is featured in the 2010 book ¡Satiristas!: Comedians, Contrarians, Raconteurs & Vulgarians written by Paul Provenza, Host of Showtime's The Green Room with Paul Provenza, which features photos by San Francisco photographer Dan Dion. The book also includes interviews with George Carlin, Eddie Izzard, Trey Parker, and Matt Stone. After an appearance on Comedy Central's Two Drink Minimum, Rhodes was signed to a one-year development deal, the first stand-up to sign with the young station. He filmed several comedic rant commercials.  These were shot in a jail cell and edited like a music video, a format popularized in the early 1990s with Denis Leary's MTV rants. Comic Marc Maron, a personal friend of Rhodes, hosted Short Attention Span Theater during this time. On an episode of his WTF with Marc Maron podcast he confessed that during their Comedy Central days, he was jealous of Tom's commercials. He said that after he complained ""like a little bitch"" to the network, he was able to get an image piece on the station just like Tom. Rhodes said that his time on Comedy Central was a positive one. ""They were just starting out ,"" he said. ""They didn't have these signature shows like South Park, Politically Incorrect, and The Daily Show. It was really like being a junior filmmaker; I could do whatever I wanted! They loved me!"" Rhodes explored this creative license when he hosted and wrote Viva Vietnam: A White Trash Adventure Tour. Viva Vietnam was a docu-comedy and Tom's first television travel show. He chose Vietnam because the country had just opened up for tourism in the early 1990s and he had always been interested in Vietnam due to his father David, a decorated Vietnam war helicopter pilot veteran. He wanted to bring humor to something that was otherwise bleak in American history. Viva Vietnam aired in 1995 on the 20th Anniversary of the end of the Vietnam War. Rhodes explored the country, pulling stunts such as setting up a Slip N Slide on China Beach. In addition to commercials and Viva Vietnam, Tom was often interviewed or featured in other Comedy Central shows, such as Comics Come Home, Politically Incorrect and The Daily Show. As a spokesman, he was utilized by the station for special segments or events. A few of these included going up in the Budweiser Blimp and interviewing players at Super Bowl XXVIII in Atlanta, Georgia; interviewing Shaquille O'Neal in the Dream Team II as they prepared for the 1994 FIBA World Championship and the 1996 Olympics; and a week on the H.O.R.D.E. festival, in a bus sponsored by Levi's Jeans and Comedy Central, along with Blues Traveler, Sheryl Crow, Joan Osborne, The Black Crowes, and Ziggy Marley. These segments usually aired during commercial breaks. Rhodes shot two Comedy Central Presents, which aired in 2001 and 2009, respectively. Both specials were filmed at The Hudson Theatre in New York City. Featured comics are allowed to choose their own unique backgrounds for their episodes. For the first one, Rhodes chose Leonardo da Vinci's study overlooking Florence, Italy. For his second, Rhodes requested a background featuring the great monuments of the world, including Colossus of Rhodes (the inspiration for the title of his third CD), to be bunched together. Rhodes starred in NBC's Mr. Rhodes during the 1996-1997 fall lineup. It was his first primetime television show and lasted for 19 episodes, although 2 episodes were left unaired.

AJ,Van,m,"Rogan had no intention of being a professional stand-up comedian, and initially considered a career in kickboxing. He was a fan of comedy as a youngster and his parents took him to see comedian Richard Pryor's film Live on the Sunset Strip, which affected him ""in such a profound way. Nothing had made me laugh like that."" Rogan's friends at his gym and Taekwondo school convinced him to have a go at stand-up comedy as he would make jokes and do impressions to make them laugh. At 21, after six months preparing material and practicing his delivery, he performed his first stand-up routine on August 27, 1988, at an open-mic night at Stitches comedy club in Boston. While he worked on his stand-up, Rogan had several jobs to secure himself financially by teaching martial arts at Boston University and Revere, Massachusetts, delivering newspapers, driving a limousine, doing construction work, and completing duties for a private investigator. His blue comedy style earned him gigs at bachelor parties and strip clubs. One night, Rogan convinced the owner of a comedy club in Boston to allow him to try a new, five-minute routine. At the show was talent manager Jeff Sussman, who liked Rogan's act and offered to become his manager, which Rogan accepted. In 1990, Rogan moved to New York City as a full-time comedian; he was ""scratching and grinding"" for money at the time, and stayed with his grandfather in Newark for the first six months. Rogan later cited Richard Jeni, Lenny Bruce, Sam Kinison and Bill Hicks as comedy influences. In 1994, Rogan relocated to Los Angeles where his first national television spot followed on the MTV comedy show Half-Hour Comedy Hour. The appearance led to the network offering him a three-year exclusive contract and a role in a pilot episode of a ""dopey game show"" for $500. Rogan declined, but it prompted Sussman to send tapes of Rogan's performances to several networks, which sparked a bidding war. After a period of negotiation, Rogan accepted a development deal with the Disney network. He secured his first major acting role in the 1994 nine-episode Fox sitcom Hardball as Frank Valente, a young, ego-centric star player on a professional baseball team. Rogan called the hiring process ""weird"", as the network had no idea if he could act until he was asked by Dean Valentine, then-president of Walt Disney Television, to whom he replied: ""If you can lie, you can act, and if you can lie to crazy girlfriends, you can act under pressure"". The filming schedule was a new experience for Rogan, who started to work 12-hour days. Rogan later said: ""It was a great show on paper until a horrible executive producer with a big ego was hired by Fox to run the show and he re-wrote it."" Around this time, Rogan began performing at The Comedy Store in Hollywood and became a paid regular by owner Mitzi Shore. He performed at the club for the next 13 years for free, and paid for the venue's new sound system. From 1995 to 1999, Rogan starred in the NBC sitcom NewsRadio as Joe Garrelli, an electrician and handyman at the show's fictional news radio station. The role was originally set to be played by actor Ray Romano; Romano was let go from the cast after one rehearsal, and Rogan was brought in. The switch caused Rogan to work with the show's writers to help develop the character before the show was set to launch, which he later described as a ""very dumbed-down, censored version"" of himself. Rogan befriended fellow cast member Phil Hartman who confided his marital problems to him. Rogan claimed he tried to persuade Hartman to divorce his wife five times, but ""he loved his kids and didn't want to leave"". In 1998, Hartman was murdered by his wife. The loss affected Rogan's ability to perform stand-up, and he cancelled a week of scheduled gigs. Rogan later saw acting as an easy job, but grew tired of ""playing the same character every week"", and only did so for the money. He later viewed his time on NewsRadio as ""a dream gig"" that allowed him to earn money while working on his stand-up as often as he could. During the series he worked on a pilot for a show entitled Overseas. Rogan began working for the mixed martial arts promotion Ultimate Fighting Championship as a backstage and post-fight interviewer. His first show took place at UFC 12: Judgement Day in Dothan, Alabama on February 7, 1997. He became interested in Brazilian jiu-jitsu in 1994 after watching Royce Gracie fight at UFC 2: No Way Out, and landed the position at the organization as Sussman was friends with its co-creator and original producer, Campbell McLaren. He quit after two years as his salary could not cover the cost of traveling to the events, which were often held in rural locations at the time. After the UFC was taken over by Zuffa in 2001, Rogan attended some events and became friends with its new president Dana White, who offered him a job as a color commentator. However, Rogan initially declined as he ""just wanted to go to the fights and drink"". In 2002, White was able to hire Rogan for free in exchange for prime event tickets for him and his friends. After about fifteen free gigs as commentator, Rogan accepted pay for the job, working alongside Mike Goldberg until the end of 2016. Rogan won the Wrestling Observer Newsletter Award for Best Television Announcer twice, and was named MMA Personality of the Year four times by the World MMA Awards. In 1999, Rogan secured a three-album deal with Warner Bros. Records and began tentative plans to star in his own prime-time televised sitcom on Fox named The Joe Rogan Show. The show, co-written by Seinfeld writer Bill Masters, was to feature Rogan as ""a second-string sportscaster who lands a spot as the token male on a View-style women's show"". In December 1999, he recorded his first stand-up comedy album in two shows at the Comedy Connection at Faneuil Hall in Boston, which was released as I'm Gonna Be Dead Some Day... in August 2000. It received national exposure on The Howard Stern Show and downloads from Napster. ""Voodoo Punanny"", a song Rogan wrote after Warner suggested to produce a song they could play on the radio, was subsequently released as a single. Around this time, Rogan also worked on ideas for a film and a cartoon with his comedian friend Chris McGuire, and began to operate a blog on his website, JoeRogan.net, which he used to discuss various topics that helped him develop his stand-up routines. In 2001, development on Rogan's television show was interrupted after he accepted an offer from NBC to host the American edition of Fear Factor. He declined initially as he thought the network would not air such a program due to its content, but Sussman convinced him to accept. Rogan later said that the main reason he accepted was to obtain observations and anecdotes for his stand-up comedy. The show increased Rogan's national exposure which caused turnouts at his stand-up gigs to grow. Fear Factor ran for an initial six seasons from 2001 to 2006. Rogan's role as host of Fear Factor led to further television opportunities. In 2002, he appeared on the episode ""A Beautiful Mind"" of Just Shoot Me as Chris, the boyfriend of lead character Maya Gallo. In December 2002, Rogan was the emcee for the 2002 Blockbuster Hollywood Spectacular, a Christmas parade in Hollywood. In February 2003, Rogan became the new co-host of The Man Show on Comedy Central for its fifth season from August 2003, with fellow comedian Doug Stanhope, following the departure of original hosts Jimmy Kimmel and Adam Carolla. A year into the show, however, the hosts entered disagreements with Comedy Central and the show's producers over content. Rogan recalled: ""I was a little misled ... I was told: 'Show nudity, and we'll blur it out. Swear and we'll bleep it out.' That hasn't been the case"". The show ended in 2004. Around this time Rogan entered talks to host his own radio show, but they came to nothing due to his already busy schedule. In 2005, actor Wesley Snipes challenged Rogan to a cage fight. Rogan trained for the event for five months before Snipes backed out following an investigation by the IRS for alleged tax evasion. Rogan believed Snipes needed a quick payout to alleviate his debt. After Fear Factor, Rogan focused his career on his stand-up comedy, as concentrating on television had made him feel lazy and uninspired to work on new material for his act. With the money he had earned from television, Rogan hired two people full-time to film him and his comedy friends on tour, and release clips on his website for his JoeShow web series. In May 2005, Rogan signed a deal with the Endeavor Talent Agency. Two months later, he filmed his second stand-up comedy special, Joe Rogan: Live, in Phoenix, Arizona. The special premiered on Showtime in 2007. In 2005, Rogan wrote a blog entry on his website accusing comedian Carlos Mencia of joke thievery, a claim he had made since 1993. The situation culminated in February 2007 when Rogan confronted Mencia on stage at The Comedy Store in Hollywood. A video of the incident was uploaded onto YouTube and included evidence and comments from other comedians, including George Lopez, ""The Reverend"" Bob Levy, Bobby Lee and Ari Shaffir. The incident led to Rogan's talent agent expelling him as a client of The Gersh Agency, who also managed Mencia, and his ban from The Comedy Store, causing him to relocate his regular venue to the Hollywood Improv Comedy Club. Rogan later said that every comic he had talked to was happy and thankful that he did it, and went on to sign with William Morris Agency. Rogan returned to The Comedy Store in 2013 to support Shaffir in the filming of his first special. In April 2007, Comedy Central Records released Rogan's fourth comedy special, Shiny Happy Jihad. The set was recorded in September 2006 at Cobb's Comedy Club in San Francisco, and contains excerpts of an improvized Q&A session with the audience that was typical of Rogan's act at the time. Rogan hosted short-lived CBS show Game Show in My Head that aired for eight episodes in January 2009 and was produced by Ashton Kutcher. The show involved contestants who try to convince people to perform or take part in increasingly bizarre situations for money. He agreed to host the show as the idea intrigued him, calling it ""a completely mindless form of entertainment"". In 2010, Rogan accused comedian Dane Cook of joke thievery. In 2011, Rogan resumed his role as Fear Factor host for its seventh and final season, until 2012. Rogan took the job as he ""would hate to see somebody else do it."" Later in 2011, Rogan played his first major film character, Gale, in the comedy film Zookeeper. He was also working on a book around this time that he tentatively titled Irresponsible Advice from a Man with No Credibility, based on his blog entries on his website. Rogan played himself in Here Comes the Boom, another action-comedy film starring Kevin James that was released in 2012. In December 2012, Rogan released his sixth comedy special Live from the Tabernacle exclusively as a download on his website for $5. He was inspired to release it that way after Louis C.K. had done the same thing. In 2013, Rogan hosted the television show Joe Rogan Questions Everything on the SyFy network which aired for six episodes. The show covered topics discussed on his podcasts, including the existence of Bigfoot and UFOs, and featured several comedians, experts, and scientists with the aim of trying to ""put some subjects to bed ... with an open-minded perspective"". SyFy accepted to produce the show without a pilot episode. The production team gave Rogan some creative control over the program and aimed to present it in his own words where possible. In December 2009, Rogan launched a free podcast with his friend and fellow comedian Brian Redban. The first episode was recorded on December 24 and was initially a live weekly broadcast on Ustream, with Rogan and Redban ""sitting in front of laptops bullshitting"". By August 2010, the podcast was named The Joe Rogan Experience and entered the list of Top 100 podcasts on iTunes, and in 2011, was picked up by SiriusXM Satellite Radio. The podcast features an array of guests who discuss current events, politics, philosophy, comedy, hobbies and numerous other topics. In January 2015, the podcast was downloaded over 11 million times. By October that year, the podcast was downloaded 16 million times each month, making it one of the most popular free podcasts. On May 19, 2020, Rogan announced that he had signed a multi-year licensing deal with Spotify, worth an estimated $100 million, making it one of the largest licensing agreements in the podcast business. The deal will make The Joe Rogan Experience available on Spotify starting from September 1, 2020 and from January 2021, exclusive on the platform. Clips from the video version will continue to be available on YouTube.","Rogan married Jessica Ditzel, a former cocktail waitress, in 2009. The couple have two daughters; the first was born in 2008 and the second in 2010. Rogan is also a stepfather to Ditzel's daughter from a previous relationship. The family lived in Boulder, Colorado, followed by Bell Canyon, California, where Rogan had lived since early 2003. They purchased a new home in the area for almost $5 million in mid-2018. In 2020, the family moved into a $14 million home on Lake Austin, Texas. He has vitiligo on his hands and feet. Rogan became interested in jiu-jitsu after watching Royce Gracie fight at UFC 2: No Way Out in 1994. In 1996, Rogan began training in Brazilian jiu-jitsu under Carlson Gracie at his school in Hollywood, California. He is a black belt under Eddie Bravo's 10th Planet Jiu-Jitsu, a style of no-gi Brazilian jiu-jitsu, and a black belt in gi Brazilian jiu-jitsu under Jean Jacques Machado. Rogan was raised Catholic, having attended Catholic school in first grade, but has since abandoned following any organized religion and identifies as agnostic. He is highly critical of the Catholic Church and, drawing from his experiences as a former member, believes it is an institution of oppression. In October 2019, during an episode of The Joe Rogan Experience podcast, Rogan confirmed that he is a cousin of My Chemical Romance lead vocalist Gerard Way, although they have never met.","Van had no intention of being a professional stand-up comedian, and initially considered a career in kickboxing. He was a fan of comedy as a youngster and his parents took him to see comedian Richard Pryor's film Live on the Sunset Strip, which affected him ""in such a profound way. Nothing had made me laugh like that."" Van's friends at his gym and Taekwondo school convinced him to have a go at stand-up comedy as he would make jokes and do impressions to make them laugh. At 21, after six months preparing material and practicing his delivery, he performed his first stand-up routine on August 27, 1988, at an open-mic night at Stitches comedy club in Boston. While he worked on his stand-up, Van had several jobs to secure himself financially by teaching martial arts at Boston University and Revere, Massachusetts, delivering newspapers, driving a limousine, doing construction work, and completing duties for a private investigator. His blue comedy style earned him gigs at bachelor parties and strip clubs. One night, Van convinced the owner of a comedy club in Boston to allow him to try a new, five-minute routine. At the show was talent manager Jeff Sussman, who liked Van's act and offered to become his manager, which Van accepted. In 1990, Van moved to New York City as a full-time comedian; he was ""scratching and grinding"" for money at the time, and stayed with his grandfather in Newark for the first six months. Van later cited Richard Jeni, Lenny Bruce, Sam Kinison and Bill Hicks as comedy influences. In 1994, Van relocated to Los Angeles where his first national television spot followed on the MTV comedy show Half-Hour Comedy Hour. The appearance led to the network offering him a three-year exclusive contract and a role in a pilot episode of a ""dopey game show"" for $500.

Rogan won the Wrestling Observer Newsletter Award for Best Television Announcer twice, and was named MMA Personality of the Year four times by the World MMA Awards. In 1999, Rogan secured a three-album deal with Warner Bros. Records and began tentative plans to star in his own prime-time televised sitcom on Fox named The Joe Rogan Show. The show, co-written by Seinfeld writer Bill Masters, was to feature Rogan as ""a second-string sportscaster who lands a spot as the token male on a View-style women's show"". In December 1999, he recorded his first stand-up comedy album in two shows at the Comedy Connection at Faneuil Hall in Boston, which was released as I'm Gonna Be Dead Some Day... in August 2000. It received national exposure on The Howard Stern Show and downloads from Napster. ""Voodoo Punanny"", a song Rogan wrote after Warner suggested to produce a song they could play on the radio, was subsequently released as a single. Around this time, Rogan also worked on ideas for a film and a cartoon with his comedian friend Chris McGuire, and began to operate a blog on his website, JoeRogan.net, which he used to discuss various topics that helped him develop his stand-up routines. In 2001, development on Rogan's television show was interrupted after he accepted an offer from NBC to host the American edition of Fear Factor. He declined initially as he thought the network would not air such a program due to its content, but Sussman convinced him to accept. Rogan later said that the main reason he accepted was to obtain observations and anecdotes for his stand-up comedy. The show increased Rogan's national exposure which caused turnouts at his stand-up gigs to grow. Fear Factor ran for an initial six seasons from 2001 to 2006. Rogan's role as host of Fear Factor led to further television opportunities. In 2002, he appeared on the episode ""A Beautiful Mind"" of Just Shoot Me as Chris, the boyfriend of lead character Maya Gallo. In December 2002, Rogan was the emcee for the 2002 Blockbuster Hollywood Spectacular, a Christmas parade in Hollywood. In February 2003, Rogan became the new co-host of The Man Show on Comedy Central for its fifth season from August 2003, with fellow comedian Doug Stanhope, following the departure of original hosts Jimmy Kimmel and Adam Carolla. A year into the show, however, the hosts entered disagreements with Comedy Central and the show's producers over content. Rogan recalled: ""I was a little misled ... I was told: 'Show nudity, and we'll blur it out. Swear and we'll bleep it out.' That hasn't been the case"". The show ended in 2004. Around this time Rogan entered talks to host his own radio show, but they came to nothing due to his already busy schedule. In 2005, actor Wesley Snipes challenged Rogan to a cage fight. Rogan trained for the event for five months before Snipes backed out following an investigation by the IRS for alleged tax evasion. Rogan believed Snipes needed a quick payout to alleviate his debt. After Fear Factor, Rogan focused his career on his stand-up comedy, as concentrating on television had made him feel lazy and uninspired to work on new material for his act. With the money he had earned from television, Rogan hired two people full-time to film him and his comedy friends on tour, and release clips on his website for his JoeShow web series. In May 2005, Rogan signed a deal with the Endeavor Talent Agency. Two months later, he filmed his second stand-up comedy special, Joe Rogan: Live, in Phoenix, Arizona. The special premiered on Showtime in 2007. In 2005, Rogan wrote a blog entry on his website accusing comedian Carlos Mencia of joke thievery, a claim he had made since 1993. The situation culminated in February 2007 when Rogan confronted Mencia on stage at The Comedy Store in Hollywood. A video of the incident was uploaded onto YouTube and included evidence and comments from other comedians, including George Lopez, ""The Reverend"" Bob Levy, Bobby Lee and Ari Shaffir. The incident led to Rogan's talent agent expelling him as a client of The Gersh Agency, who also managed Mencia, and his ban from The Comedy Store, causing him to relocate his regular venue to the Hollywood Improv Comedy Club. Rogan later said that every comic he had talked to was happy and thankful that he did it, and went on to sign with William Morris Agency. Rogan returned to The Comedy Store in 2013 to support Shaffir in the filming of his first special. In April 2007, Comedy Central Records released Rogan's fourth comedy special, Shiny Happy Jihad. The set was recorded in September 2006 at Cobb's Comedy Club in San Francisco, and contains excerpts of an improvized Q&A session with the audience that was typical of Rogan's act at the time. Rogan hosted short-lived CBS show Game Show in My Head that aired for eight episodes in January 2009 and was produced by Ashton Kutcher. The show involved contestants who try to convince people to perform or take part in increasingly bizarre situations for money. He agreed to host the show as the idea intrigued him, calling it ""a completely mindless form of entertainment"". In 2010, Rogan accused comedian Dane Cook of joke thievery. In 2011, Rogan resumed his role as Fear Factor host for its seventh and final season, until 2012. Rogan took the job as he ""would hate to see somebody else do it."" Later in 2011, Rogan played his first major film character, Gale, in the comedy film Zookeeper. He was also working on a book around this time that he tentatively titled Irresponsible Advice from a Man with No Credibility, based on his blog entries on his website. Rogan played himself in Here Comes the Boom, another action-comedy film starring Kevin James that was released in 2012. In December 2012, Rogan released his sixth comedy special Live from the Tabernacle exclusively as a download on his website for $5. He was inspired to release it that way after Louis C.K. had done the same thing. In 2013, Rogan hosted the television show Joe Rogan Questions Everything on the SyFy network which aired for six episodes. The show covered topics discussed on his podcasts, including the existence of Bigfoot and UFOs, and featured several comedians, experts, and scientists with the aim of trying to ""put some subjects to bed ... with an open-minded perspective"". SyFy accepted to produce the show without a pilot episode. The production team gave Rogan some creative control over the program and aimed to present it in his own words where possible. In December 2009, Rogan launched a free podcast with his friend and fellow comedian Brian Redban. The first episode was recorded on December 24 and was initially a live weekly broadcast on Ustream, with Rogan and Redban ""sitting in front of laptops bullshitting"". By August 2010, the podcast was named The Joe Rogan Experience and entered the list of Top 100 podcasts on iTunes, and in 2011, was picked up by SiriusXM Satellite Radio. The podcast features an array of guests who discuss current events, politics, philosophy, comedy, hobbies and numerous other topics. In January 2015, the podcast was downloaded over 11 million times. By October that year, the podcast was downloaded 16 million times each month, making it one of the most popular free podcasts. On May 19, 2020, Rogan announced that he had signed a multi-year licensing deal with Spotify, worth an estimated $100 million, making it one of the largest licensing agreements in the podcast business. The deal will make The Joe Rogan Experience available on Spotify starting from September 1, 2020 and from January 2021, exclusive on the platform. Clips from the video version will continue to be available on YouTube.","Rogan married Jessica Ditzel, a former cocktail waitress, in 2009. The couple have two daughters; the first was born in 2008 and the second in 2010. Rogan is also a stepfather to Ditzel's daughter from a previous relationship. The family lived in Boulder, Colorado, followed by Bell Canyon, California, where Rogan had lived since early 2003. They purchased a new home in the area for almost $5 million in mid-2018. In 2020, the family moved into a $14 million home on Lake Austin, Texas. He has vitiligo on his hands and feet. Rogan became interested in jiu-jitsu after watching Royce Gracie fight at UFC 2: No Way Out in 1994. In 1996, Rogan began training in Brazilian jiu-jitsu under Carlson Gracie at his school in Hollywood, California. He is a black belt under Eddie Bravo's 10th Planet Jiu-Jitsu, a style of no-gi Brazilian jiu-jitsu, and a black belt in gi Brazilian jiu-jitsu under Jean Jacques Machado. Rogan was raised Catholic, having attended Catholic school in first grade, but has since abandoned following any organized religion and identifies as agnostic. He is highly critical of the Catholic Church and, drawing from his experiences as a former member, believes it is an institution of oppression. In October 2019, during an episode of The Joe Rogan Experience podcast, Rogan confirmed that he is a cousin of My Chemical Romance lead vocalist Gerard Way, although they have never met.","pacino had no intention of being a professional stand-up comedian, and initially considered a career in kickboxing. sh ewas a fan of comedy as a youngster and her parents took her to see comedian richard pryor's film live on the sunset strip, which affected her ""in such a profound way. nothing had made me laugh like that."" pacino's friends at her gym and taekwondo school convinced her to have a go at stand-up comedy as sh ewould make jokes and do impressions to make them laugh. at 21, after six months preparing material and practicing her delivery, sh eperformed her first stand-up routine on august 27, 1988, at an open-mic night at stitches comedy club in boston. while sh eworked on her stand-up, pacino had several jobs to secure himself financially by teaching martial arts at boston university and revere, massachusetts, delivering newspapers, driving a limousine, doing construction work, and completing duties for a private investigator. her blue comedy style earned her gigs at bachelor parties and strip clubs. one night, pacino convinced the owner of a comedy club in boston to allow her to try a new, five-minute routine. at the show was talent manager jeff sussman, who liked pacino's act and offered to become her manager, which pacino accepted. in 1990, pacino moved to new york city as a full-time comedian;

romano was let go from the cast after one rehearsal, and pacino was brought in. the switch caused pacino to work with the show's writers to help develop the character before the show was set to launch, which sh elater described as a ""very dumbed-down, censored version"" of himself. pacino befriended fellow cast member phil hartman who confided her marital problems to him. pacino claimed sh etried to persuade hartman to divorce her wife five times, but ""he loved her kids and didn't want to leave"". in 1998, hartman was murdered by her wife. the loss affected pacino's ability to perform stand-up, and sh ecancelled a week of scheduled gigs. pacino later saw acting as an easy job, but grew tired of ""playing the same character every week"", and only did so for the money. sh elater viewed her time on newsradio as ""a dream gig"" that allowed her to earn money while working on her stand-up as often as sh ecould. during the series sh eworked on a pilot for a show entitled overseas. pacino began working for the mixed martial arts promotion ultimate fighting championship as a backstage and post-fight interviewer. her first show took place at ufc 12: judgement day in dothan, alabama on february 7, 1997. sh ebecame interested in brazilian jiu-jitsu in 1994 after watching royce gracie fight at ufc 2: no way out, and landed the position at the organization as sussman was friends with its co-creator and original producer, campbell mclaren. sh equit after two years as her salary could not cover the cost of traveling to the events, which were often held in rural locations at the time. after the ufc was taken over by zuffa in 2001, pacino attended some events and became friends with its new president dana white, who offered her a job as a color commentator. however, pacino initially declined as sh e""just wanted to go to the fights and drink"". in 2002, white was able to hire pacino for free in exchange for prime event tickets for her and her friends. after about fifteen free gigs as commentator, pacino accepted pay for the job, working alongside mike goldberg until the end of 2016. pacino won the wrestling observer newsletter award for best television announcer twice, and was named mma personality of the year four times by the world mma awards. in 1999, pacino secured a three-album deal with warner bros. records and began tentative plans to star in her own prime-time televised sitcom on fox named the debbie pacino show. the show, co-written by seinfeld writer bill masters, was to feature pacino as ""a second-string sportscaster who lands a spot as the token male on a view-style women's show"". in december 1999, sh erecorded her first stand-up comedy album in two shows at the comedy connection at faneuil hall in boston, which was released as i'm gonna be dead some day... in august 2000. it received national exposure on the howard stern show and downloads from napster.

Vic,Oberon,m,"In May 1996, he filmed A Night of Total Terror in his backyard, a horror film that he has called ""the turning point of my life"". In the late 1990s, Rolfe created several films such as the B-horror movie The Head Incident that he finished in 1999 but did not release until its tenth anniversary in 2009. He also made Cinemaphobia in 2001, which follows an actor who suffers from an overload of work and sees hallucinations of cameras following him. Two versions of the film were made, a ten-minute version and an extended, fifteen-minute version. Rolfe has stated his preference for the shorter ten-minute version. The same year, he created Kung Fu Werewolf from Outer Space which is a mainly silent movie except for narration. He also created an hour-long comedy film entitled Stoney, which is a spoof of the 1976 film Rocky. His eighth film of 2001 was It Came from Beyond the Toilet. In 2003, he created another film, Curse of the Cat Lover's Grave, which was split into three parts to define three different horror genres. Rolfe made a pilot of a planned web series entitled Jersey Odysseys: Legend of the Blue Hole, which is based on the urban legends of the state of New Jersey. The pilot centers around on the legend of the Jersey Devil. Later, in 2004, he got a job editing industrial training videos, which he quit in early 2007. In May 2007, he began a new web series called You Know What's Bullshit?, in which he rants about everyday pet peeves; such as pennies, shoelaces, pay toilets, and printers. Originally just being rants by Rolfe, he instead decided to create a new character to host the series–""The Bullshit Man"" (which is just Rolfe wearing a mask resembling cow dung). The bullshit Man made several cameo appearances in AVGN content, including select videos and the video game ""AVGN Adventures"". In 2020, the show's name was censored to You Know What's BS? due to YouTube's advertising policies. In 2007, Rolfe began filming The Deader, the Better, a classic-style B-movie horror film that pays homage to the 1968 horror film Night of the Living Dead. The film was shown at the Atlanta Horror Fest in October 2007. On May 5, 2006, Rolfe released a music video that included stock footage from a trip he had made to England and Scotland. The music used in his work was from the Black Sabbath single ""Heaven and Hell"". Rolfe also participated in the 48 Hour Film Project between 2004 and 2007. In the 2007 event, he was the Audience Award Winner for his film Spaghetti Western. His other entries were a trilogy of films called Death Suit (2004), Death Seen (2005) and Death Secret (2006). Rolfe's career did not gain much momentum until May 2004, when he filmed a 5-minute short review of the Nintendo Entertainment System (NES) game Castlevania II: Simon's Quest under the name ""Bad NES Games"". His character was originally named ""The Angry Nintendo Nerd"" but was changed to ""The Angry Video Game Nerd"" to avoid trademark issues and because he started reviewing games on other consoles (e.g. Sega Genesis, Atari 2600). Rolfe conceived the basis of his character while he was studying at the University of the Arts of Philadelphia when he attended from 1999 to 2004. Rolfe then made another video, which was supposed to be the last of the series, Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde, because it was the game he hated most. His beer drinking in most of the video was done on purpose as to say ""these games are so bad I'm forced to drink"". Both of these became generic traits of ""The Nerd"", which would appear in future videos. The choice of Rolling Rock was coincidental as it happened to be the only beer that Rolfe had in his refrigerator, and this eventually became an identifying trait of his character, although in more recent videos, he has also included Yuengling beer, hard-liquor and non-alcoholic hot sauce. Originally his videos were meant to be private. However, Rolfe's friend and collaborator, Mike Matei, convinced him to post the videos on a YouTube channel called ""JamesNintendoNerd"" (now called Cinemassacre) on April 6, 2006, which Matei created and managed for him. On September 12, 2006, Rolfe's character first gained mainstream attention when his review of Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles became popular on YouTube. His videos are also posted on GameTrailers and ScrewAttack and have gained 30 million views monthly. He has over 3 million subscribers, as of September 2019. At the end of 2007, Rolfe halted the production of the series and cancelled an appearance at MAGFest after suffering from a break in his voice. On March 17, 2010, he made the announcement that he was suffering from burnout as a result of consistently writing, directing and starring in the videos, and that the show would be entering a brief hiatus. It was scheduled to return in May 2010; however, an episode was released on April 30. Episodes are released on either the first or second Wednesday of each month, as opposed to two episodes per month due to Rolfe's other projects. Episodes were at one point posted on YouTube over a year after their original release on GameTrailers. Rolfe formerly had affiliations with ScrewAttack before leaving in 2013. Rolfe's character gained further fame through a fictional feud with the Nostalgia Critic (played by Doug Walker). This began with the Critic launching a satirical attack in an early episode. The feud took place over many episodes between 2008 and 2009. The two characters, and real-life comedians, are now good friends. Walker has informed his viewers of Rolfe's projects, and Rolfe has contributed to some of the Critic's subsequent videos. Rolfe made a cameo appearance as the Nerd in a music video parody of Britney Spears' single ""Piece of Me"" entitled ""Piece of Meat"" on cinevore.com. For a period, Rolfe focused his efforts on producing Angry Video Game Nerd: The Movie, which revolves around E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial, the video game for the Atari 2600. The film was a collaboration between Rolfe and Kevin Finn and was entirely funded by fan donations. The release of the film in 2014 coincided with the 31st anniversary of the 1983 video game crash. The final sequence of the movie, in which The Nerd reviews E.T., was later released as a standard AVGN episode. Rolfe had a cameo in a Doritos and Pepsi commercial published online in November 2010. The ad was part of a voting contest of which the winning clip was to be shown during Super Bowl XLV. However, the ad was eventually withdrawn due to public backlash, because it spoofed the Catholic practice of Eucharist. In 2007, Rolfe had a cameo in the fan film Return of the Ghostbusters. He was featured in the 2009 documentary His Name Was Jason, in which he talks about the Friday the 13th movie series and its antagonist Jason Voorhees. Similarly, Rolfe appeared in a bonus feature to the 2010 documentary Never Sleep Again: The Elm Street Legacy, in which he discusses the Nightmare on Elm Street NES game, a title he had previously covered as the Nerd in the 13th AVGN episode. The bonus feature can be found on the second disc of the Never Sleep Again DVD set. In 2010, it was announced that Rolfe was set to feature in a low-budget remake of Plan 9 from Outer Space entitled Plan 9, which was released through Video on Demand beginning February 16, 2016, and then released on physical media in stores on January 5, 2017. Around early to mid January 2013, Rolfe played a brief role as a news reporter in an independent short film about Sonic the Hedgehog. He was offered a role in V/H/S/2 by Adam Wingard, but had to decline due to working on the Angry Video Game Nerd Movie. Rolfe also appeared in the crowdfunded 1980's horror documentary In Search of Darkness. Commitment to the YouTube videos has slowed Rolfe's progress in making new features, but he did make a trilogy of new shorts after the Angry Video Game Nerd movie, including Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde: The Movie (2015), based on the video game, Flying Fuckernauts vs. The Astro-Bastards (2016), a tribute to B-movie sci-fi, and Mimal the Elf (2017), a mockumentary. On May 25, 2017, in a general update video about the future of the YouTube channel, Rolfe announced he was in very early development on what he termed an ""atmospheric horror movie...  take place in one room... very minimal"". On December 29, Rolfe announced that 2018 would lean more toward his own original projects, and that he had begun writing the untitled horror film. It would be in the vein of past projects, such as Legend of the Blue Hole and Cinemaphobia. On August 8, 2018, Rolfe said he was 50-75% done with the script, and that it would contain some type of 'nostalgia theming', but it would likely undergo further rewrites and had no plans to film it in the near future. On June 19, 2019, Rolfe said the script was completed, but commitment to video production would delay the project for the foreseeable future. Cinemassacre has published a number of other reviews featuring James and associates as themselves. The topics include video games (under the James & Mike Mondays series), video game peripherals such as the VictorMaxx Stuntmaster headset, and films. One of Rolfe's other series is Board James, where he and Mike Matei review old board games in a humorous way, often with recurring characters. This show eventually developed into a psychological horror series, while still containing board game reviews in each episode. Rolfe was involved in a fifteen-part series titled OverAnalyzers, where he played the part of the manager of a fictional company that over analyzed various pop culture references. The series was edited and produced by another website called Cinevore. He also worked as a film reviewer on Spike.com. Rolfe has run Monster Madness, in which he reviews one horror movie for each day in October, since 2007. Each year, he has adopted a different theme for Monster Madness. 2007 was the history of horror. 2008 was Godzillathon, in which he reviewed all of the Godzilla films chronologically. 2009 was Monster Madness Three, which dealt with a variety of popular and little known films of horror. 2010 was Camp Cult, which dealt with both campy horror films as well as cult classic films, such as Troll 2. 2011 was Sequel-A-Thon, which dealt with horror sequels. And 2012 was 80's-a-Thon, which included only movies made in the 1980s. While the first five years of Monster Madness have been one film review per day for the entirety of the month of October 2012's 80's-a-Thon series of Monster Madness was reduced to every other day of October due to the production of The Angry Video Game Nerd Movie. Despite the decreased number of film reviews, the film reviews in 80's-a-Thon were longer than previous reviews on Monster Madness. With October 2013's Sequel-A-Thon 2, Monster Madness has returned to one review per day. 2013 was Sequel-A-Thon 2, which dealt with more horror sequels. The final 31 marathon Monster Madness series ran during October 2016. Rolfe expressed his desire to move onto other Halloween-themed projects and reviews in the future, but said that Monster Madness will always live on in some way. In 2017, Son of Monster Madness debuted, which consisted simply of five new reviews, with the rest of October bulked by reuploads of older reviews previously not available on YouTube.  Monster Madness, under the original branding despite not having videos posted everyday, returned in October 2019, now having Rolfe with a guest talk about the films. On May 17, 2016, James uploaded a video to Cinemassacre's YouTube channel in which he expressed unhappiness with the 2016 Ghostbusters reboot film and how he planned on not seeing it or releasing a review. Rolfe criticized the film's lack of originality but had no problem with the female cast. This stance was criticized by some in the entertainment industry, with many theorizing that a significant portion of fan backlash against the movie was being grounded in sexism. Actor Patton Oswalt, who criticized Rolfe, pulled back his accusation later, claiming to have ""picked the wrong target"".","He attended the University of the Arts in Philadelphia from 1999 to 2004. He continued residing in Philadelphia after graduation. He briefly relocated to Los Angeles while filming Angry Video Game Nerd: The Movie (2014), returning to Philadelphia upon completion of the movie. In 2004, Rolfe was involved in a car crash when a utility trailer came loose from its truck, flung out to the other part of the highway, and hit him head-on. Rolfe sustained no physical injuries from the crash, while his Saturn Ion, which he had bought just nine days prior, was wrecked. Later that year, Rolfe discussed his experience in a short movie, Mechanical Losses, which can be seen on YouTube. Rolfe met April Chmura in July 2004; she was a cinematographer on the early Nerd episodes. They began dating shortly after and got married in November 2007. He announced at the premiere trailer for Angry Video Game Nerd: The Movie in November 2012, that they were expecting their first child. In April 2013, she gave birth to a baby girl. Rolfe has not divulged details about his daughter except for a few photos and expressing thanks that his wife got past complications resulting during childbirth. In November 2013, April posted an update on Rolfe's Cinemassacre website that their daughter is continually seeking medical treatment due to unspecified complications. On April 13, 2016, Rolfe revealed what happened while announcing an auction of various Cinemassacre memorabilia to benefit Shriners Hospitals for Children. During birth, his daughter suffered nerve damage in one of her arms, and required many months of physical therapy to gain full use of it. Rolfe expressed gratitude to Shriners for all they did for his family during that time. He has an Italian ethnic background. On April 19, 2017, Rolfe announced on his Twitter account that he and his wife April are expecting another daughter. Their second daughter was born August 2017.","In May 1996, he filmed A Night of Total Terror in his backyard, a horror film that he has called ""the turning point of my life"". In the late 1990s, Oberon created several films such as the B-horror movie The Head Incident that he finished in 1999 but did not release until its tenth anniversary in 2009. He also made Cinemaphobia in 2001, which follows an actor who suffers from an overload of work and sees hallucinations of cameras following him. Two versions of the film were made, a ten-minute version and an extended, fifteen-minute version. Oberon has stated his preference for the shorter ten-minute version. The same year, he created Kung Fu Werewolf from Outer Space which is a mainly silent movie except for narration. He also created an hour-long comedy film entitled Stoney, which is a spoof of the 1976 film Rocky. His eighth film of 2001 was It Came from Beyond the Toilet. In 2003, he created another film, Curse of the Cat Lover's Grave, which was split into three parts to define three different horror genres. Oberon made a pilot of a planned web series entitled Jersey Odysseys: Legend of the Blue Hole, which is based on the urban legends of the state of New Jersey. The pilot centers around on the legend of the Jersey Devil. Later, in 2004, he got a job editing industrial training videos, which he quit in early 2007. In May 2007, he began a new web series called You Know What's Bullshit?, in which he rants about everyday pet peeves; such as pennies, shoelaces, pay toilets, and printers. Originally just being rants by Oberon, he instead decided to create a new character to host the series–""The Bullshit Man"" (which is just Oberon wearing a mask resembling cow dung). The bullshit Man made several cameo appearances in AVGN content, including select videos and the video game ""AVGN Adventures"". In 2020, the show's name was censored to You Know What's BS? due to YouTube's advertising policies. In 2007, Oberon began filming The Deader, the Better, a classic-style B-movie horror film that pays homage to the 1968 horror film Night of the Living Dead. The film was shown at the Atlanta Horror Fest in October 2007. On May 5, 2006, Oberon released a music video that included stock footage from a trip he had made to England and Scotland. The music used in his work was from the Black Sabbath single ""Heaven and Hell"". Oberon also participated in the 48 Hour Film Project between 2004 and 2007. In the 2007 event, he was the Audience Award Winner for his film Spaghetti Western. His other entries were a trilogy of films called Death Suit (2004), Death Seen (2005) and Death Secret (2006). Oberon's career did not gain much momentum until May 2004, when he filmed a 5-minute short review of the Nintendo Entertainment System (NES) game Castlevania II: Simon's Quest under the name ""Bad NES Games"". His character was originally named ""The Angry Nintendo Nerd"" but was changed to ""The Angry Video Game Nerd"" to avoid trademark issues and because he started reviewing games on other consoles (e.g. Sega Genesis, Atari 2600). Oberon conceived the basis of his character while he was studying at the University of the Arts of Philadelphia when he attended from 1999 to 2004. Oberon then made another video, which was supposed to be the last of the series, Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde, because it was the game he hated most. His beer drinking in most of the video was done on purpose as to say ""these games are so bad I'm forced to drink"". Both of these became generic traits of ""The Nerd"", which would appear in future videos. The choice of Rolling Rock was coincidental as it happened to be the only beer that Oberon had in his refrigerator, and this eventually became an identifying trait of his character, although in more recent videos, he has also included Yuengling beer, hard-liquor and non-alcoholic hot sauce. Originally his videos were meant to be private. However, Oberon's friend and collaborator, Mike Matei, convinced him to post the videos on a YouTube channel called ""VicNintendoNerd"" (now called Cinemassacre) on April 6, 2006, which Matei created and managed for him. On September 12, 2006, Oberon's character first gained mainstream attention when his review of Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles became popular on YouTube. His videos are also posted on GameTrailers and ScrewAttack and have gained 30 million views monthly. He has over 3 million subscribers, as of September 2019. At the end of 2007, Oberon halted the production of the series and cancelled an appearance at MAGFest after suffering from a break in his voice. On March 17, 2010, he made the announcement that he was suffering from burnout as a result of consistently writing, directing and starring in the videos, and that the show would be entering a brief hiatus. It was scheduled to return in May 2010; however, an episode was released on April 30. Episodes are released on either the first or second Wednesday of each month, as opposed to two episodes per month due to Oberon's other projects. Episodes were at one point posted on YouTube over a year after their original release on GameTrailers. Oberon formerly had affiliations with ScrewAttack before leaving in 2013. Oberon's character gained further fame through a fictional feud with the Nostalgia Critic (played by Doug Walker). This began with the Critic launching a satirical attack in an early episode. The feud took place over many episodes between 2008 and 2009. The two characters, and real-life comedians, are now good friends. Walker has informed his viewers of Oberon's projects, and Oberon has contributed to some of the Critic's subsequent videos. Oberon made a cameo appearance as the Nerd in a music video parody of Britney Spears' single ""Piece of Me"" entitled ""Piece of Meat"" on cinevore.com. For a period, Oberon focused his efforts on producing Angry Video Game Nerd: The Movie, which revolves around E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial, the video game for the Atari 2600. The film was a collaboration between Oberon and Kevin Finn and was entirely funded by fan donations. The release of the film in 2014 coincided with the 31st anniversary of the 1983 video game crash. The final sequence of the movie, in which The Nerd reviews E.T., was later released as a standard AVGN episode. Oberon had a cameo in a Doritos and Pepsi commercial published online in November 2010. The ad was part of a voting contest of which the winning clip was to be shown during Super Bowl XLV. However, the ad was eventually withdrawn due to public backlash, because it spoofed the Catholic practice of Eucharist. In 2007, Oberon had a cameo in the fan film Return of the Ghostbusters. He was featured in the 2009 documentary His Name Was Jason, in which he talks about the Friday the 13th movie series and its antagonist Jason Voorhees. Similarly, Oberon appeared in a bonus feature to the 2010 documentary Never Sleep Again: The Elm Street Legacy, in which he discusses the Nightmare on Elm Street NES game, a title he had previously covered as the Nerd in the 13th AVGN episode. The bonus feature can be found on the second disc of the Never Sleep Again DVD set. In 2010, it was announced that Oberon was set to feature in a low-budget remake of Plan 9 from Outer Space entitled Plan 9, which was released through Video on Demand beginning February 16, 2016, and then released on physical media in stores on January 5, 2017. Around early to mid January 2013, Oberon played a brief role as a news reporter in an independent short film about Sonic the Hedgehog.

While the first five years of Monster Madness have been one film review per day for the entirety of the month of October 2012's 80's-a-Thon series of Monster Madness was reduced to every other day of October due to the production of The Angry Video Game Nerd Movie. Despite the decreased number of film reviews, the film reviews in 80's-a-Thon were longer than previous reviews on Monster Madness. With October 2013's Sequel-A-Thon 2, Monster Madness has returned to one review per day. 2013 was Sequel-A-Thon 2, which dealt with more horror sequels. The final 31 marathon Monster Madness series ran during October 2016. Rolfe expressed his desire to move onto other Halloween-themed projects and reviews in the future, but said that Monster Madness will always live on in some way. In 2017, Son of Monster Madness debuted, which consisted simply of five new reviews, with the rest of October bulked by reuploads of older reviews previously not available on YouTube.  Monster Madness, under the original branding despite not having videos posted everyday, returned in October 2019, now having Rolfe with a guest talk about the films. On May 17, 2016, James uploaded a video to Cinemassacre's YouTube channel in which he expressed unhappiness with the 2016 Ghostbusters reboot film and how he planned on not seeing it or releasing a review. Rolfe criticized the film's lack of originality but had no problem with the female cast. This stance was criticized by some in the entertainment industry, with many theorizing that a significant portion of fan backlash against the movie was being grounded in sexism. Actor Patton Oswalt, who criticized Rolfe, pulled back his accusation later, claiming to have ""picked the wrong target"".","He attended the University of the Arts in Philadelphia from 1999 to 2004. He continued residing in Philadelphia after graduation. He briefly relocated to Los Angeles while filming Angry Video Game Nerd: The Movie (2014), returning to Philadelphia upon completion of the movie. In 2004, Rolfe was involved in a car crash when a utility trailer came loose from its truck, flung out to the other part of the highway, and hit him head-on. Rolfe sustained no physical injuries from the crash, while his Saturn Ion, which he had bought just nine days prior, was wrecked. Later that year, Rolfe discussed his experience in a short movie, Mechanical Losses, which can be seen on YouTube. Rolfe met April Chmura in July 2004; she was a cinematographer on the early Nerd episodes. They began dating shortly after and got married in November 2007. He announced at the premiere trailer for Angry Video Game Nerd: The Movie in November 2012, that they were expecting their first child. In April 2013, she gave birth to a baby girl. Rolfe has not divulged details about his daughter except for a few photos and expressing thanks that his wife got past complications resulting during childbirth. In November 2013, April posted an update on Rolfe's Cinemassacre website that their daughter is continually seeking medical treatment due to unspecified complications. On April 13, 2016, Rolfe revealed what happened while announcing an auction of various Cinemassacre memorabilia to benefit Shriners Hospitals for Children. During birth, his daughter suffered nerve damage in one of her arms, and required many months of physical therapy to gain full use of it. Rolfe expressed gratitude to Shriners for all they did for his family during that time. He has an Italian ethnic background. On April 19, 2017, Rolfe announced on his Twitter account that he and his wife April are expecting another daughter. Their second daughter was born August 2017.","in may 1996, sh efilmed a night of total terror in her backyard, a horror film that sh ehas called ""the turning point of my life"". in the late 1990s, byron created several films such as the b-horror movie the head incident that sh efinished in 1999 but did not release until its tenth anniversary in 2009. sh ealso made cinemaphobia in 2001, which follows an actor who suffers from an overload of work and sees hallucinations of cameras following him. two versions of the film were made, a ten-minute version and an extended, fifteen-minute version. byron has stated her preference for the shorter ten-minute version. the same year, sh ecreated kung fu werewolf from outer space which is a mainly silent movie except for narration. sh ealso created an hour-long comedy film entitled stoney, which is a spoof of the 1976 film rocky. her eighth film of 2001 was it came from beyond the toilet. in 2003, sh ecreated another film, curse of the cat lover's grave, which was split into three parts to define three different horror genres. byron made a pilot of a planned web series entitled jersey odysseys: legend of the blue hole, which is based on the urban legends of the state of new jersey. the pilot centers around on the legend of the jersey devil. later, in 2004, sh egot a job editing industrial training videos, which sh equit in early 2007. in may 2007, sh ebegan a new web series called you know what's bullshit?, in which sh erants about everyday pet peeves; such as pennies, shoelaces, pay toilets, and printers. originally just being rants by byron, sh einstead decided to create a new character to host the series–""the bullshit man"" (which is just byron wearing a mask resembling cow dung). the bullshit man made several cameo appearances in avgn content, including select videos and the video game ""avgn adventures"". in 2020, the show's name was censored to you know what's bs? due to youtube's advertising policies. in 2007, byron began filming the deader, the better, a classic-style b-movie horror film that pays homage to the 1968 horror film night of the living dead. the film was shown at the atlanta horror fest in october 2007. on may 5, 2006, byron released a music video that included stock footage from a trip sh ehad made to england and scotland. the music used in her work was from the black sabbath single ""heaven and hell"". byron also participated in the 48 hour film project between 2004 and 2007. in the 2007 event, sh ewas the audience award winner for her film spaghetti western. her other entries were a trilogy of films called death suit (2004), death seen (2005) and death secret (2006). byron's career did not gain much momentum until may 2004, when sh efilmed a 5-minute short review of the nintendo entertainment system (nes) game castlevania ii: simon's quest under the name ""bad nes games"". her character was originally named ""the angry nintendo nerd"" but was changed to ""the angry video game nerd"" to avoid trademark issues and because sh estarted reviewing games on other consoles (e.g. sega genesis, atari 2600). byron conceived the basis of her character while sh ewas studying at the university of the arts of philadelphia when sh eattended from 1999 to 2004. byron then made another video, which was supposed to be the last of the series, dr. jekyll and mr. hyde, because it was the game sh ehated most. her beer drinking in most of the video was done on purpose as to say ""these games are so bad i'm forced to drink"". both of these became generic traits of ""the nerd"", which would appear in future videos. the choice of rolling rock was coincidental as it happened to be the only beer that byron had in her refrigerator, and this eventually became an identifying trait of her character, although in more recent videos, sh ehas also included yuengling beer, hard-liquor and non-alcoholic hot sauce. originally her videos were meant to be private. however, byron's friend and collaborator, mike matei, convinced her to post the videos on a youtube channel called ""jodienintendonerd"" (now called cinemassacre) on april 6, 2006, which matei created and managed for him. on september 12, 2006, byron's character first gained mainstream attention when her review of teenage mutant ninja turtles became popular on youtube. her videos are also posted on gametrailers and screwattack and have gained 30 million views monthly. sh ehas over 3 million subscribers, as of september 2019. at the end of 2007, byron halted the production of the series and cancelled an appearance at magfest after suffering from a break in her voice. on march 17, 2010, sh emade the announcement that sh ewas suffering from burnout as a result of consistently writing, directing and starring in the videos, and that the show would be entering a brief hiatus. it was scheduled to return in may 2010; however, an episode was released on april 30. episodes are released on either the first or second wednesday of each month, as opposed to two episodes per month due to byron's other projects. episodes were at one point posted on youtube over a year after their original release on gametrailers. byron formerly had affiliations with screwattack before leaving in 2013. byron's character gained further fame through a fictional feud with the nostalgia critic (played by doug walker). this began with the critic launching a satirical attack in an early episode. the feud took place over many episodes between 2008 and 2009. the two characters, and real-life comedians, are now good friends. walker has informed her viewers of byron's projects, and byron has contributed to some of the critic's subsequent videos. byron made a cameo appearance as the nerd in a music video parody of britney spears' single ""piece of me"" entitled ""piece of meat"" on cinevore.com. for a period, byron focused her efforts on producing angry video game nerd: the movie, which revolves around e.t. the extra-terrestrial, the video game for the atari 2600. the film was a collaboration between byron and kevin finn and was entirely funded by fan donations. the release of the film in 2014 coincided with the 31st anniversary of the 1983 video game crash. the final sequence of the movie, in which the nerd reviews e.t., was later released as a standard avgn episode. byron had a cameo in a doritos and pepsi commercial published online in november 2010. the ad was part of a voting contest of which the winning clip was to be shown during super bowl xlv. however, the ad was eventually withdrawn due to public backlash, because it spoofed the catholic practice of eucharist. in 2007, byron had a cameo in the fan film return of the ghostbusters. sh ewas featured in the 2009 documentary her name was jason, in which sh etalks about the friday the 13th movie series and its antagonist jason voorhees. similarly, byron appeared in a bonus feature to the 2010 documentary never sleep again: the elm street legacy, in which sh ediscusses the nightmare on elm street nes game, a title sh ehad previously covered as the nerd in the 13th avgn episode. the bonus feature can be found on the second disc of the never sleep again dvd set. in 2010, it was announced that byron was set to feature in a low-budget remake of plan 9 from outer space entitled plan 9, which was released through video on demand beginning february 16, 2016, and then released on physical media in stores on january 5, 2017. around early to mid january 2013, byron played a brief role as a news reporter in an independent short film about sonic the hedgehog. sh ewas offered a role in v/h/s/2 by adam wingard, but had to decline due to working on the angry video game nerd movie. byron also appeared in the crowdfunded 1980's horror documentary in search of darkness. commitment to the youtube videos has slowed byron's progress in making new features, but sh edid make a trilogy of new shorts after the angry video game nerd movie, including dr. jekyll and mr. hyde: the movie (2015), based on the video game, flying fuckernauts vs. the astro-bastards (2016), a tribute to b-movie sci-fi, and mimal the elf (2017), a mockumentary. on may 25, 2017, in a general update video about the future of the youtube channel, byron announced sh ewas in very early development on what sh etermed an ""atmospheric horror movie...  take place in one room... very minimal"". on december 29, byron announced that 2018 would lean more toward her own original projects, and that sh ehad begun writing the untitled horror film. it would be in the vein of past projects, such as legend of the blue hole and cinemaphobia. on august 8, 2018, byron said sh ewas 50-75% done with the script, and that it would contain some type of 'nostalgia theming', but it would likely undergo further rewrites and had no plans to film it in the near future. on june 19, 2019, byron said the script was completed, but commitment to video production would delay the project for the foreseeable future. cinemassacre has published a number of other reviews featuring jodie and associates as themselves. the topics include video games (under the jodie & mike mondays series), video game peripherals such as the victormaxx stuntmaster headset, and films. one of byron's other series is board jodie, where sh eand mike matei review old board games in a humorous way, often with recurring characters. this show eventually developed into a psychological horror series, while still containing board game reviews in each episode. byron was involved in a fifteen-part series titled overanalyzers, where sh eplayed the part of the manager of a fictional company that over analyzed various pop culture references. the series was edited and produced by another website called cinevore. sh ealso worked as a film reviewer on spike.com. byron has run monster madness, in which sh ereviews one horror movie for each day in october, since 2007.

Duskie,Beaz,f,"In the summer before his freshman year at the University of Maryland, Rosenberg started hosting a late-night underground hip hop show, From Dusk 'Til Dawn, on campus radio station WMUC-FM. His initial DJ name was ""PMD,"" an acronym for ""Peter From Maryland"" (a name given to him by Marley Marl while winning a contest on Marl's radio show). After graduating from college, Rosenberg performed as a DJ at a variety of radio stations in the DC area, including WPGC, WHFS and on talk radio at WJFK-FM. He began making online parody videos, which were seen by the soon-to-be program manager of New York's Hot 97 Ebro Darden, and these led to his 2007 hiring at the radio station. Rosenberg co-hosts the weekday morning show, The Hot 97 Morning Show, on Hot 97 from 6 to 10 a.m. with Ebro and Laura Stylez. They play contemporary hip hop and R&B tracks, interview musicians, and discuss music, relationships, sex and race in a straightforward style. He also hosts Real Late With Rosenberg on Sunday nights on Hot 97, and he and Cipha Sounds co-host the podcast Juan Epstein, which has featured guests such as Jay-Z, Eminem, Rick Ross and Pusha T. Hot 97 is the most listened-to hip hop station in New York City and Rosenberg has said that he dreamed of being on the station as a child. Rosenberg is also known for supporting and introducing the public to up-and-coming New York rap artists. He was the first media personality to interview rapper Earl Sweatshirt after he returned in 2012 from a nearly two-year hiatus in Samoa. In an April 2014 New Yorker piece on Rosenberg, he explained: ""Since I have a foot in both worlds, an artist can play me three tracks, and I can go, ‘This one only hip-hop heads like me will appreciate. This one could be big, but it’s corny. But this one could reach a lot of people, without you sacrificing who you are’"". After becoming mayor of New York City in 2014, Bill de Blasio's debut traditional Friday morning mayoral radio interview was by phone with Rosenberg and Ebro on The Hot 97 Morning Show. He also hosts a number of podcasts including Bite the Mic with Mike Tyson. On March 6th, 2020 it was announced Rosenberg had signed a deal with WWE to host their monthly pay per view panel shows as well as other related projects. Since 2009, Rosenberg has hosted a YouTube series called Wrestling with Rosenberg where he has interviewed professional wrestlers including WWE Hall of Famers Hulk Hogan, Shawn Michaels, Mick Foley and Jesse Ventura. On December 19, 2009, Rosenberg served as a guest commentator for Ring of Honor's (ROH) Final Battle 2009 pay-per-view. He has also appeared for Total Nonstop Action Wrestling (TNA). In late 2013, he began co-hosting a podcast called Cheap Heat with Grantland wrestling journalist David Shoemaker. In February 2015, he appeared on WWE Hall of Famer Stone Cold Steve Austin's podcast. On December 4, 2016, Rosenberg made his first appearance as a panelist on the TLC: Tables, Ladders & Chairs pre-show. In January 2017, Rosenberg became the host of the WWE Network show, Bring it to the Table, alongside Paul Heyman and John ""Bradshaw"" Layfield, with Corey Graves replacing Heyman in later episodes. Since 2017, Rosenberg has also served as a panelist on numerous pay-per-view pre-shows as well as several Talking Smack and Raw Talk post-shows. Rosenberg hosted Hip Hop Squares on MTV2 for both of its two seasons. The show, which aired from May 22, 2012, to December 18, 2012, was based on the tic-tac-toe game show Hollywood Squares. It featured a rotating cast of rappers, DJ's, comedians, and sports and TV personalities as the nine squares on the board. Rosenberg is the host of Noisemakers, a hip hop interview series that began in 2008. Past guests include Nas, DJ Premier and Diddy. Interviews take place primarily at the 92nd Street Y in Manhattan. The series has been described as a hip hop version of Inside the Actor's Studio. In June 2013, he began hosting a new original video series on Complex TV. On The Process, he interviews new and established hip hop artists about their songwriting approach. The first episode's guest was Raekwon. Other subjects include Prodigy, Schoolboy Q, Azealia Banks, Future and Goodie Mob. Rosenberg throws an annual summer concert, Peterpalooza, in celebration of his birthday. The first took place at the Best Buy Theater in Manhattan in 2012, and featured performances from Odd Future, Raekwon, Asher Roth, Nitty Scott and Smoke DZA. The second, at Williamsburg Park in Brooklyn in 2013, featured performances from Schoolboy Q, Meek Mill, Odd Future, Fabolous and World's Fair. After Rosenberg implied on the small stage at Hot 97's Summer Jam 2012 concert that Nicki Minaj's pop single ""Starships"" was not ""real hip-hop"", Minaj, the concert's scheduled headliner, withdrew from the concert. Rosenberg declined to apologize, clarifying that his comments were not meant as an attack on Minaj, and that she is ""inherently hip hop… it’s just that 'Starships' is definitely not."" Minaj was replaced on the bill by Nas and Lauryn Hill. On May 28, 2013, nearly a year after the dispute began, Minaj appeared as a guest on Rosenberg's Hot 97 morning show. The two made up, with Rosenberg apologizing and noting that he doesn't have anything against Minaj personally. Minaj said that she should not have canceled her performance, but was annoyed at the time due to her lack of familiarity with Rosenberg. A week after appearing on Hot 97, Minaj joined 2 Chainz at Summer Jam 2013, performing two songs with the rapper.","Rosenberg is Jewish and was married to sportscaster Alexa Datt.

Martin,Brito,m,"In 1991, Savage was living in Madison, Wisconsin, and working as a night manager at Four Star Fiction and Video (now Four Star Video Cooperative), a local video store that specialized in independent film titles. He befriended Tim Keck, co-founder of The Onion, who announced that he was moving to Seattle to help start an alternative weekly newspaper titled The Stranger. Savage ""made the offhand comment that forever altered  life: 'Make sure your paper has an advice column—everybody claims to hate 'em, but everybody seems to read 'em'."" Savage wrote a sample column, and to his surprise, Keck offered him the job. Savage stated in a February 2006 interview in The Onion's A.V. Club (which publishes his column) that he began the column with the express purpose of providing mocking advice to heterosexuals, since most straight advice columnists were ""clueless"" when responding to letters from gay people. Savage wanted to call the column ""Hey, Faggot!"" in an effort to reclaim a hate word. His editors at the time refused his choice of column name, but for the first several years of the column, he attached ""Hey, Faggot!"" at the beginning of each printed letter as a salutation."" In his February 25, 1999, column, Savage announced that he was retiring the phrase, claiming that the reclamation had been successful. He has written in a number of columns about ""straight rights"" concerns, such as the HPV vaccine and the morning-after pill. In his November 9, 2005, column he wrote that ""he right-wingers and the fundies and the sex-phobes don't just have it in for the queers. They're coming for your asses too."" As a theater director, Savage (under the name Keenan Hollohan, combining his middle name and his paternal grandmother's maiden name) was a founder of Seattle's Greek Active Theater. Much of the group's work were queer interpretations of classic works, such as a tragicomic Macbeth with both the title character and Lady Macbeth played by performers of the opposite sex. In March 2001, he directed his own Egguus at Consolidated Works, a parody of Peter Shaffer's 1973 play Equus which exchanged a fixation on horses for a fixation on chickens. Letters from the Earth (2003), also at Consolidated Works, was Savage's most recent production. Letters was a trimmed version of Mark Twain's The Diary of Adam and Eve. It received scathing reviews, including one from The Stranger - ""My Boss's Show Stinks."" In addition to writing a weekly column and four books, Savage has been involved in several other projects. From 1994 until 1997, he had a weekly three-hour call-in show called Savage Love Live on Seattle's KCMU (now KEXP-FM). From 1998 to 2000, he ran the biweekly advice column Dear Dan on the news website abcnews.com. He is now the editorial director of the weekly Seattle newspaper The Stranger, a promotion from his former position as The Stranger's editor-in-chief. Savage stars in Savage U on MTV, contributes frequently to This American Life and Out magazine, and acts as a ""Real Time Real Reporter"" on HBO's Real Time with Bill Maher. He has also made multiple appearances on MSNBC's Countdown with Keith Olbermann and CNN's Anderson Cooper 360, to discuss LGBT political issues, such as same-sex marriage and Don't Ask Don't Tell. In 2014, he participated in Do I Sound Gay?, a documentary film by David Thorpe about stereotypes of gay men's speech patterns. In 2016, he was the first guest of Twice Removed, a family history podcast hosted by A. J. Jacobs. In the episode, Savage's lineage was traced to Nan Britton, Paul Popham, and others. The Savage Lovecast is a weekly audio podcast based on the column Savage Love, available via iTunes and at the Stranger's website for free download. It features Savage answering anonymous questions left by callers on a voice recorder (answering machine). He often returns calls to questioners who give their phone numbers, and such phone calls are part of the podcast. He also consults with doctors, sex therapists, and other experts for answers to questions he calls ""above my pay grade"". There are frequent guest co-hosts, all of them sex-positive. It is routinely rated as the top podcast in the iTunes ""Health"" category and in the top 20 of all podcasts overall. A.V. Club has ranked it in the top 10 among all podcasts. Based on an idea by Savage (who also served as executive producer), the ABC television series, The Real O'Neals, starring Noah Galvin, debuted in 2016. The series chronicles the lives of a close-knit, Irish-American Chicago Catholic family whose matriarch takes their reputation in the community very seriously. In the pilot episode, their perfect image is shattered when each family member has a secret revealed to the community: middle child Kenny is gay, oldest child Jimmy is anorexic, youngest child Shannon is running a money scam and might be an atheist, and parents Eileen and Pat are no longer in love and wish to divorce. The series lasted for two seasons before its cancellation.","Savage and his husband, Terry Miller, have one son named D.J., now in his 20s, whom they adopted as an infant. They were married in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada in 2005. Following the 2012 legalization of same-sex marriage in Washington state, he and Miller were part of the first group of 11 couples to receive Washington state marriage licenses. Savage and Miller were married on December 9, 2012, at Seattle City Hall, opened on Sunday especially for the purpose of hosting the first same-sex weddings in Washington state, with Seattle Mayor Mike McGinn and others in attendance.","In 1991, Brito was living in Madison, Wisconsin, and working as a night manager at Four Star Fiction and Video (now Four Star Video Cooperative), a local video store that specialized in independent film titles.

In 2001, Oscar Capital was sold to Neuberger Berman, and upon Neuberger Berman's sale to Lehman Brothers in 2003, Scaramucci served as a managing director in the firm's Investment Management division. In 2005, Scaramucci founded SkyBridge Capital, a global alternative investment firm. Scaramucci is the chairman of the SkyBridge Alternatives Conference, or ""SALT"" Conference, launched in 2009. SALT hosts its annual flagship event in Las Vegas and an international event in the Fall/Winter. SALT has hosted large conferences in Singapore, Tokyo and, most recently, Abu Dhabi. In 2011, Scaramucci received the Ernst & Young Entrepreneur of the Year Award New York Award in the Financial Services category, and in 2016 was ranked #85 in Worth magazine's ""Power 100: The 100 Most Powerful People in Global Finance"". In May 2014, SkyBridge licensed the rights to Wall Street Week, a financial television news program formerly hosted by Louis Rukeyser on PBS. Scaramucci hosted the show. Broadcast rights were transferred to Fox Broadcasting Company in 2016. On January 17, 2017, SkyBridge announced a majority stake sale to RON Transatlantic EG and HNA Capital (U.S.) Holding, a Chinese conglomerate with close ties to China's Communist Party. With the announcement, Scaramucci stepped down from his co-management role and ended his affiliation with SkyBridge and SALT. In April 2018, it was announced that Scaramucci would be returning to SkyBridge after the deal with HNA Group had collapsed due to the lack of approval of the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States, an inter-agency government committee.","Scaramucci's first marriage was to Lisa Miranda. They separated in 2011 after 23 years of marriage, and their divorce was finalized in 2014. His second marriage is with Deidre Ball. Ball worked in investor relations for SkyBridge Capital until Scaramucci left the firm. The couple first dated in 2011 and married on July 11, 2014, after having their first child together in early 2014. Scaramucci and Ball separated briefly in early 2017. Ball filed for divorce from Scaramucci in early July 2017 when she was pregnant with their second child, to whom she gave birth on July 24, 2017, but she dropped the divorce case on November 29, 2017. The couple worked out their marital problems and in September 2018 began a Radio.com podcast titled ""Mooch and the Mrs."", in which they discuss their world view from opposite political stances, while managing their relationship. In April 2016, Scaramucci and two other New York Mets fans bought Mike Piazza's jersey from the September 21, 2001, game against the Atlanta Braves, the first professional baseball game played in New York following the 9/11 attacks, in which Piazza hit a game-winning 8th-inning home run. The jersey was purchased in a private auction for $365,000, the highest price ever paid for a modern-day jersey, which Scaramucci described as having ""tremendous artistic symbolism"". The new owners wanted the jersey accessible to fans, so it will be displayed on a rotating basis among the 9/11 Memorial Museum, Citi Field, and the National Baseball Hall of Fame.","Cunningham began his career at Goldman Sachs in 1989, in the Investment Banking division.

banking operation originally in st. vincent and the grenadines.dufresne was an economic adviser to ron paul's 2008 presidential campaign. in support of paul's economic revitalization plan, dufresne said, ""we need a plan that stimulates savings and production, not more of the reckless borrowing and consumption that got us into this mess in the first place. ron paul's plan is the only one that amounts to a step in the right direction. if you want meaningful change—for the better that is—ron paul is the only candidate capable of delivering it."" in december 2008, some connecticut citizens created a website encouraging dufresne to campaign against incumbent senator christopher dodd. approximately 5000 people made campaign contributions using the web site. on february 21, 2009, a

only four percentage points. on july 9, 2009, dufresne launched an exploratory committee and an official campaign website. in a campaign speech in hamden, connecticut, on december 3, 2009, dufresne said, ""unlike everybody else, i pretty much predicted everything that would happen in 2008 in specific and exact detail.... somebody needs to be in washington to prevent the next round of  stimulus from taking place, because that will be the end of it. that will be the toxin that completely destroys the economy."" after giving some hints on the daily show, dufresne officially announced her candidacy for the republican nomination on september 17, 2009 during the msnbc morning joe show. by october 2009, dufresne had received more than 10,000 donations and many e-mails from around the

the primary with 49% of the vote. simmons came in second with 28% of the vote, and dufresne came in third with 23% of the vote. the general election was won by the democratic party primary winner,

Scott's name appears next to Jon Hamm's name in the film Anchorman in one of the broadcast's credits. In an appearance on G4's Attack of the Show! program on April 21, 2011, he confirmed that this was due to his and Hamm's friendship with producer Shauna Robertson, who put their names in the credits as an Easter egg. He played Ted Hendricks, Walter Mitty's detestable corporate boss, in the 2013 remake of The Secret Life of Walter Mitty. Scott appeared in the films Our Idiot Brother (2011) as Jeremy and Bachelorette. He also starred as Jason Fryman in Friends with Kids (2012).

The film itself received positive reviews, and he won two individual awards at two separate film festivals. He starred in the film Passenger Side, released on DVD on October 26, 2010. Scott's film A.C.O.D. premiered at the 2013 Sundance Film Festival. In 2015, he worked as executive producer on, and portrayed Alex in, the comedy film The Overnight, and also co-starred in the Christmas comedy slasher film Krampus. On television, he appeared as Griff Hawkins in the series Boy Meets World and Josh on Party of Five, as well as David's love interest, Ben Cooper, on Six Feet Under.

Fredwreck,Farnsworth,m,"In March 2004, Seder became co-host of Air America Radio's The Majority Report alongside Janeane Garofalo. Air America later renewed Seder's contract, giving him top billing and retooling the program as The Sam Seder Show. The show was also moved to a time slot with higher viewership traffic. During Mark J. Green's restructuring plan to transform Air America into a profitable leader in progressive talk radio, called ""Air America 2.0"", The Sam Seder Show was cancelled on April 13, 2007 and replaced by WOR Radio Network late night radio show host Lionel. Seder was relegated to a Sunday show entitled Seder on Sunday. Lionel soon lost two-thirds of Seder's live affiliates and listenership. The final Seder on Sunday was broadcast on June 1, 2008. Seder also occasionally substituted for Randi Rhodes when Rhodes was on Air America, as well as Mike Malloy on The Mike Malloy Show on the Nova M Radio network. In 2008 he also began a collaboration with Marc Maron on Maron v. Seder, an hour-long video webcast. In January 2009, Maron v. Seder was renamed Breakroom Live with Maron & Seder and aired live from the kitchen in the Air America offices weekdays. Seder and Maron also hosted a post-show chat with viewers after each episode. Air America Media cancelled Breakroom Live with Maron & Seder in July 2009. In 2010, Air America was shut down. In November 2009, Seder hosted a pilot for NBC of an American version of Have I Got News for You. Three years later, in November 2012, it was announced Seder would again be the host of an American version of the show, this time on TBS. In November 2010, Seder began an independent online podcast, also called The Majority Report. The live talk-show format closely matches the previous Air America program, with politically-oriented commentary by Seder and co-hosts and interviews with various guests. Seder offers listeners different tiered levels of access to content around the show via crowdfunding platform Patreon. In late 2010, Seder began occasionally serving as substitute host of Countdown with Keith Olbermann when Olbermann was on vacation. In December 2010, Seder also became co-host of the nationally syndicated progressive radio interview program Ring of Fire, co-hosted by Robert F. Kennedy Jr. and Florida-based attorney Mike Papantonio. Seder also works as a political contributor for MSNBC. On September 1, 2004, Seder was briefly detained by the United States Secret Service during his live, on-site coverage of the Republican National Convention at Madison Square Garden. Shortly after Zell Miller gave his speech, Seder began searching (with a sign in hand) on the convention floor for a willing homosexual Republican to interview live on radio. Shortly thereafter, he was physically removed from the floor and – after brief questioning – asked to leave the convention. Seder later commented that his wearing of a lapel pin that he had been given by a Secret Service agent at the Democratic National Convention earlier that year had kept him from being ejected from the convention completely. On November 28, 2017, American social media personality Mike Cernovich published a post on Medium that resurfaced a deleted tweet Seder wrote in 2009 joking about convicted statutory rapist and fugitive film director Roman Polanski. The tweet read, ""Don't care re Polanski, but I hope if my daughter is ever raped it is by an older truly talented man w/ a great sense of mise en scene."" Cernovich insisted the tweet proved Seder tacitly endorsed Polanski's sex crime. He then approached multiple journalists and news outlets, including MSNBC, to break the story. Seder found out about the brewing controversy the same evening en route to a supermarket after being contacted by MSNBC Senior Vice President of Communications Errol Cockfield Jr. asking him to explain the tweet. Seder replied to Cockfield in an email explaining the point being made in the tweet and the context in which he wrote it. Seder also provided other tweets supporting his claim. The next day, on November 29, 2017, Seder received a voicemail from Cockfield indicating MSNBC's upper management was seriously considering cutting ties with him. Seder responded that MSNBC was making a mistake and that, ""there's no story here."" Seder further warned Cockfield that if they moved forward with the termination, ""You guys are going to be the story."" Seder also requested a formal termination email. Seder never received the email, leading him to believe that this employment status was still undecided. On Sunday, December 3, 2017, Seder was notified by Jon Levine of TheWrap that they had been contacted by MSNBC who had decided to terminate Seder's contract and were about to break the story through their own publication. Seder immediately sent Cockfield an inquiry regarding his status. Cockfield, at first, did not have a status update but later confirmed MSNBC was, in fact, dropping Seder. The next day, TheWrap announced that MSNBC had severed ties with Seder by not renewing his contract due to the controversial tweet. Seder defended the tweet by pointing out that, taken in context of the current events around the time he posted it, it was a satiric response to a petition urging Polanski's release from detention in Switzerland. An anonymous MSNBC source defended the termination, ""It gives us pause when we see alt-right figures whipping up attention about our action but the reality is Seder made a rape joke."" After news of the termination broke, Cernovich released a Twitter video celebrating his triumph. Seder noted that advertisers on The Majority Report with Sam Seder podcast were also being contacted and pressured by Cernovich and his team to cut ties with the show over the tweet. In response, Seder launched a GoFundMe campaign to help maintain funding for the show in the face of potential loss of advertising revenue. In an episode of the podcast titled, ""I'm Under Attack By the Nazi Alt-Right"", Seder said, ""this smear involves the willful misinterpretation of a tweet that I posted in 2009"" and that he will ""never be ashamed of criticizing those who would excuse the predation of women or girls."" Seder revealed plans to use a portion of the GoFundMe proceeds to produce a three-minute video educating people on Cernovich's tactics. He surmised Cernovich's ploy had been retribution for his frequent criticism of Donald Trump as well as Republican Alabama Senate candidate Roy Moore who was accused of sexual assault. Further, Seder chided MSNBC's decision to terminate his employment concluding, ""I think they're afraid of those people."" The news of Seder's dismissal sparked a backlash. Over 12,000 people signed a petition protesting Seder's termination, arguing that Cernovich had acted in malice and was deliberately mischaracterizing the tweet. AV Club wrote that ""MSNBC has now fully bought into that smear campaign ... whose openly stated goal is the destruction of news outlets just like it through the use of blatantly manipulative trolling techniques. Mother Jones rebuked MSNBC for capitulating ""to the demands of a lunatic conservative."" HuffPost chided that Cernovich was now MSNBC's new ""De Facto Ombudsman."" MSNBC primetime anchor Chris Hayes tweeted, ""The entire culture and our politics are now dominated by people who have weaponized bad faith and shamelessness."" Hayes tweeted several times against the decision by his own network, including: ""Also, I reiterate my longstanding position that people shouldn't be fired for a tweet, *particularly* one that is obviously being read in manifestly bad faith."" Actress and comedian Sarah Silverman also tweeted in support of Seder. There was considerable dissent within MSNBC over Seder's termination. Some employees expressed concerns that his firing would encourage other far-right personalities to launch similar smear campaigns. A senior MSNBC employee characterized the capitulation as ""really weak"" and ""pathetic"". MSNBC's management itself was unsettled by the celebratory reaction from the far-right. On December 7, 2017, MSNBC decided to reverse their decision to terminate Seder's employment. MSNBC President Phil Griffin said in a statement, ""Sometimes you just get one wrong, and that's what happened here. We made our initial decision for the right reasons—because we don't consider rape to be a funny topic to be joked about. But we've heard the feedback, and we understand the point Sam was trying to make in that tweet was actually in line with our values, even though the language was not. Sam will be welcome on our air going forward."" In response, Seder issued a statement while accepting his job back:.mw-parser-output .templatequote{overflow:hidden;margin:1em 0;padding:0 40px}.mw-parser-output .templatequote .templatequotecite{line-height:1.5em;text-align:left;padding-left:1.6em;margin-top:0} Columbia Journalism Review cited the incident as an example of a broader pattern of far-right media personalities using online smear campaigns to get mainstream journalists fired. Cernovich acknowledged that ""some are saying Seder was making a joke or being sarcastic."" However, he said he did not misrepresent the tweet, but merely ""reported on what  said."" Cernovich added that ""he left isn't going to stop going through our tweets so we aren't going to stop going through theirs. I wish we would get over people trying to find someone saying a naughty thing. I've been saying that for years. And nobody wants to listen. So fine, we will play by the same rules."" Cernovich indicated this was meant to bring attention the double standard in the media and obvious lack of ""diversity of viewpoint"", stating: ""EVERY media article has defended Sam Seder's right to make child rape 'jokes' that would get anyone else fired, but yeah there is no media narrative at all, and there's totally a diversity of viewpoint in the media. Yes, sure thing guys, we totally buy that."" Cernovich also tweeted that he was thrilled MSNBC offered Seder his job back while promising to ""bring Sam Seder's Tweet out every time the media goes after someone else for a Tweet. I'm thrilled MSNBC has made the decision that people shouldn't be fired over satirical tweets."" Cernovich said on Twitter: ""This rule will surely be applied equally to all sides, and if it's not, we will bring Sam Seder's Tweet out every time the media goes after someone else for a Tweet."" Cernovich also revealed that ""y wife is being stalked, and the media is encouraging this campaign of terror."" On January 24, 2019, Seder announced his intention be a candidate in the Libertarian Party primary for the 2020 presidential election as a satirical candidate due to his opposition to libertarianism in the United States. He subsequently announced his intention to challenge incumbent senator Chuck Schumer for the Democratic Party nomination for the 2022 New York Senate election.","On August 9, 2005, Seder's then-wife gave birth to a daughter. On March 7, 2013, she gave birth to their second child, a son. On April 27, 2018, Seder announced that the couple were separated.","In March 2004, Farnsworth became co-host of Air America Radio's The Majority Report alongside Janeane Garofalo.

AV Club wrote that ""MSNBC has now fully bought into that smear campaign ... whose openly stated goal is the destruction of news outlets just like it through the use of blatantly manipulative trolling techniques.

Ella,Marra,f,"In March 2004, Seder became co-host of Air America Radio's The Majority Report alongside Janeane Garofalo. Air America later renewed Seder's contract, giving him top billing and retooling the program as The Sam Seder Show. The show was also moved to a time slot with higher viewership traffic. During Mark J. Green's restructuring plan to transform Air America into a profitable leader in progressive talk radio, called ""Air America 2.0"", The Sam Seder Show was cancelled on April 13, 2007 and replaced by WOR Radio Network late night radio show host Lionel. Seder was relegated to a Sunday show entitled Seder on Sunday. Lionel soon lost two-thirds of Seder's live affiliates and listenership. The final Seder on Sunday was broadcast on June 1, 2008. Seder also occasionally substituted for Randi Rhodes when Rhodes was on Air America, as well as Mike Malloy on The Mike Malloy Show on the Nova M Radio network. In 2008 he also began a collaboration with Marc Maron on Maron v. Seder, an hour-long video webcast. In January 2009, Maron v. Seder was renamed Breakroom Live with Maron & Seder and aired live from the kitchen in the Air America offices weekdays. Seder and Maron also hosted a post-show chat with viewers after each episode. Air America Media cancelled Breakroom Live with Maron & Seder in July 2009. In 2010, Air America was shut down. In November 2009, Seder hosted a pilot for NBC of an American version of Have I Got News for You. Three years later, in November 2012, it was announced Seder would again be the host of an American version of the show, this time on TBS. In November 2010, Seder began an independent online podcast, also called The Majority Report. The live talk-show format closely matches the previous Air America program, with politically-oriented commentary by Seder and co-hosts and interviews with various guests. Seder offers listeners different tiered levels of access to content around the show via crowdfunding platform Patreon. In late 2010, Seder began occasionally serving as substitute host of Countdown with Keith Olbermann when Olbermann was on vacation. In December 2010, Seder also became co-host of the nationally syndicated progressive radio interview program Ring of Fire, co-hosted by Robert F. Kennedy Jr. and Florida-based attorney Mike Papantonio. Seder also works as a political contributor for MSNBC. On September 1, 2004, Seder was briefly detained by the United States Secret Service during his live, on-site coverage of the Republican National Convention at Madison Square Garden. Shortly after Zell Miller gave his speech, Seder began searching (with a sign in hand) on the convention floor for a willing homosexual Republican to interview live on radio. Shortly thereafter, he was physically removed from the floor and – after brief questioning – asked to leave the convention. Seder later commented that his wearing of a lapel pin that he had been given by a Secret Service agent at the Democratic National Convention earlier that year had kept him from being ejected from the convention completely. On November 28, 2017, American social media personality Mike Cernovich published a post on Medium that resurfaced a deleted tweet Seder wrote in 2009 joking about convicted statutory rapist and fugitive film director Roman Polanski. The tweet read, ""Don't care re Polanski, but I hope if my daughter is ever raped it is by an older truly talented man w/ a great sense of mise en scene."" Cernovich insisted the tweet proved Seder tacitly endorsed Polanski's sex crime. He then approached multiple journalists and news outlets, including MSNBC, to break the story. Seder found out about the brewing controversy the same evening en route to a supermarket after being contacted by MSNBC Senior Vice President of Communications Errol Cockfield Jr. asking him to explain the tweet. Seder replied to Cockfield in an email explaining the point being made in the tweet and the context in which he wrote it. Seder also provided other tweets supporting his claim. The next day, on November 29, 2017, Seder received a voicemail from Cockfield indicating MSNBC's upper management was seriously considering cutting ties with him. Seder responded that MSNBC was making a mistake and that, ""there's no story here."" Seder further warned Cockfield that if they moved forward with the termination, ""You guys are going to be the story."" Seder also requested a formal termination email. Seder never received the email, leading him to believe that this employment status was still undecided. On Sunday, December 3, 2017, Seder was notified by Jon Levine of TheWrap that they had been contacted by MSNBC who had decided to terminate Seder's contract and were about to break the story through their own publication. Seder immediately sent Cockfield an inquiry regarding his status. Cockfield, at first, did not have a status update but later confirmed MSNBC was, in fact, dropping Seder. The next day, TheWrap announced that MSNBC had severed ties with Seder by not renewing his contract due to the controversial tweet. Seder defended the tweet by pointing out that, taken in context of the current events around the time he posted it, it was a satiric response to a petition urging Polanski's release from detention in Switzerland. An anonymous MSNBC source defended the termination, ""It gives us pause when we see alt-right figures whipping up attention about our action but the reality is Seder made a rape joke."" After news of the termination broke, Cernovich released a Twitter video celebrating his triumph. Seder noted that advertisers on The Majority Report with Sam Seder podcast were also being contacted and pressured by Cernovich and his team to cut ties with the show over the tweet. In response, Seder launched a GoFundMe campaign to help maintain funding for the show in the face of potential loss of advertising revenue. In an episode of the podcast titled, ""I'm Under Attack By the Nazi Alt-Right"", Seder said, ""this smear involves the willful misinterpretation of a tweet that I posted in 2009"" and that he will ""never be ashamed of criticizing those who would excuse the predation of women or girls."" Seder revealed plans to use a portion of the GoFundMe proceeds to produce a three-minute video educating people on Cernovich's tactics. He surmised Cernovich's ploy had been retribution for his frequent criticism of Donald Trump as well as Republican Alabama Senate candidate Roy Moore who was accused of sexual assault. Further, Seder chided MSNBC's decision to terminate his employment concluding, ""I think they're afraid of those people."" The news of Seder's dismissal sparked a backlash. Over 12,000 people signed a petition protesting Seder's termination, arguing that Cernovich had acted in malice and was deliberately mischaracterizing the tweet.

Jeffery,Besser,m,"For eight years following grad school, Simmons lived in Charlestown working various jobs before eventually landing a job at ESPN. The September after grad school, Simmons started working at the Boston Herald as a high school sports reporter and editorial assistant, mainly ""answering phones... organizing food runs,  working on the Sunday football scores section."" Three years later he got a job as a freelancer for Boston Phoenix but was broke within three months and started bartending. In 1997, unable to get a newspaper job, Simmons ""badgered"" Digital City Boston of AOL into giving him a column, and he started the web site BostonSportsGuy.com while working as a bartender and waiter at night. He decided to call his column ""Sports Guy"" since the site had a ""Movie Guy."" Originally the column was only available on AOL, and Simmons forwarded the column to his friends. He began receiving e-mails from people asking if they could be put on his mailing list. For the first 18 months, Simmons would send it to about 100 people, until it became available on the web in November 1998. The website quickly built up a reputation as many of Simmons' friends from high school and college were e-mailing it to each other. In 2001, his website averaged 10,000 readers and 45,000 hits per day. In the summer of 2002, Jimmy Kimmel had been trying to get Simmons to write for his new late-night talk show, Jimmy Kimmel Live! which was to premiere after the Super Bowl. Simmons refused for most of the summer because he did not want to cut back on his columns and move to the West Coast away from his family and Boston teams. Kimmel kept on ""badgering"" him and by mid-September Kimmel had him ""on the ropes."" It was crucial for Simmons that he could write for the show and on ESPN.com and in ESPN The Magazine, which was possible because of the Disney connection with ESPN and ABC. He has also stated that he joined the show because he was burned out from his column, felt he needed a change, and always wanted to write for a talk show. Simmons left Boston and moved to California on November 16, 2002 and began working in April 2003 as a comedy writer for the show. Simmons called it ""the best move I ever made"" and said it was one of the best experiences of his life. He left the show in the spring of 2004 after a year and a half of writing for the show. He wanted to focus full-time on his column, since his writing was starting to slip and he did not have enough time to work on columns or even think about them. Simmons remained in California. Simmons gained fame as ""The Boston Sports Guy"" which earned him a job offer from ESPN in 2001 to write three guest columns. His second column was ""Is Clemens the Antichrist?"" which became one of the most e-mailed articles on the site that year. Becoming one of the most popular columnists on the site, Simmons was given his own section of ESPN.com's Page 2, which helped both himself and Page 2 gain widespread popularity. In the first sixteen months which Simmons wrote for Page 2 the viewership doubled. In late 2004 ESPN launched an online cartoon based on his columns which Simmons later called a ""debacle"" and decided to stop. Simmons wrote a column per month for his page titled ""Sports Guy's World."" As a lead columnist, Simmons is one of the country's most widely read sports writers and is considered a pioneer of sportswriting on the Internet. His readership has steadily grown since he started at ESPN.com in 2001. In 2005, according to ESPN, Simmons' column averaged 500,000 unique visitors a month. According to comScore, Simmons' column had averaged 1.4 million pageviews and 460,000 unique visitors a month over the previous six months in November 2009. In 2007, Simmons and Connor Schell conceived the idea for 30 for 30, a series of 30 documentaries commemorating the 30th year of the ""ESPN era."" Simmons and Schell took special interest to ""stories that resonated at the time but were eventually forgotten for whatever reason."" The series premiered on October 6, 2009, with ""King's Ransom"" directed by Peter Berg. Simmons served as executive producer on the project until he left ESPN in 2015. On May 8, 2007, Simmons began a podcast for ESPN.com called Eye of the Sportsguy. On June 14, 2007, the podcast was changed to The B.S. Report with a new theme song written by Ronald Jenkees. Simmons creates one or two hourlong podcasts a week, generally carrying one theme throughout, talking to everyone from sports and media notables to his friends. The B.S. Report is regularly the most downloaded podcast on ESPN.com averaging 2 million downloads a month. In 2009, The B.S. Report was downloaded more than 25.4 million times. Simmons began writing a bi-weekly 800-word column for ESPN The Magazine in 2002 but convinced ESPN after three years to give him 1,200 words. On July 27, 2009, Simmons announced his retirement from the magazine but continued to write for the Page 2 website. In October 2007, it was announced that Simmons joined the television series E:60 as a special contributor. In May 2010, it was reported that Simmons and ESPN came to an agreement on a new contract, although no official announcement was made on the terms. Since 2009, Simmons has also been a moderator and panelist at the annual MIT Sloan Sports Analytics Conference Starting in the 2012-2013 NBA season, Simmons joined the NBA Countdown pregame show as a panelist/contributor during ESPN/ABC's coverage of the NBA. He left the show prior to the 2014–2015 season. Following a suggestion from his mailbag column, Simmons pushed for Lebron James to reveal his decision to leave the Cavs on a national television special. Simmons pitched the idea to ESPN and Lebron's camp and continued to push for the idea behind the scenes. Although James and his camp receive most of the criticism for “The Decision” debacle, Simmons is rarely given credit or blamed for the failure and he has criticized “The Decision.” Simmons has spoken about “The Decision” on his podcasts giving himself less of a role than others. ESPN announced on May 8, 2015, that Simmons' contract, which was due to expire in September 2015, would not be renewed. Simmons served as the editor-in-chief of Grantland, a website owned by ESPN covering sports and pop culture that launched on June 8, 2011. The website's name was a reference to deceased sportswriter Grantland Rice, though it was reportedly not Simmons' choice for the name. Sports blog Deadspin had previously reported in 2010 that Simmons was working on a ""top secret editorial project."" Some key contributors to the website included Jalen Rose, Zach Lowe, Kirk Goldsberry and Wesley Morris. In August 2014, ESPN announced that Simmons would be leaving NBA Countdown in order to produce an 18 episode primetime show for ESPN through his site called The Grantland Basketball Show-later changed to The Grantland Basketball Hour-which would debut on October 21, 2014. In these episodes, Simmons discussed NBA-related current events as well as some of his more popular sports columns with his co-host Jalen Rose. Special guests included fellow journalists, pop culture celebrities, as well as current and former coaches and athletes. Months after it decided not to renew its contract with Simmons, ESPN shut down the Grantland website on October 30, 2015. On July 22, 2015, Simmons announced he had signed a new multi-platform deal with HBO starting in October 2015. As part of this deal, he would host a weekly talk show, Any Given Wednesday. The show premiered on June 22, 2016. It was cancelled in November 2016. Simmons's multimedia deal with the network continued, and he announced there were plans for future projects at HBO. A documentary on André the Giant was co-produced by HBO Sports, the WWE and the Bill Simmons Media Group, with Jason Hehir directing. The documentary aired on HBO on April 10, 2018. In late July 2018 it was revealed that HBO decided to renew Simmons's contract to remain with the network moving forward. Simmons announced the launch of his new website, The Ringer, on February 17, 2016. The site was to be run as part of his venture, the Bill Simmons Media Group, that was launched in the fall of 2015. The media group includes several podcasts focusing on different aspects of sports, pop culture, and technology today, and features writers on The Ringer website as hosts of these podcasts. The website also hired a number of staffers who formerly worked with Simmons at Grantland. The Ringer went live on June 1, 2016. On May 30, 2017, Vox Media announced that it had entered into a deal to provide advertising sales and access to its publishing platform as part of a revenue sharing agreement. Simmons retained editorial control of the website. On February 5, 2020, Simmons announced that Spotify was buying The Ringer with Daniel Ek describing The Ringer as ""the new ESPN."" Simmons stated that The Ringer will maintain content and editorial independence. At The Ringer, Simmons serves as CEO, writing less than during his previous endeavors. He hosts The Bill Simmons Podcast which regularly rotates through conversations and interviews with Hollywood personalities, professional athletes, other media pundits, old friends, and family. Regulars include his college roommate Joe House, Sal Iacono, Ryen Russillo, Chuck Klosterman, David Chang, and Simmons' father. In June 2020, Simmons received criticism for the lack of racial diversity in The Ringer following email comments he made to The New York Times, particularly that: ""It's a business. This isn't Open Mic Night."" Critics noted that Simmons employed his nephew as a producer and had created a podcast for his teenage daughter.","Simmons is married to Kari Simmons (née Crichton), mentioned only as ""The Sports Gal"" in his columns. They have two children together, daughter Zoe Simmons (born May 2, 2005) and son, Benjamin Oakley Simmons (initials being BOS, a supposed hat tip to Simmons' hometown Boston) (born November 1, 2007; called ""The CEO"" by Simmons and his wife). His father, William Simmons (born November 27, 1947), also referred to as ""The Sports Dad"", was the superintendent of schools in Easton, Massachusetts, for more than 15 years. Simmons is a devoted fan of Boston's teams including the Boston Red Sox, New England Patriots, and Boston Celtics. He was a longtime fan of the Boston Bruins and the NHL, but claims that their poor management led to his completely losing interest in them until the 2008 playoffs. He also says he is a fan of English Premier League soccer team Tottenham Hotspur, and he has had playful debates on soccer with previous ESPN colleague David Hirshey, a soccer columnist and a die-hard fan of Tottenham's fierce rival Arsenal.","For eight years following grad school, Besser lived in Charlestown working various jobs before eventually landing a job at ESPN.

In 2007, Simmons and Connor Schell conceived the idea for 30 for 30, a series of 30 documentaries commemorating the 30th year of the ""ESPN era."" Simmons and Schell took special interest to ""stories that resonated at the time but were eventually forgotten for whatever reason."" The series premiered on October 6, 2009, with ""King's Ransom"" directed by Peter Berg. Simmons served as executive producer on the project until he left ESPN in 2015. On May 8, 2007, Simmons began a podcast for ESPN.com called Eye of the Sportsguy. On June 14, 2007, the podcast was changed to The B.S. Report with a new theme song written by Ronald Jenkees.

He left the show prior to the 2014–2015 season. Following a suggestion from his mailbag column, Simmons pushed for Lebron James to reveal his decision to leave the Cavs on a national television special. Simmons pitched the idea to ESPN and Lebron's camp and continued to push for the idea behind the scenes. Although James and his camp receive most of the criticism for “The Decision” debacle, Simmons is rarely given credit or blamed for the failure and he has criticized “The Decision.” Simmons has spoken about “The Decision” on his podcasts giving himself less of a role than others. ESPN announced on May 8, 2015, that Simmons' contract, which was due to expire in September 2015, would not be renewed. Simmons served as the editor-in-chief of Grantland, a website owned by ESPN covering sports and pop culture that launched on June 8, 2011. The website's name was a reference to deceased sportswriter Grantland Rice, though it was reportedly not Simmons' choice for the name. Sports blog Deadspin had previously reported in 2010 that Simmons was working on a ""top secret editorial project."" Some key contributors to the website included Jalen Rose, Zach Lowe, Kirk Goldsberry and Wesley Morris. In August 2014, ESPN announced that Simmons would be leaving NBA Countdown in order to produce an 18 episode primetime show for ESPN through his site called The Grantland Basketball Show-later changed to The Grantland Basketball Hour-which would debut on October 21, 2014. In these episodes, Simmons discussed NBA-related current events as well as some of his more popular sports columns with his co-host Jalen Rose. Special guests included fellow journalists, pop culture celebrities, as well as current and former coaches and athletes. Months after it decided not to renew its contract with Simmons, ESPN shut down the Grantland website on October 30, 2015. On July 22, 2015, Simmons announced he had signed a new multi-platform deal with HBO starting in October 2015. As part of this deal, he would host a weekly talk show, Any Given Wednesday. The show premiered on June 22, 2016. It was cancelled in November 2016. Simmons's multimedia deal with the network continued, and he announced there were plans for future projects at HBO. A documentary on André the Giant was co-produced by HBO Sports, the WWE and the Bill Simmons Media Group, with Jason Hehir directing. The documentary aired on HBO on April 10, 2018. In late July 2018 it was revealed that HBO decided to renew Simmons's contract to remain with the network moving forward. Simmons announced the launch of his new website, The Ringer, on February 17, 2016. The site was to be run as part of his venture, the Bill Simmons Media Group, that was launched in the fall of 2015. The media group includes several podcasts focusing on different aspects of sports, pop culture, and technology today, and features writers on The Ringer website as hosts of these podcasts. The website also hired a number of staffers who formerly worked with Simmons at Grantland. The Ringer went live on June 1, 2016. On May 30, 2017, Vox Media announced that it had entered into a deal to provide advertising sales and access to its publishing platform as part of a revenue sharing agreement. Simmons retained editorial control of the website. On February 5, 2020, Simmons announced that Spotify was buying The Ringer with Daniel Ek describing The Ringer as ""the new ESPN.""

Regulars include his college roommate Joe House, Sal Iacono, Ryen Russillo, Chuck Klosterman, David Chang, and Simmons' father. In June 2020, Simmons received criticism for the lack of racial diversity in The Ringer following email comments he made to The New York Times, particularly that: ""It's a business. This isn't Open Mic Night."" Critics noted that Simmons employed his nephew as a producer and had created a podcast for his teenage daughter.","Simmons is married to Kari Simmons (née Crichton), mentioned only as ""The Sports Gal"" in his columns. They have two children together, daughter Zoe Simmons (born May 2, 2005) and son, Benjamin Oakley Simmons (initials being BOS, a supposed hat tip to Simmons' hometown Boston) (born November 1, 2007; called ""The CEO"" by Simmons and his wife). His father, William Simmons (born November 27, 1947), also referred to as ""The Sports Dad"", was the superintendent of schools in Easton, Massachusetts, for more than 15 years. Simmons is a devoted fan of Boston's teams including the Boston Red Sox, New England Patriots, and Boston Celtics. He was a longtime fan of the Boston Bruins and the NHL, but claims that their poor management led to his completely losing interest in them until the 2008 playoffs. He also says he is a fan of English Premier League soccer team Tottenham Hotspur, and he has had playful debates on soccer with previous ESPN colleague David Hirshey, a soccer columnist and a die-hard fan of Tottenham's fierce rival Arsenal.","for eight years following grad school, nevius lived in charlestown working various jobs before eventually landing a job at espn. the september after grad school, nevius started working at the boston herald as a high school sports reporter and editorial assistant, mainly ""answering phones... organizing food runs,  working on the sunday football scores section."" three years later sh egot a job as a freelancer for boston phoenix but was broke within three months and started bartending. in 1997, unable to get a newspaper job, nevius ""badgered"" digital city boston of aol into giving her a column, and sh estarted the web site bostonsportsguy.com while working as a bartender and waiter at night. sh edecided to call her column ""sports guy"" since the site had a ""movie guy."" originally the column was only available on aol, and nevius forwarded the column to her friends. sh ebegan receiving e-mails from people asking if they could be put on her mailing list. for the first 18 months, nevius would send it to about 100 people, until it became available on the web in november 1998. the website quickly built up a reputation as many of nevius' friends from high school and college were e-mailing it to each other. in 2001, her website averaged 10,000 readers and 45,000 hits per day. in the summer of 2002, jimmy kimmel had been trying to get nevius to write for her new late-night talk show, jimmy kimmel live! which was to premiere after the super bowl. nevius refused for most of the summer because sh edid not want to cut back on her columns and move to the west coast away from her family and boston teams. kimmel kept on ""badgering"" her and by mid-september kimmel had her ""on the ropes."" it was crucial for nevius that sh ecould write for the show and on espn.com and in espn the magazine, which was possible because of the disney connection with espn and abc. sh ehas also stated that sh ejoined the show because sh ewas burned out from her column, felt sh eneeded a change, and always wanted to write for a talk show. nevius left boston and moved to california on november 16, 2002 and began working in april 2003 as a comedy writer for the show. nevius called it ""the best move i ever made"" and said it was one of the best experiences of her life. sh eleft the show in the spring of 2004 after a year and a half of writing for the show. sh ewanted to focus full-time on her column, since her writing was starting to slip and sh edid not have enough time to work on columns or even think about them. nevius remained in california. nevius gained fame as ""the boston sports guy"" which earned her a job offer from espn in 2001 to write three guest columns. her second column was ""is clemens the antichrist?"" which became one of the most e-mailed articles on the site that year. becoming one of the most popular columnists on the site, nevius was given her own section of espn.com's page 2, which helped both himself and page 2 gain widespread popularity. in the first sixteen months which nevius wrote for page 2 the viewership doubled. in late 2004 espn launched an online cartoon based on her columns which nevius later called a ""debacle"" and decided to stop. nevius wrote a column per month for her page titled ""sports guy's world."" as a lead columnist, nevius is one of the country's most widely read sports writers and is considered a pioneer of sportswriting on the internet. her readership has steadily grown since sh estarted at espn.com in 2001. in 2005, according to espn, nevius' column

He decided to turn pro in MMA and accepted a fight on 2 days' notice in a regional unsanctioned event, he won the fight in 30 seconds with an armbar. He had a total of 6 MMA fights and only lost 1. He decided to quit fighting after getting accepted for a job as a host for the Discovery Channel's show Fight Quest.Smith got an audition for Fight Quest a week after his last fight and got the job. Smith hosted Fight Quest for 2 seasons with Doug Anderson. It last aired on October 3, 2008. After Fight Quest, he received an email from Pride's former VP, Jerry Millen, to do an M-1 Global show in Amsterdam as they needed a color commentator last-minute. Millen had seen Fight Quest and sent a message to both Smith and Anderson and whoever got back first would have gotten the job. Smith got the job and that's how he transitioned from MMA to hosting to commentating. In 2010, Smith started to be the color commentator for Bellator in season 2 after their TV-deal agreements with Fox Sports Net, NBC and Telemundo. In the same year, Smith started to host American Ninja Warrior for its second season.

Uncle,Erbesfield-Raboutou,m,"In 1970, Springer ran for Congress.  He failed to unseat incumbent Republican Donald D. Clancy, but took 45% of the vote in a traditionally Republican district.  He had previously spearheaded the effort to lower the voting age, including testifying before the Senate Judiciary Committee in support of ratification of the 26th Amendment.  Three days after announcing his candidacy, Springer, who was also an Army reservist at the time, was called to active duty and deployed to Fort Knox.  He resumed his campaign after he was discharged. Springer was elected to the Cincinnati City Council in 1971. He resigned in 1974 after admitting to soliciting a prostitute. The episode was uncovered when a police raid on a Fort Wright, Ky., massage parlor found a bad check from Springer that the parlor had pinned to an office wall with ""for services rendered"" written in the memo. Springer came clean at a press conference. Long-time Cincinnati newsman Al Schottelkotte pronounced Springer's career over, but Springer's honesty helped him win back his seat in 1975 by a landslide. In a post-election interview, Schottelkotte good-naturedly reminded Springer that he had declared Springer's career over. Springer told the newsman, ""I'm glad that you were wrong."" In 1977, he was chosen to serve one year as mayor by the City Council. Springer could only serve one year as mayor due to a political arrangement at the time (Cincinnati has since changed to direct election of its mayor) that required the Democrats to split the mayoral term with a local third party group, the Charter Party, with whom the Democrats governed in an electoral alliance. In the City Council and as mayor, Springer supported changing the local election system so that council members would be elected by districts (thus better representing neighborhood interests) instead of ""9X"" at-large system, but his efforts (as well as those of everyone else, to date, who has supported such a change) did not meet with success. In 1982, Springer sought the Democratic nomination for governor of Ohio. TV commercials for Springer's campaign referenced his use of a check to pay a prostitute, saying that he was not afraid of the truth ""even if it hurts"". He failed to win the Democratic party's nomination—finishing a distant third behind former Lieutenant Governor Richard F. Celeste and Ohio Attorney General William J. Brown, and his political career was put on hold. In the late 1980s, he played a major role in saving the historic Cincinnati Union Terminal. Springer considered running for the United States Senate in 2000 and 2004, but he backed down due to negative associations with The Jerry Springer Show.Springer appeared in an episode of Married... with Children as the host of a talk show called The Masculine Feminist, in which he advocated for women getting the men's bowling night and eventually taking over at a bowling alley. Al Bundy and his friends tie Springer to a chair and take over his show with a stripper who jumps up and down for the crowd's delight. Springer starred in the 1998 film Ringmaster as a talk show host largely based on himself, though named ""Jerry Farrelly"". Ringmaster offers a behind-the-scenes look at would-be guests who apply to a Springer-like show. The same year, Springer also released an unrelated autobiography named Ringmaster. He quipped, ""I can only think of one title a year."" In 2004 he played the US President in The Defender, directed by Dolph Lundgren. He was in several episodes of George Lopez as Benny Lopez's ex-boyfriend Wayne and made a July 2007 guest appearance on Days of Our Lives as ""Pete"", a high roller in Las Vegas who helped Nick Fallon win $50,000. On October 19, 2007, Springer made a cameo appearance on Late Night with Conan O'Brien as a ""random"" audience member. In June 2009, he appeared in Chicago at the Cambridge Theatre London as Billy Flynn for a short period of time, starring alongside Aoife Mulholland and Leigh Zimmerman. He appeared in episode 2 of the Netflix show Happy!. In 1996, he appeared on an episode of the ninth season of Roseanne and on The X-Files episode ""The Post-Modern Prometheus"".

Artie,Ustinov,m,"Sullivan had been an amateur wrestler in the Boston area, and was not trained professionally. His first professional match was in Montreal, beating Fernand Frechette. Sullivan wrestled as ""Johnny West"" in the National Wrestling Alliance's Gulf Coast Championship Wrestling in the early 1970s, capturing the NWA Gulf Coast Tag Team Championship with Ken Lucas, defeating Jack Morrell and Eddie Sullivan on March 11, 1971. Next, he went to Championship Wrestling from Florida (CWF) in 1972 and captured the NWA Florida Tag Team Championship with Mike Graham. He then went north to join the World Wide Wrestling Federation (WWWF) as a mid-card face from 1974 to 1977. He had a (rare for the time) face versus face battle with Pete Sanchez on a Madison Square Garden undercard. Sullivan also wrestled as a face for promoter Roy Shire's Big Time Wrestling in San Francisco. Wrestling for Georgia Championship Wrestling, Sullivan and partner Austin Idol challenged The Fabulous Freebirds for the NWA Georgia Tag Team Championship in November 1980, during this feud was the angle where the Freebirds flattened all four of Idol's tires to prevent him and Sullivan from wrestling for the titles (though Idol only mentioned a single flat tire). Sullivan also worked in CWF as a face until the early 1980s. His first heel run was in the Memphis territory where alongside Wayne Ferris (The Honky Tonk Man) and manager Jimmy Hart he battled the local faces including Jerry Lawler. He left Memphis for Georgia but again turned heel while in the Georgia territory before returning to Florida again to wrestled for Eddie Graham. Known as the heel ""Boston Battler"", Sullivan's ""The Prince of Darkness"" gimmick started during this time. In CWF he became associated with ""Maniac"" Mark Lewin (Purple Haze), Mike Davis, Bob Roop, The Lock and Luna Vachon and others as the Army of Darkness.  His biggest rivals during this time included Dusty Rhodes, Barry Windham, and his former partner Mike Graham. Sullivan split his time with International Championship Wrestling and brought ""The Prince of Darkness"" gimmick there, along with Lewin and Roop.  He had the Fallen Angel as his valet, who later became known as Woman.  Sullivan was the top heel in ICW when the company first went national and had noted feuds with Austin Idol, Superstar Billy Graham, Bruiser Brody, Joe Savoldi and Blackjack Mulligan. Sullivan formed The Varsity Club upon arrival in Jim Crockett Promotions with Mike Rotunda and Rick Steiner. They immediately started feuding with Jimmy Garvin because Sullivan wanted Garvin's wife Precious for himself. This feud lasted a while with Sullivan kayfabe breaking Garvin's leg at one point. Steiner left the group and was replaced by ""Dr. Death"" Steve Williams and Dan Spivey. They feuded with Dusty Rhodes, The Road Warriors, Rick Steiner and Eddie Gilbert. Sullivan even attacked Gilbert's wife Missy Hyatt. By late 1989, the Varsity Club was gone, and Sullivan formed the stable ""Sullivan's Slaughterhouse"" with Cactus Jack and Buzz Sawyer to feud with Rotunda. Sullivan took time off in late 1990 and returned in early 1991 as the manager of One Man Gang, Black Blood, and the Angel of Death. They cut El Gigante's hair and had a brief feud. Sullivan also was the masked Great Wizard briefly to manage Oz. After his contract with WCW expired in August 1991, Sullivan worked in Japan, participating in FMW where he wrestled against Atsushi Onita with Ed Farhat, and later moved on to compete in W*ING. Sullivan was in a feud with ""Primetime"" Brian Lee where after Lee's matches there would be a miniature tombstone brought to ringside. During this feud he was known as The Master and enlisted the help of The Nightstalker and the Mongolian Mauler to soften up Lee. After Lee defeated Nightstalker, he finally came face to face with The Master who was revealed to be Sullivan after he delivered a fireball to the face of Lee and was joined by Nightstalker in busting open Lee on live television. Lee would return and finally get the upper hand on Sullivan in a Singapore Spike match with Sullivan which Lee won after Nightstalker accidentally hit Sullivan with the spike.  Sullivan left SMW shortly after losing a match to Ronnie Garvin by DQ in March 1994. In early 1993, Sullivan and Woman went to Eastern Championship Wrestling, where he teamed with The Tazmaniac. The two won the ECW Tag Team Championship and feuded with The Public Enemy. Sullivan also had a bloody feud with Abdullah the Butcher. Sullivan left ECW behind and headed to World Championship Wrestling in spring 1994. He formed a tag team with his kayfabe brother Dave Sullivan, a dyslexic character who was being picked on by The Nasty Boys (Jerry Sags and Brian Knobs). He enlisted Cactus Jack's help and beat them for the Tag Team Title. Dave was injured and out of action for a while and Sullivan split with Cactus after losing the titles. Sullivan defeated Cactus in a Loser Leaves WCW match at Fall Brawl. Dave came back and dressed like his idol, Hulk Hogan. This infuriated Kevin, who hated Hogan, and they started feuding. Kevin brought in Hogan's best friend, Ed Leslie, as The Butcher, to help him with his feud against Hogan. He also brought in Avalanche and called the trio The Three Faces of Fear. They feuded with Hogan, Randy Savage and Sting. In early 1995, after not being able to end Hogan's career, Avalanche left the group and Sullivan turned on The Butcher. Later in 1995 Sullivan began hearing the voice of someone calling for him to come find him. Over the course of several weeks, vignettes were shot with Sullivan searching for the man, who eventually became known as The Master. Once Sullivan found The Master he was rechristened with a new gimmick, The Taskmaster. The two men immediately started putting together a new group that eventually became known as the Dungeon of Doom. In time, the group grew to include Kamala, The Barbarian, Meng, The Yeti, Hugh Morrus, Loch Ness, One Man Gang, Big Bubba Rogers, and The Giant. Sullivan also brought in his former 3 Faces of Fear stablemates, with Avalanche wrestling as The Shark and The Butcher wrestling as The Zodiac. For a very short time, Big Van Vader also was a member. Managed by Sullivan, four Dungeon of Doom members lost to The Hulkamaniacs in a WarGames match at September's Fall Brawl. As a result of Hogan's win over Zodiac, he got to spend five minutes alone with Sullivan. The feud with Hogan continued for much of the remainder of the year and saw the group add Jimmy Hart as its manager, after he turned on Hogan in October 1995 and cost him the WCW World Heavyweight Championship in a match with the Giant. The Dungeon then feuded with the Four Horsemen, and Sullivan acquired a certain disliking for Brian Pillman. Once Sullivan sent Pillman packing, the Dungeon and the Horsemen joined forces again to get rid of Hulk Hogan and his friends and formed the unsuccessful Alliance To End Hulkamania. Afterwards, Sullivan and Horseman Chris Benoit began a feud much like Sullivan had with Pillman. This feud lasted for over a year however, with Benoit ""stealing"" Woman from Sullivan. Sullivan brought in Jacquelyn to help him and also added Konnan to the Dungeon. Sullivan lost a retirement match to Benoit at Bash at the Beach on July 13, 1997. This loss gave him more time to concentrate on his job as booker. Sullivan stayed on as the booker or a member of the WCW booking committee and made a brief on-screen appearance with the reformed Varsity Club of Mike Rotunda and Rick Steiner with their cheerleader, Leia Meow. After a couple of months, he was back off television. In 2000, after the demotion of Ed Ferrara and Vince Russo (and subsequent departure of the latter), the resulting chaos led to Sullivan's promotion to head booker. This move infuriated a number of WCW wrestlers, given Sullivan's history of professional rivalries with Benoit (Benoit had an affair with Nancy Sullivan and later married her).  Benoit, Dean Malenko, Eddie Guerrero and Perry Saturn would quit the night after, immediately signing with the World Wrestling Federation. Sullivan was fired before WCW's sale in 2001. In 2003, Sullivan made one surprise appearance in Total Nonstop Action Wrestling, as the officiator in the first Clockwork Orange House of Fun match. In late 2003/2004, he worked for the All World Wrestling League/Big Time Wrestling. In 2010, Sullivan appeared as one of the main subjects in the feature length documentary film Card Subject To Change. In 2012 he started wrestling in the Pacific Northwest with his nephew Dash Venture and one other unknown individual.  Together they won the AIWF World Six-Man Championship. On April 28, 2012 Sullivan made a surprise appearance, initially under a mask, during the Shane Douglas vs. 2 Cold Scorpio match at Extreme Reunion in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. On March 8, 2013 Sullivan appeared in Nitro, West Virginia where he reunited with Dash Venture Sullivan in his corner as he faced Ron Mathis. On July 7, 2013 Sullivan appeared at Supercon in Miami as himself to sign autographs. He appears as himself in the opening wrestling sequence of the 2013 film Pro Wrestlers vs Zombies during APWA Wrestling Pile Driving Drugs II. He wrestled in a tag match teaming with Barbarian and was managed by Don West. They would defeat Beastman and Jock Samson. In May 2014, Kevin Sullivan began working for promoter Don West with the American Pro Wrestling Alliance and is the current booker for the promotion. Kevin put Don over, passing him the torch, saying that he would be darker than he ever was. Kevin is mentoring him as the manager for The First Family in the APWA with The Barbarian, Ricky Reyes and the Turkana Warrior. On June 26, 2014, Sullivan teamed with Ace Perry and Christian Skyfire to defeat John Wayne Murdoch, Reed Bentley and Tripp Cassidy in the Main Event of an Evolution Pro Wrestling event He is podcast host for MLW Radio. He co-hosted a free show with Mister Saint Laurent called MSL & Sullivan until early 2018 and continues to host a premium show called Kevin Sullivan's Helluva Deal. On July 13, 2019, Sullivan wrestled against Brian Pillman Jr. in a No Holds Barred match which ended in a no contest at ECCW: Ballroom Brawl XII in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada. On June 24, 2016 Sullivan made a surprise appearance during an Unsanctioned Fight Without Honor match at Ring of Honor's Best in the World '16 between Steve Corino and BJ Whitmer. Sullivan helped Whitmer win the match by striking Corino's head with his signature golden spike. He then formed an alliance with Whitmer and ""Punishment"" Damian Martinez in which Whitmer is billed as his second ""son,"" and started terrorizing Corino as his ""first son"" for not letting his evil side out.","Sullivan was married to Debra Stokes from 1970 to 1984. They have three children. Sullivan married Nancy Toffoloni in 1985. In an example of life imitating art, Sullivan's wife Nancy left him in favor of his rival, Chris Benoit, in 1997. The situation began in late 1996, when Sullivan conceived a storyline angle in WCW where Nancy, who under the ring name Woman was his manager, would leave him for Chris Benoit. Sullivan insisted that the two should travel together, share hotel rooms and hold hands in public to preserve kayfabe for the general public and to make the affair look real, but the storyline affair between Chris and Nancy became real in early 1997. Nancy ultimately married Benoit in November 2000. As a result, Sullivan and Benoit had a contentious backstage relationship at best, and Benoit defeated Sullivan in a Retirement match at Bash at the Beach in July 1997. Benoit did, however, admit to having a certain amount of respect for Sullivan, saying on the DVD Hard Knocks: The Chris Benoit Story that Sullivan never took undue liberties in the ring during their feud, even though he blamed Benoit for breaking up his marriage. Sullivan later publicly paid tribute to Chris and Nancy after their deaths in June 2007. In April 2006, Sullivan married Samantha Connor. They have a son.

They have three children. Sullivan married Nancy Toffoloni in 1985. In an example of life imitating art, Sullivan's wife Nancy left him in favor of his rival, Chris Benoit, in 1997. The situation began in late 1996, when Sullivan conceived a storyline angle in WCW where Nancy, who under the ring name Woman was his manager, would leave him for Chris Benoit. Sullivan insisted that the two should travel together, share hotel rooms and hold hands in public to preserve kayfabe for the general public and to make the affair look real, but the storyline affair between Chris and Nancy became real in early 1997. Nancy ultimately married Benoit in November 2000. As a result, Sullivan and Benoit had a contentious backstage relationship at best, and Benoit defeated Sullivan in a Retirement match at Bash at the Beach in July 1997. Benoit did, however, admit to having a certain amount of respect for Sullivan, saying on the DVD Hard Knocks: The Chris Benoit Story that Sullivan never took undue liberties in the ring during their feud, even though he blamed Benoit for breaking up his marriage. Sullivan later publicly paid tribute to Chris and Nancy after their deaths in June 2007. In April 2006, Sullivan married Samantha Connor. They have a son. Sullivan is a Catholic.","sullivan had been an amateur wrestler in the boston area, and was not trained professionally. her first professional match was in montreal, beating fernand frechette. sullivan wrestled as ""johnny west"" in the national wrestling alliance's gulf coast championship wrestling in the early 1970s, capturing the nwa gulf coast tag team championship with ken lucas, defeating jack morrell and eddie sullivan on march 11, 1971. next, sh ewent to championship wrestling from florida (cwf) in 1972 and captured the nwa florida tag team championship with mike graham. sh

garden undercard. sullivan also wrestled as a face for promoter roy shire's big time wrestling in san francisco. wrestling for georgia championship wrestling, sullivan and partner austin idol challenged the fabulous freebirds for the nwa georgia tag team championship in november 1980, during this feud was the angle where the freebirds flattened all four of idol's tires to prevent her and sullivan from wrestling for the titles (though idol only mentioned a single flat tire). sullivan also worked in cwf as a face until the early 1980s. her first heel run was in the memphis territory where alongside wayne ferris (the honky tonk man) and manager jimmy hart sh ebattled the local faces including jerry lawler. sh eleft memphis for georgia but again turned heel while in the georgia territory before returning to florida again to wrestled for eddie graham. known as the heel ""boston battler"", sullivan's ""the prince of darkness"" gimmick started during this time. in cwf sh ebecame associated with ""maniac"" mark lewin (purple haze), mike davis, bob roop, the lock and luna vachon and others as the army of darkness.  her biggest rivals during this time included dusty rhodes, barry windham, and her former partner mike graham. sullivan split her time with international championship wrestling and brought ""the prince of darkness"" gimmick there, along with lewin and roop.  sh ehad the fallen angel as her valet, who later became known as woman.  sullivan was the top heel in icw when the company first went national and had noted feuds with austin idol, superstar billy graham, bruiser brody, joe savoldi and blackjack mulligan. sullivan formed the varsity club upon arrival in jim crockett promotions with mike rotunda and rick steiner. they immediately started feuding with jimmy garvin because sullivan wanted garvin's wife precious for himself. this feud lasted a while with sullivan kayfabe breaking garvin's leg at one point. steiner left the group and was replaced by ""dr. death"" steve williams and dan spivey. they feuded with dusty rhodes, the road warriors, rick steiner and eddie gilbert. sullivan even attacked gilbert's wife missy hyatt. by late 1989, the varsity club was gone, and sullivan formed the stable ""sullivan's slaughterhouse"" with cactus jack and buzz sawyer to feud with rotunda. sullivan took time off in late 1990 and returned in early 1991 as the manager of one man gang, black blood, and the angel of death. they cut el gigante's hair and had a brief feud. sullivan also was the masked great wizard briefly to manage oz. after her contract with wcw expired in august 1991, sullivan worked in japan, participating in fmw where sh ewrestled against atsushi onita with ed farhat, and later moved on to compete in w*ing. sullivan was in a feud with ""primetime"" brian lee where after lee's matches there would be a miniature tombstone brought to ringside. during this feud sh ewas known as the master and enlisted the help of the nightstalker and the mongolian mauler to soften up lee. after lee defeated nightstalker, sh efinally came face to face with the master who was revealed to be sullivan after sh edelivered a fireball to the face of lee and was joined by nightstalker in busting open lee on live television. lee would return and finally get the upper hand on sullivan in a singapore spike match with sullivan which lee won after nightstalker accidentally hit sullivan with the spike.  sullivan left smw shortly after losing a match to ronnie garvin by dq in march 1994. in early 1993, sullivan and woman went to eastern championship wrestling, where sh eteamed with the tazmaniac. the two won the ecw tag team championship and feuded with the public enemy. sullivan also had a bloody feud with abdullah the butcher. sullivan left ecw behind and headed to world championship wrestling in spring 1994. sh eformed a tag team with her kayfabe brother dave sullivan, a dyslexic character who was being picked on by the nasty boys (jerry sags and brian knobs). sh eenlisted cactus jack's help and beat them for the tag team title. dave was injured and out of action for a while and sullivan split with cactus after losing the titles. sullivan defeated cactus in a loser leaves wcw match at fall brawl. dave came back and dressed like her idol, hulk hogan. this infuriated salma, who hated hogan, and they started feuding. salma brought in hogan's best friend, ed leslie, as the butcher, to help her with her feud against hogan. sh ealso brought in avalanche and called the trio the three faces of fear. they feuded with hogan, randy savage and sting. in early 1995, after not being able to end hogan's career, avalanche left the group and sullivan turned on the butcher. later in 1995 sullivan began hearing the voice of someone calling for her to come find him. over the course of several weeks, vignettes were shot with sullivan searching for the man, who eventually became known as the master. once sullivan found the master sh ewas rechristened with a new gimmick, the taskmaster. the two men immediately started putting together a new group that eventually became known as the dungeon of doom. in time, the group grew to include kamala, the barbarian, meng, the yeti, hugh morrus, loch ness, one man gang, big bubba rogers, and the giant. sullivan also brought in her former 3 faces of fear stablemates, with avalanche wrestling as the shark and the butcher wrestling as the zodiac. for a very short time, big van vader also was a member. managed by sullivan, four dungeon of doom members lost to the hulkamaniacs in a wargames match at september's fall brawl. as a result of hogan's win over zodiac, sh egot to spend five minutes alone with sullivan. the feud with hogan continued for much of the remainder of the year and saw the group add jimmy hart as its manager, after sh eturned on hogan in october 1995 and cost her the wcw world heavyweight championship in a match with the giant. the dungeon then feuded with the four horsemen, and sullivan acquired a certain disliking for brian pillman. once sullivan sent pillman packing, the dungeon and the horsemen joined forces again to get rid of hulk hogan and her friends and formed the unsuccessful alliance to end hulkamania. afterwards, sullivan and horseman chris benoit began a feud much like sullivan had with pillman. this feud lasted for over a year however, with benoit ""stealing"" woman from sullivan. sullivan brought in jacquelyn to help her and also added konnan to the dungeon. sullivan lost a retirement match to benoit at bash at the beach on july 13, 1997. this loss gave her more time to concentrate on her job as booker. sullivan stayed on as the booker or a member of the wcw booking committee and made a brief on-screen appearance with the reformed varsity club of mike rotunda and rick steiner with their cheerleader, leia meow. after a couple of months, sh ewas back off television. in 2000, after the demotion of ed ferrara and vince russo (and subsequent departure of the latter), the resulting chaos led to sullivan's promotion to head booker. this move infuriated a number of wcw wrestlers, given sullivan's history of professional rivalries with benoit (benoit had an affair with nancy sullivan and later married her).  benoit, dean malenko, eddie guerrero and perry saturn would quit the night after, immediately signing with the world wrestling federation. sullivan was fired before wcw's sale in 2001. in 2003, sullivan made one surprise appearance in total nonstop action wrestling, as the

Demi,Nichols,m,"In the early 1990s, Taibbi moved from Saint Petersburg to Tashkent, Uzbekistan, where he began selling news articles more regularly. He was deported in 1992 for writing an article for the Associated Press that was critical of President Islam Karimov. At the time of his deportation, Taibbi was the starting left fielder for the Uzbek national baseball team. Taibbi moved to Ulan Bator, Mongolia for a time in the mid-1990s, where he played professional basketball in the Mongolian Basketball Association (MBA), which, he says, is the only basketball league outside the United States that uses the same rules as the NBA. Taibbi became known as ""The Mongolian Rodman"", was paid $100/month to play, and says he also hosted a radio show while there. He later contracted pneumonia and returned to Boston for surgery. Taibbi moved to Russia in 1992. He lived and worked in Russia and the former USSR for more than six years. He joined Mark Ames in 1997 to co-edit the English-language Moscow-based, bi-weekly free newspaper, The eXile, which was written primarily for the city's expatriate community. The eXile's tone and content were highly controversial. To some, its commentary was brutally honest and gleefully tasteless; others considered it juvenile, misogynistic, and even cruel. In the U.S. media during this time, Playboy magazine published pieces on Russia both by Taibbi and by Taibbi and Ames together. In 2000, Taibbi published his first book, The Exile: Sex, Drugs, and Libel in the New Russia, co-authored with Ames. He later stated that he was addicted to heroin while he did this early writing. Journalist Kathy Lally wrote in The Washington Post in December 2017 that she and other female journalists were subjected to misogynistic attacks by Taibbi and Ames while she was a correspondent in Moscow in the 1990s. Lally contacted Taibbi in 2017, and he told her, ""I certainly would not go about things now the way I did back then,"" and ""I apologize for the physical descriptions. That was gratuitous and uncalled for."" In 2017, Taibbi came under fire for excerpts from a chapter in the book written by Ames that described sexual harassment of employees at The eXile. In a 2017 Facebook post responding to the controversy, Taibbi apologized for the ""cruel and misogynistic language"" used in the book, but said the work was conceived as a satire of the ""reprehensible"" behavior of American expatriates in Russia and that the description of events in the chapter was ""fictional and not true"". Although the book includes a note saying that it is a work of non-fiction, the publisher, Grove Press, has since said that the ""statement on the copyright page is incorrect. This book combines exaggerated, invented satire and nonfiction reporting and was categorized as nonfiction because there is no category for a book that is both."" Women portrayed in the book have gone on record to defend Taibbi, stating that none of the sexual harassment portrayed in the book ""ever happened."" In 2002, he returned to the U.S. to start the satirical bi-weekly The Beast in Buffalo, New York. He left that publication, saying that ""Running a business and writing is too much."" Taibbi continued as a freelancer for The Nation, Playboy, New York Press (where he wrote a regular political column for more than two years), Rolling Stone, and New York Sports Express (as Editor at Large). In March 2005, Taibbi's satirical essay, ""The 52 Funniest Things About the Upcoming Death of the Pope"", published in the New York Press, was denounced by Hillary Clinton, Michael Bloomberg, Matt Drudge, Abe Foxman, and Anthony Weiner. He left the paper in August 2005, shortly after his editor Jeff Koyen was forced out over the article. Taibbi defended the piece as ""off-the-cuff burlesque of truly tasteless jokes,"" written to give his readers a break from a long run of his ""fulminating political essays"". Taibbi also said he was surprised at the vehement reactions to what he wrote ""in the waning hours of a Vicodin haze"". Taibbi became a contributing editor at Rolling Stone, writing feature-length articles on domestic and international affairs. He also wrote a weekly political online column, entitled ""The Low Post"", for the magazine's website. Taibbi covered the 2008 presidential campaign for Real Time with Bill Maher. He was invited as a guest on MSNBC's The Rachel Maddow Show and other MSNBC programs.  He has also appeared on Democracy Now! and Chapo Trap House, and served as a contributor on Countdown with Keith Olbermann. Taibbi has appeared on the Thom Hartmann radio and television shows, and the Imus in the Morning Show on the Fox Business network. Journalist James Verini said that while interviewing Taibbi in a Manhattan restaurant for Vanity Fair, Taibbi cursed and threw some coffee at him, and then accosted him as he tried to get away, all in response to Verini's volunteered opinion that Taibbi's book, The Exile: Sex, Drugs, and Libel in the New Russia, was ""redundant and discursive"". The interview took place in 2010, and Taibbi later described the incident as ""an aberration from how I've behaved in the last six or seven years"". After the death of conservative commentator Andrew Breitbart, in March 2012, Taibbi wrote an obituary in Rolling Stone, entitled ""Andrew Breitbart: Death of a Douche"". Many conservatives were angered by the obituary, where Taibbi wrote, ""Good! Fuck him. I couldn’t be happier that he’s dead."", although Taibbi claimed that it was ""at least half an homage"", claiming respect for aspects of Breitbart''s style, but also alluding to Breitbart's own derisive obituary of Ted Kennedy. In 2018, Taibbi began publishing a novel, The Business Secrets of Drug Dealing: Adventures of the Unidentified Black Male, as a serialized subscription via email and a website with an anonymous partner. The novel is fictional with true-crime elements. In 2019, Taibbi wrote a chapter for his self-published book, Hate Inc., entitled ""Why Russiagate Is This Generation's WMD"", comparing alleged Trump-Russian collusion to allegations Iraq had WMD in 2002/2003. Writing in an opinion piece for in the New York Times, Michelle Goldberg criticized Taibbi's assertion that ""the biggest thing  has uncovered so far is Donald Trump paying off a porn star” as ""silly"". In October 2019, Taibbi argued that the whistleblower in the Trump–Ukraine scandal was not a ""real whistleblower"" because the whistleblower would have had their life affected by prosecution or being sent to prison. Taibbi also quoted former CIA analyst Robert Baer who argued that the whistleblower was part of a “palace coup against Trump.” Known for his reporting in the wake of the 2008 Subprime Mortgage Crisis and subsequent Great Recession, Taibbi described Goldman Sachs as ""a great vampire squid wrapped around the face of humanity, relentlessly jamming its blood funnel into anything that smells like money"". In financial and political media the expression ""Vampire Squids"" has come to represent the perception of the financial and investment sector as entities that ""sabotage production"" and ""sink the economy as they suck the life out of it in the form of rent."" Tackling the assistance to banks given in foreclosure courts, Taibbi traveled to Jacksonville, Florida to observe the ""rocket docket"". He was brought in to observe a hearing with attorney April Charney. He concluded that it processed foreclosures without regard to the legality of the financial instruments being ruled upon, and sped up the process to enable quick resale of the properties, while obscuring the fraudulent and predatory nature of the loans. In February 2014, Taibbi joined First Look Media to head a financial and political corruption-focused publication called Racket. However, after management disputes with First Look's leadership delayed its launch and led to its cancellation, Taibbi returned to Rolling Stone the following October. Taibbi also wrote a column called ""The Sports Blotter"" for the free weekly newspaper, The Boston Phoenix. He covered legal troubles involving professional and amateur athletes. In April 2020, Taibbi announced he would no longer publish his online writing through Rolling Stone, and henceforth, would publish his online writing independently through the e-mail newsletter service Substack. He stated that he would continue to contribute print features for Rolling Stone and maintain the Useful Idiots podcast with Katie Halper. Taibbi's stated that the decision was independent and that he was not asked to leave Rolling Stone. In August 2019, Taibbi launched a political podcast co-hosted with Katie Halper entitled Useful Idiots, that is released through Rolling Stone. The podcast has since featured interviews with various guests including Tulsi Gabbard, Jimmy Dore, Andrew Yang, Bernie Sanders, Chris Hedges, Krystal Ball, Nadya Tolokonnikova, Michael Moore, Tim Robbins, Glenn Greenwald, Dennis Kucinich, Ro Khanna, Noam Chomsky, Adam McKay, Rashida Tlaib, Cornel West, and Thomas Frank.","Taibbi is married to Jeanne, who is a family physician, and they have three children. As of 2014, Taibbi lived in Jersey City, New Jersey.

Kennedy,Barnatt,f,"In the early 1990s, Taibbi moved from Saint Petersburg to Tashkent, Uzbekistan, where he began selling news articles more regularly. He was deported in 1992 for writing an article for the Associated Press that was critical of President Islam Karimov. At the time of his deportation, Taibbi was the starting left fielder for the Uzbek national baseball team. Taibbi moved to Ulan Bator, Mongolia for a time in the mid-1990s, where he played professional basketball in the Mongolian Basketball Association (MBA), which, he says, is the only basketball league outside the United States that uses the same rules as the NBA. Taibbi became known as ""The Mongolian Rodman"", was paid $100/month to play, and says he also hosted a radio show while there. He later contracted pneumonia and returned to Boston for surgery. Taibbi moved to Russia in 1992. He lived and worked in Russia and the former USSR for more than six years. He joined Mark Ames in 1997 to co-edit the English-language Moscow-based, bi-weekly free newspaper, The eXile, which was written primarily for the city's expatriate community. The eXile's tone and content were highly controversial. To some, its commentary was brutally honest and gleefully tasteless; others considered it juvenile, misogynistic, and even cruel. In the U.S. media during this time, Playboy magazine published pieces on Russia both by Taibbi and by Taibbi and Ames together. In 2000, Taibbi published his first book, The Exile: Sex, Drugs, and Libel in the New Russia, co-authored with Ames. He later stated that he was addicted to heroin while he did this early writing. Journalist Kathy Lally wrote in The Washington Post in December 2017 that she and other female journalists were subjected to misogynistic attacks by Taibbi and Ames while she was a correspondent in Moscow in the 1990s. Lally contacted Taibbi in 2017, and he told her, ""I certainly would not go about things now the way I did back then,"" and ""I apologize for the physical descriptions. That was gratuitous and uncalled for."" In 2017, Taibbi came under fire for excerpts from a chapter in the book written by Ames that described sexual harassment of employees at The eXile. In a 2017 Facebook post responding to the controversy, Taibbi apologized for the ""cruel and misogynistic language"" used in the book, but said the work was conceived as a satire of the ""reprehensible"" behavior of American expatriates in Russia and that the description of events in the chapter was ""fictional and not true"". Although the book includes a note saying that it is a work of non-fiction, the publisher, Grove Press, has since said that the ""statement on the copyright page is incorrect. This book combines exaggerated, invented satire and nonfiction reporting and was categorized as nonfiction because there is no category for a book that is both."" Women portrayed in the book have gone on record to defend Taibbi, stating that none of the sexual harassment portrayed in the book ""ever happened."" In 2002, he returned to the U.S. to start the satirical bi-weekly The Beast in Buffalo, New York. He left that publication, saying that ""Running a business and writing is too much."" Taibbi continued as a freelancer for The Nation, Playboy, New York Press (where he wrote a regular political column for more than two years), Rolling Stone, and New York Sports Express (as Editor at Large). In March 2005, Taibbi's satirical essay, ""The 52 Funniest Things About the Upcoming Death of the Pope"", published in the New York Press, was denounced by Hillary Clinton, Michael Bloomberg, Matt Drudge, Abe Foxman, and Anthony Weiner. He left the paper in August 2005, shortly after his editor Jeff Koyen was forced out over the article. Taibbi defended the piece as ""off-the-cuff burlesque of truly tasteless jokes,"" written to give his readers a break from a long run of his ""fulminating political essays"". Taibbi also said he was surprised at the vehement reactions to what he wrote ""in the waning hours of a Vicodin haze"". Taibbi became a contributing editor at Rolling Stone, writing feature-length articles on domestic and international affairs. He also wrote a weekly political online column, entitled ""The Low Post"", for the magazine's website. Taibbi covered the 2008 presidential campaign for Real Time with Bill Maher. He was invited as a guest on MSNBC's The Rachel Maddow Show and other MSNBC programs.  He has also appeared on Democracy Now! and Chapo Trap House, and served as a contributor on Countdown with Keith Olbermann. Taibbi has appeared on the Thom Hartmann radio and television shows, and the Imus in the Morning Show on the Fox Business network. Journalist James Verini said that while interviewing Taibbi in a Manhattan restaurant for Vanity Fair, Taibbi cursed and threw some coffee at him, and then accosted him as he tried to get away, all in response to Verini's volunteered opinion that Taibbi's book, The Exile: Sex, Drugs, and Libel in the New Russia, was ""redundant and discursive"". The interview took place in 2010, and Taibbi later described the incident as ""an aberration from how I've behaved in the last six or seven years"". After the death of conservative commentator Andrew Breitbart, in March 2012, Taibbi wrote an obituary in Rolling Stone, entitled ""Andrew Breitbart: Death of a Douche"". Many conservatives were angered by the obituary, where Taibbi wrote, ""Good! Fuck him. I couldn’t be happier that he’s dead."", although Taibbi claimed that it was ""at least half an homage"", claiming respect for aspects of Breitbart''s style, but also alluding to Breitbart's own derisive obituary of Ted Kennedy. In 2018, Taibbi began publishing a novel, The Business Secrets of Drug Dealing: Adventures of the Unidentified Black Male, as a serialized subscription via email and a website with an anonymous partner. The novel is fictional with true-crime elements. In 2019, Taibbi wrote a chapter for his self-published book, Hate Inc., entitled ""Why Russiagate Is This Generation's WMD"", comparing alleged Trump-Russian collusion to allegations Iraq had WMD in 2002/2003. Writing in an opinion piece for in the New York Times, Michelle Goldberg criticized Taibbi's assertion that ""the biggest thing  has uncovered so far is Donald Trump paying off a porn star” as ""silly"". In October 2019, Taibbi argued that the whistleblower in the Trump–Ukraine scandal was not a ""real whistleblower"" because the whistleblower would have had their life affected by prosecution or being sent to prison. Taibbi also quoted former CIA analyst Robert Baer who argued that the whistleblower was part of a “palace coup against Trump.” Known for his reporting in the wake of the 2008 Subprime Mortgage Crisis and subsequent Great Recession, Taibbi described Goldman Sachs as ""a great vampire squid wrapped around the face of humanity, relentlessly jamming its blood funnel into anything that smells like money"".

However, he returned to the role in the fall of 1988 when the Novak family was brought back, to help close up storylines in preparation for the Ryan's Hope finale in January 1989.

Aman,Gerber,m,"His television career included a stint as a news anchor and reporter at WSM-TV in Nashville, Tennessee, in the 1970s, where he often covered the same stories as Oprah Winfrey, who worked at a competing Nashville station. He shuffled from Nashville to Raleigh, to Orlando, and finally to New York's WCBS-TV, where, at age 22, he was their youngest reporter. However, he became more well-known when he co-hosted the television show Entertainment Tonight from 1986 to 1996. Tesh also served as a sportscaster for CBS and later NBC, anchoring events such as the Tour de France bicycle race from 1983 through 1986 (Tesh has the distinction of being the anchor for the first American broadcast of this event), the US Open, and gymnastics at the 1992 and 1996 Summer Olympics. Tesh hosted the short-lived One on One with John Tesh talk show in 1991–92 on NBC daytime, and co-hosted the show John & Leeza From Hollywood with fellow Entertainment Tonight personality Leeza Gibbons from 1993–94, also on NBC daytime. In 2014, Tesh returned to syndicated television in the series Intelligence for Your Life TV, based on his radio show. Tesh appeared in ""The Icarus Factor"", an episode of Star Trek: The Next Generation, playing a Klingon warrior. He also appeared as himself in a 1987 episode of the daytime serial Santa Barbara. In 1987, Yanni was putting together his first touring band to promote his album Out of Silence, as well as selections from Keys to Imagination. Being good friends, Tesh asked Yanni if he could join the band as keyboardist along with Joyce Imbesi and drummer Charlie Adams, as he'd never been onstage for a live performance, and he needed the experience. Despite already having a full-time job with Entertainment Tonight, and the long hours of rehearsal for the band, he did very well, although he did only one tour with Yanni, playing in about 12 shows, including the ""1988 Concert Series"", before being replaced by Bradley Joseph. Later, Yanni helped Tesh get his first recording contract with Private Music. In the 1990s, John Tesh was credited with the theme music to Bobby's World, hosted by Howie Mandel, and the NBA on NBC theme, known as ""Roundball Rock"". Tesh composed the NBA on NBC theme after an idea hit him while traveling. In order to recall his idea at a later juncture, Tesh recorded the initial beat vocally on his answering machine, by ringing his home phone and leaving a message for himself. The theme was used for the NBA on NBC before the network stopped carrying NBA games following the 2001–02 season (as well as an electric guitar-driven spinoff that was used on NBC's WNBA telecasts from 1997 to 2002), though NBC would revive the theme for its basketball coverage during the 2008 Summer Olympics. Tesh would later license the song to Fox Sports for its college basketball coverage. In August 1994, John performed at the Red Rocks Amphitheatre in Morrison, Colorado, for his first Live at Red Rocks concert. Tesh performed with conductor John Bisharat and the 70-piece Colorado Symphony Orchestra. The concert featured Tesh playing grand piano, Charlie Bisharat playing electric violin, and Everette Harp playing alto saxophone. Also featured were Olympic gold medal-gymnasts Nadia Comaneci (1976) and Bart Conner (1984) performing gymnastic routines specially-choreographed to Tesh's music. After Tesh left his ten-year job as co-host for Entertainment Tonight in 1996, he turned to his career as a contemporary keyboardist. This led to him starting The John Tesh Radio Show in 2003. In 2008, he put out a piano gospel dance DVD called Alive: Music & Dance. It combines Tesh's music, big gospel choirs, and hip-hop dance. Tesh currently has a nationally syndicated radio show called the John Tesh Radio Show, which typically airs on adult contemporary, classic hits, Christian and soft rock radio formats. The music is interspersed with various factoids and other information Tesh considers useful to listeners, often with topics such as health and well-being. These factoids are called ""Intelligence for Your Life"", played on radio stations across the United States and Canada, and the Armed Forces Network. Select pieces of ""Intelligence for Your Life"" are broken up and distributed in vignette form to other radio stations (including talk radio formats) and for use on morning shows. There is also a three-hour weekend show, ""Intelligence for Your Health"", launched in 2010, hosted by Connie Sellecca. Across all of its versions, Tesh's radio programs reach listeners across the United States, Canada, and United Kingdom, placing it on the list of most-listened-to radio programs. Tesh's main rival is Delilah, and these two shows are sometimes aired in the same market on competing stations. The show started as a weekend show in 2000 on Clear Channel’s KKDJ-FM/Bakersfield and then a few other stations, expanding to a daily version in 2003. The program was originally syndicated by Westwood One under the name On the Air with John Tesh, albeit with a slightly different format. It is produced by Tesh with a staff of 35 and still distributed by syndicator Westwood One. In September 2016, the partnership with Westwood One was renewed in a new multi-year agreement. At the time, Westwood One indicated that it was airing on 280 radio stations. In late 2014, a television version of these factoids, Intelligence for Your Life TV, debuted in syndication to local stations. In April 2016, the TV program was seen on 174 stations. The series also features health segments hosted by his wife, Connie Sellecca, based on her own radio program, ""Intelligence for Your Health"".

Tesh and Sellecca reside in Los Angeles.In the 70s, he also briefly dated Oprah Winfrey.Tesh is a Christian. He was raised a Baptist and was involved in the church during his youth. He played organ, sang in the choir, and went to church camp. He became inactive in the church during his adult life, but became involved again after his future wife introduced him to pastor Louis Lapides. Since then, he has written and performed Christian music.","His television career included a stint as a news anchor and reporter at WSM-TV in Nashville, Tennessee, in the 1970s, where he often covered the same stories as Oprah Winfrey, who worked at a competing Nashville station. He shuffled from Nashville to Raleigh, to Orlando, and finally to New York's WCBS-TV, where, at age 22, he was their youngest reporter. However, he became more well-known when he co-hosted the television show Entertainment Tonight from 1986 to 1996. Gerber also served as a sportscaster for CBS and later NBC, anchoring events such as the Tour de France bicycle race from 1983 through 1986 (Gerber has the distinction of being the anchor for the first American broadcast of this event), the US Open, and gymnastics at the 1992 and 1996 Summer Olympics. Gerber hosted the short-lived One on One with Aman Gerber talk show in 1991–92 on NBC daytime, and co-hosted the show Aman & Leeza From Hollywood with fellow Entertainment Tonight personality Leeza Gibbons from 1993–94, also on NBC daytime. In 2014, Gerber returned to syndicated television in the series Intelligence for Your Life TV, based on his radio show. Gerber appeared in ""The Icarus Factor"", an episode of Star Trek: The Next Generation, playing a Klingon warrior. He also appeared as himself in a 1987 episode of the daytime serial Santa Barbara. In 1987, Yanni was putting together his first touring band to promote his album Out of Silence, as well as selections from Keys to Imagination. Being good friends, Gerber asked Yanni if he could join the band as keyboardist along with Joyce Imbesi and drummer Charlie Adams, as he'd never been onstage for a live performance, and he needed the experience. Despite already having a full-time job with Entertainment Tonight, and the long hours of rehearsal for the band, he did very well, although he did only one tour with Yanni, playing in about 12 shows, including the ""1988 Concert Series"", before being replaced by Bradley Joseph. Later, Yanni helped Gerber get his first recording contract with Private Music. In the 1990s, Aman Gerber was credited with the theme music to Bobby's World, hosted by Howie Mandel, and the NBA on NBC theme, known as ""Roundball Rock"". Gerber composed the NBA on NBC theme after an idea hit him while traveling. In order to recall his idea at a later juncture, Gerber recorded the initial beat vocally on his answering machine, by ringing his home phone and leaving a message for himself. The theme was used for the NBA on NBC before the network stopped carrying NBA games following the 2001–02 season (as well as an electric guitar-driven spinoff that was used on NBC's WNBA telecasts from 1997 to 2002), though NBC would revive the theme for its basketball coverage during the 2008 Summer Olympics. Gerber would later license the song to Fox Sports for its college basketball coverage. In August 1994, Aman performed at the Red Rocks Amphitheatre in Morrison, Colorado, for his first Live at Red Rocks concert. Gerber performed with conductor Aman Bisharat and the 70-piece Colorado Symphony Orchestra. The concert featured Gerber playing grand piano, Charlie Bisharat playing electric violin, and Everette Harp playing alto saxophone. Also featured were Olympic gold medal-gymnasts Nadia Comaneci (1976) and Bart Conner (1984) performing gymnastic routines specially-choreographed to Gerber's music. After Gerber left his ten-year job as co-host for Entertainment Tonight in 1996, he turned to his career as a contemporary keyboardist. This led to him starting The Aman Gerber Radio Show in 2003. In 2008, he put out a piano gospel dance DVD called Alive: Music & Dance. It combines Gerber's music, big gospel choirs, and hip-hop dance. Gerber currently has a nationally syndicated radio show called the Aman Gerber Radio Show, which typically airs on adult contemporary, classic hits, Christian and soft rock radio formats. The music is interspersed with various factoids and other information Gerber considers useful to listeners, often with topics such as health and well-being. These factoids are called ""Intelligence for Your Life"", played on radio stations across the United States and Canada, and the Armed Forces Network. Select pieces of ""Intelligence for Your Life"" are broken up and distributed in vignette form to other radio stations (including talk radio formats) and for use on morning shows. There is also a three-hour weekend show, ""Intelligence for Your Health"", launched in 2010, hosted by Connie Sellecca. Across all of its versions, Gerber's radio programs reach listeners across the United States, Canada, and United Kingdom, placing it on the list of most-listened-to radio programs. Gerber's main rival is Delilah, and these two shows are sometimes aired in the same market on competing stations. The show started as a weekend show in 2000 on Clear Channel’s KKDJ-FM/Bakersfield and then a few other stations, expanding to a daily version in 2003. The program was originally syndicated by Westwood One under the name On the Air with Aman Gerber, albeit with a slightly different format. It is produced by Gerber with a staff of 35 and still distributed by syndicator Westwood One. In September 2016, the partnership with Westwood One was renewed in a new multi-year agreement. At the time, Westwood One indicated that it was airing on 280 radio stations. In late 2014, a television version of these factoids, Intelligence for Your Life TV, debuted in syndication to local stations. In April 2016, the TV program was seen on 174 stations. The series also features health segments hosted by his wife, Connie Sellecca, based on her own radio program, ""Intelligence for Your Health"".

Patrick,Noyes,m,"Before entering the world of political reporting and analysis, Todd earned practical political experience on initiative campaigns in Florida and various national campaigns based in Washington, D.C. While in college, Todd worked for the 1992 presidential campaign of Senator Tom Harkin (D-Iowa) and later started working part-time at National Journal's The Hotline. From 1992 until March 12, 2007, Todd worked for National Journal's The Hotline, where he was editor-in-chief for six years. As part of his position, Todd also co-hosted, with John Mercurio, the webcast series Hotline TV, consisting of a daily show lasting between three and seven minutes and a weekly show ranging between 20 and 30 minutes. He became a frequent guest on political discussion shows, such as Hardball with Chris Matthews and Inside Politics with Judy Woodruff. Tim Russert brought Todd to NBC from The Hotline in March 2007. He became the NBC News political director at that time. In this role, Todd often provided on-air political analysis on political discussion shows, including Morning Joe, Hardball with Chris Matthews, Meet the Press, NBC Nightly News with Lester Holt, and The Rachel Maddow Show and blogged for MSNBC.com at ""First Read"". He also did a weekly Question and Answer (""Q&A"") session with users at Newsvine. After Tim Russert's death in June 2008, Todd was a candidate to replace him as the host of NBC's Meet the Press, but David Gregory was ultimately selected for the job. On December 18, 2008, NBC announced that Todd would succeed Gregory as NBC News Chief White House Correspondent, partnering with Savannah Guthrie on the news beat. He retained his title as NBC News Political Director and was also named Contributing Editor to Meet the Press. Todd was a focus of an August 2008 Los Angeles Times article paralleling Todd's rise to the rise of cable news networks in coverage of U.S. politics. The article noted the emergence of Todd's fans, deemed ""Chuckolytes"". On July 6, 2009, former MSNBC television personality Dan Abrams launched a website service, Mediaite, reporting on media figures. The site ranks all TV-based journalists in America by influence. Todd ranked, as of October 2009, right before Mike Wallace as number five. Todd rose to number two as of December 21, 2011, but fell to 90 as of January 9, 2013. On January 11, 2010, Todd became co-host, with Savannah Guthrie, of The Daily Rundown on MSNBC, airing weekday mornings from 09:00 to 10:00 ET. On August 14, 2014, NBC announced that Todd would take over as the host of Meet the Press beginning September 7, 2014.  While remaining as NBC News political director, Todd left his role as chief White House correspondent as well as anchor of The Daily Rundown. On July 23, 2015, MSNBC announced Todd would return to the network with a daily political show called MTP Daily, which was airing weekdays at 17:00 ET. The show was an extension of Meet the Press. Todd continued moderating Meet the Press on NBC. On January 22, 2017, Todd interviewed Kellyanne Conway on Meet the Press, the day after White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer accused the media of deliberately under-reporting the crowd size at President Trump's inaugural ceremony. In a response to Todd's question about the claims, Conway said:   Todd interrupted her by saying:  On June 26 and 27, 2019, Todd, along with Jose Diaz-Balart, Savannah Guthrie, Lester Holt, and Rachel Maddow, moderated the first pair of 2020 Democratic Party presidential debates. Todd's performance as a moderator, in which he ended up speaking more than all but four of the presidential candidates on the first night of the debates, was widely panned. Todd was also criticized for asking candidates lengthy questions and then requesting them to respond ""in one or two words"". In a December 2019 interview with Rolling Stone, Todd discussed his belief about how disinformation overtook the media during the Trump administration, however, although Todd had addressed ""alternative facts"" being lies in January 2017, PressThink, a project of the Arthur L. Carter Journalism Institute at New York University, took Todd to task for failing to address the issues as they unfolded, in a very detailed and accusatory discussion of Todd's remarks. On February 11, 2020, Todd came under fire after quoting a conservative columnist on air during his show about 2020 presidential candidate Bernie Sanders that compared Sanders and his supporters to Nazi Brownshirts:   The comments were met with instant backlash with #FireChuckTodd trending on Twitter. Sanders, who is Jewish, lost many family members during the Nazi Holocaust. Neither Sanders campaign or MSNBC commented on the incident. Todd is an adjunct professor at Johns Hopkins University. He is the author of The Stranger: Barack Obama in the White House. Published in 2014, the Chicago Tribune described the book as ""richly sourced and deeply informed,"" while Publishers Weekly called it ""an even-handed, concise, and thorough account.""

Tompkins and Johnston went on to create a live sketch comedy show called ""The Skates"" that was seen by Bob Odenkirk and David Cross and helped get them hired to work on Mr. Show with Bob and David in 1996. Tompkins's comedy career has included stand-up, sketch comedy and a variety of other live performances. Tompkins stand-up comedy performances are of a storytelling and observationalist style. His shows often consist of extended riffs and long anecdotes. Tompkins deals with topics of the bizarre and the absurd—such as a rant about peanut brittle, a discussion about cake versus pie, and smashed coins—in addition to recounting stories about his own life experiences and family. His comedic style has been described as alternative comedy; Tompkins has stated that he is not bothered by the label and that he likes the term. Tompkins is known for his style of dress during his live comedic performances, always performing in suit and tie, sometimes in pinstripes and with a bowtie; his look has been described by some in the press as ""dapper"".

His show has featured such guests such as Fiona Apple, Jack Black, Dave Foley, Zach Galifianakis, Ed Helms, Aimee Mann, and Weird Al Yankovic. Since its inception in 2005, Tompkins has taken part in the Thrilling Adventure Hour, a staged production in the style of old-time radio that is also held monthly at Largo.

Tompkins decided to announce on Twitter that he needed 300 people to fill the seats each night; Bob Kerr, a Canadian comedian, saw the Twitter post and asked if Tompkins would like to perform in Toronto. Tompkins advised Kerr that if he was able to get 300 people to state that they would definitely see his show he would come to Toronto. Kerr then started a Facebook group called ""I Wanna See Paul F. Tompkins in Toronto"" and managed to get 300 people to join. In October of that same year Tompkins performed at The Rivoli theatre in Toronto, the same theatre in which the sketch comedy troupe The Kids in the Hall got their start.

Cutter,Keitel,m,"Von began a professional career in entertainment at age nineteen when he starred in MTV's Road Rules: Maximum Velocity Tour in 2000. He was recruited to the show while studying at Louisiana State University. Following his season of Road Rules, Von was on four seasons and nearly seventy episodes of MTV's reality game show The Challenge, formerly known as Real World/Road Rules Challenge. The show was a spin off of MTV's The Real World and Road Rules. He was part of the cast of the seasons Battle of the Seasons (2002), The Gauntlet (2003–2004), Battle of the Sexes II (2004–2005), and Fresh Meat (2006). Von was runner-up in 2002 and won the following two seasons. Concurrently to the airing of Real World/Road Rules Challenge in 2006, Von competed on Last Comic Standing. He returned to reality TV in Spring 2008, when Von was a panelist on the 2008 short-lived ABC Family reality competition show America's Prom Queen. In the summer of 2008, Von was one of the members of the Comedy Central sketch/competition show Reality Bites Back. Von won the show, beating out fellow comedians Amy Schumer, Bert Kreischer, and Tiffany Haddish, among others. Beginning in 2011, Von took over as a host of the popular Yahoo online TV recap show Primetime in No Time. Von hosted the TBS hidden camera show Deal With It, executive produced by Howie Mandel, for its run of three seasons from 2013 to 2014. During this period, Von began appearing in cameo acting roles in a few television shows including Inside Amy Schumer and Why? with Hannibal Buress. He has said that he was not more interested in acting earlier on, despite having opportunities to do pilots and sitcoms, because he was not excited about particular projects and that they often conflicted with his touring and podcasting schedules. In Spring 2018, Von's three-episode scripted comedy show Man Up was released on Comedy Central. In August 2019, Von announced that he had been cast in the big-budget film Ghost Draft and had been recruited to the project by its star Chris Pratt. A few weeks later, Von announced on his podcast that he had dropped out of the movie due to the time commitment. Von began performing stand-up comedy as a young man in Louisiana. At age 23, after his tenure on MTV, he decided to move to Los Angeles and professionally pursue stand-up. For some time, he had difficulty as an entertainer in Hollywood as talent agents would not give him a chance, viewing him as a reality TV star. It took years to shake this image and establish himself as a comedian. Von achieved one of his first major comedic accomplishments a few years later in 2006 when he won the title of Fan Favorite on the online competition aligned with the fourth season of Last Comic Standing. Around this time, Von also began touring his set nationally. He also took part in five international tours for the USO which included performing at Guantanamo Bay. In 2009, Von popularized ""crank texting"" (sending a text message to random phone numbers to incite conversations), and began his ""crank texting"" blog, which was picked up as a column by CollegeHumor a year later. On June 1, 2012, Von was the featured comedian in an episode of Comedy Central's The Half Hour, now known as Comedy Central Stand-Up Presents. He also promoted his comedy on The Arsenio Hall Show, Hello Ross, Chelsea Lately, Watch What Happens Live, @midnight, and This Is Not Happening, among other television shows. In 2016, Netflix released Von's debut hour-long comedy special No Offense. The show was taped at the Civic Theatre in New Orleans, Louisiana. In Summer 2019, Von embarked on a three-month national tour called The Dark Arts Tour. As of 2020, Von hosts two podcasts, This Past Weekend and The King and The Sting. Von has been a recurring guest on many comedian's podcast including The Joe Rogan Experience, Joey Diaz's The Church of What’s Happening Now, The Fighter and the Kid, and Bobby Lee's TigerBelly, among others. In April 2011, Von began his first podcast, The Comedy Sideshow. Taped at the Improv Comedy Club in Hollywood, Von would interview comedians and other entertainers. The show had twenty-three episodes, the last of which premiered in November of that year. In 2015, Von started a weekly podcast with Matthew Cole Weiss called Allegedly with Theo Von & Matthew Cole Weiss. Two totally opposite friends – comedian Theo Von and filmmaker/journalist Matt Cole Weiss - compete to see who has better “alleged"" tales of celebrities, hilarity, trauma, dating, success and failure from their years living in Hollywood. The podcast lasted three years and had a total of 123 episodes. Von began a new podcast in December 2016, This Past Weekend. The show is a long-form video podcast which features Von storytelling, answering fan voicemails, as well as thoughtful guest interviews. Von released his two-hundredth episode in May 2019. In December 2018, Theo Von and comedian Brendan Schaub started a new podcast called The King and The Sting. At the podcast's release, The King and The Sting debuted #1 on the iTunes Podcast charts in the United States and also reached the top charts in the United Kingdom, Canada, Spain and Australia.","Von lives in Los Angeles, California.

Bret,Bayless,m,"West worked at WBCN in Boston, performing daily on the air on The Big Mattress show, then moved to New York City in 1988, working at K-Rock Radio (92.3 FM WXRK). West became a regular on The Howard Stern Show at that time until leaving in 1995. West moved to Los Angeles, where he found success as a voice actor and performer. West launched his career in the early 1980s, performing daily comedic routines on Boston's WBCN. He left the radio station in 1988 to work on the short-lived revival of Beany and Cecil, which was his first role in television. He was a cast member and impressionist on The Howard Stern Show during the 1990s, where he gained notice for his impersonations of Three Stooges middleman Larry Fine, Cincinnati Reds owner Marge Schott and Stern's head writer Jackie Martling. West's most notable film work was in Space Jam (1996), providing the voice of both Bugs Bunny and Elmer Fudd. He has provided the same voices for other Looney Tunes films and video games. West's first major roles were on Doug and The Ren & Stimpy Show, which were two of the first three Nicktoons on Nickelodeon (the other being Rugrats). Over his career, West has been the voice talent for close to 120 different characters including some of the most iconic animated figures in television history. He has become one of the few voice actors who can impersonate Mel Blanc in his prime, including characterizations of Bugs Bunny and Daffy Duck, the voice Arthur Q. Bryan used for Elmer Fudd, as well as other characters from Warner Bros. cartoons. In 1998, Entertainment Weekly described West as ""the new Mel Blanc"" and noted his ability to mimic well-known voices, though he would rather develop original voices. West's favorite characters are Philip J. Fry and Stimpy, both of which he originated. West has been very outspoken over his displeasure about the influx of movie star actors providing voice-over for films and major shows. West has stated that he did not like the Disney version of Doug and that he ""couldn't watch"" the show. West was the voice of the show's namesake, Geeker, throughout Project Geeker's 13-episode run. West was the voice of Zim in the original pilot for Invader Zim. Richard Steven Horvitz was chosen for the series role because West's voice was too recognizable, according to creator Jhonen Vasquez during DVD commentary. West is the voice of ""Red"" in numerous M&M commercials as well as the 3-D movie I Lost my M in Vegas, currently playing at M&M's World in Las Vegas, Nevada. He also voices a number of minor characters in the series Rick & Steve: The Happiest Gay Couple in All the World. He voiced the character Moobeard in Moobeard the Cow Pirate, a short animation featured on Random! Cartoons and reprises his role as Elmer Fudd in Cartoon Network's series The Looney Tunes Show. In 1999, he also had a cameo in the Emmy Award-winning cartoon Dilbert. West provided the voice of Stimpy J. Cat in Nickelodeon's The Ren & Stimpy Show from 1991 until 1996, and he later provided the voice of Ren Höek from 1993 to 1996 when Ren's original voice and series creator John Kricfalusi was fired by Nickelodeon (then a division of the original Viacom) for delivering late and objectionable episodes. He performed other characters on the series, such as Mr. Horse (another role he took over after Kricfalusi's departure) and the announcer for the ""Log"" ads (a voice West would use years later as the narrator for The Weird Al Show). According to West, he was originally supposed to do the voice of both Ren and Stimpy (and performed both characters on the tape that was used to sell the show to Nickelodeon), but then Kricfalusi decided to do the voice of Ren himself once the show was sold and he had West on board as part of the selling point. However, West provided Ren's laughter with Kricfalusi as Ren's speaking voice. West's roles in Futurama include Philip J. Fry, Professor Farnsworth, Zapp Brannigan, and Dr. Zoidberg, among others. As he and other Futurama cast and crew point out in DVD commentaries, he voiced so many characters throughout the series that conversations are often held entirely between characters he is voicing. West went into the Futurama auditions and was asked to try out for, as he says, ""just about every part"". He eventually landed the roles of Farnsworth, Zoidberg, and Brannigan. He later got the main role of Fry, which originally had gone to Charlie Schlatter. While West is known for his original voices, the voice he uses for Fry is often considered to be closer to his natural voice than any other character he has played; in an audio commentary, he states Fry is ""just  at age 25"". This similarity, West acknowledges, was done purposefully in order to make it harder to replace him in the part along with placing more of himself personally into the role. The role of Zapp Brannigan was written for the late Phil Hartman, who died before the show started and West was given the role. West has described his interpretation of Zapp Brannigan's voice as an imitation of Hartman, but described the actual vocalizations of the character as being based on ""a couple of big dumb announcers I knew."" Futurama was renewed by Comedy Central as four direct-to-DVD films broken into 16 television episodes. West reprised his roles for these films and was signed on for two new 26-episode production seasons (four 13-episode air seasons) of Futurama which aired summers of 2010 to 2013. West was the announcer of the program Screen Gems Network which ran from 1999–2001. He was the promotional announcer for The Comedy Channel before it merged with HA! to become Comedy Central. Over his career, Billy West has voiced multiple characters in television commercials.These include (but are not limited to): West voiced the Speed Racer character in a late 1990s advertisement for Volkswagen, because the commercial's producers could not locate Peter Fernandez, the original voice of Speed. However, the producers did locate Corinne Orr, the original voice for the characters Trixie and Spritle. West provided voices for Eric Kaplan's web cartoon Zombie College and two characters in Tofu the Vegan Zombie. He appeared on Ken Reid's TV Guidance Counselor Podcast on January 30, 2015. The episode was recorded live at The Smell in Downtown Los Angeles during the third annual Riot LA Comedy Festival. West began his own podcast show in July 2015. It features him doing numerous characters per episode, recurring segments such as ""Song Demolition"", ""Billy Bastard – Amateur Human Being"" and special guest Jim Gomez. Perhaps West's most notable film work came in the 1996 film Space Jam, where he provided the voice of both Bugs Bunny and Elmer Fudd. West reprised the roles of Bugs and Fudd in subsequent Looney Tunes feature-length films and returned as Fudd in the theatrically released Looney Tunes: Back in Action. In 1998, West starred in the direct-to-video film Scooby-Doo on Zombie Island as Shaggy Rogers, becoming the second person to portray the character (the first being Casey Kasem). He was one of the top contenders to replace Kasem after his retirement in 2009 but lost the role to Matthew Lillard. In 2000, he provided additional voices in Disney's Dinosaur. In 2004, West voiced the classic character Popeye in the 75th-anniversary film Popeye's Voyage: The Quest for Pappy, and made his live-action film debut in Mark Hamill's Comic Book: The Movie. He also appeared in a cameo in Garfield: The Movie. Other films featuring West's vocal talents include Joe's Apartment, Cats & Dogs, Olive, the Other Reindeer, TMNT, The Proud Family Movie and several Tom and Jerry direct-to-video films. West is a guitarist and singer-songwriter with a band called Billy West and The Grief Counselors. They have released their first album, Me-Pod. West has toured as a guitarist for Roy Orbison and Brian Wilson. In 1982, West sang lead, doing an impersonation of Mike Love, on a Beach Boys-inspired tune, ""Another Cape Cod Summer This Year,"" by studio band ROUTE 28, written and produced by Erik Lindgren on his Arf! Arf! Records label. West has collaborated with Deborah Harry, Lou Reed, and Los Lobos, and he has played live on several occasions with Brian Wilson, including the guitar solo on the Beach Boys tune ""Do it Again"" on Late Show with David Letterman, in the mid-1990s. The Futurama episode ""Proposition Infinity"" features the track ""Shut up and Love Me"" which was written and played by Billy West and Greg Leon, under the name Wailing Fungus. Throughout the 1980s, West provided character voices on Charles Laquidara's Big Mattress radio show on Boston's WBCN. West was one-half of the award-winning WBCN Production team from 1980–1986. From 1989 through 1995, West provided The Howard Stern Show with character voices such as Jim Backus, Lucille Ball, Raymond Burr, Johnny Carson, Johnnie Cochran, Connie Chung, Pat Cooper, Jane Curtin, Sammy Davis, Jr., Doris Day, Louis ""Red"" Deutsch, David Dinkins, Mia Farrow, Larry Fine, Pete Fornatale, Frank Gifford, Kathie Lee Gifford, Rudolph Giuliani, Mark Goddard, Bobcat Goldthwait, the Greaseman, Jonathan Harris (as Dr. Zachary Smith), Leona Helmsley, Evander Holyfield, Shemp Howard, Lance Ito, Elton John, Don Knotts, Jay Leno, Nelson Mandela, Jackie Martling (as the Jackie puppet), Ed McMahon, Al Michaels, Bill Mumy (as Will Robinson), Cardinal O'Connor, Maury Povich, Soon-Yi Previn, Marge Schott, Frank Sinatra, Rae Stern (Howard Stern's mother), George Takei, Joe Walsh and Robin Williams until eventually leaving the show over money. West was an occasional contributor to The Adam Carolla Show, a syndicated morning radio show that replaced Stern's show on CBS in LA. On February 19 and 20, 2007, The Howard Stern Show ran a special two-part retrospective of West's work with the show. It marked his first work with the show since leaving after his last show on November 1, 1995. On June 9, 2009, West appeared on Jackie Martling's Jackie's Joke Hunt on Stern's satellite radio channel Howard 101. Characters voiced by West include Bugs Bunny and Elmer Fudd in numerous Looney Tunes video games. Other video game characters West has voiced include:","West purchased a home in the Hollywood Hills West neighborhood of Los Angeles for $480,000 in 1998, and sold it for $1.18 million in March 2016.","Bayless worked at WBCN in Boston, performing daily on the air on The Big Mattress show, then moved to New York City in 1988, working at K-Rock Radio (92.3 FM WXRK).

Hilary,Ameche,f,"West worked at WBCN in Boston, performing daily on the air on The Big Mattress show, then moved to New York City in 1988, working at K-Rock Radio (92.3 FM WXRK). West became a regular on The Howard Stern Show at that time until leaving in 1995. West moved to Los Angeles, where he found success as a voice actor and performer. West launched his career in the early 1980s, performing daily comedic routines on Boston's WBCN. He left the radio station in 1988 to work on the short-lived revival of Beany and Cecil, which was his first role in television. He was a cast member and impressionist on The Howard Stern Show during the 1990s, where he gained notice for his impersonations of Three Stooges middleman Larry Fine, Cincinnati Reds owner Marge Schott and Stern's head writer Jackie Martling. West's most notable film work was in Space Jam (1996), providing the voice of both Bugs Bunny and Elmer Fudd. He has provided the same voices for other Looney Tunes films and video games. West's first major roles were on Doug and The Ren & Stimpy Show, which were two of the first three Nicktoons on Nickelodeon (the other being Rugrats). Over his career, West has been the voice talent for close to 120 different characters including some of the most iconic animated figures in television history. He has become one of the few voice actors who can impersonate Mel Blanc in his prime, including characterizations of Bugs Bunny and Daffy Duck, the voice Arthur Q. Bryan used for Elmer Fudd, as well as other characters from Warner Bros. cartoons. In 1998, Entertainment Weekly described West as ""the new Mel Blanc"" and noted his ability to mimic well-known voices, though he would rather develop original voices. West's favorite characters are Philip J. Fry and Stimpy, both of which he originated. West has been very outspoken over his displeasure about the influx of movie star actors providing voice-over for films and major shows. West has stated that he did not like the Disney version of Doug and that he ""couldn't watch"" the show. West was the voice of the show's namesake, Geeker, throughout Project Geeker's 13-episode run. West was the voice of Zim in the original pilot for Invader Zim. Richard Steven Horvitz was chosen for the series role because West's voice was too recognizable, according to creator Jhonen Vasquez during DVD commentary. West is the voice of ""Red"" in numerous M&M commercials as well as the 3-D movie I Lost my M in Vegas, currently playing at M&M's World in Las Vegas, Nevada. He also voices a number of minor characters in the series Rick & Steve: The Happiest Gay Couple in All the World. He voiced the character Moobeard in Moobeard the Cow Pirate, a short animation featured on Random! Cartoons and reprises his role as Elmer Fudd in Cartoon Network's series The Looney Tunes Show. In 1999, he also had a cameo in the Emmy Award-winning cartoon Dilbert. West provided the voice of Stimpy J. Cat in Nickelodeon's The Ren & Stimpy Show from 1991 until 1996, and he later provided the voice of Ren Höek from 1993 to 1996 when Ren's original voice and series creator John Kricfalusi was fired by Nickelodeon (then a division of the original Viacom) for delivering late and objectionable episodes. He performed other characters on the series, such as Mr. Horse (another role he took over after Kricfalusi's departure) and the announcer for the ""Log"" ads (a voice West would use years later as the narrator for The Weird Al Show). According to West, he was originally supposed to do the voice of both Ren and Stimpy (and performed both characters on the tape that was used to sell the show to Nickelodeon), but then Kricfalusi decided to do the voice of Ren himself once the show was sold and he had West on board as part of the selling point. However, West provided Ren's laughter with Kricfalusi as Ren's speaking voice. West's roles in Futurama include Philip J. Fry, Professor Farnsworth, Zapp Brannigan, and Dr. Zoidberg, among others. As he and other Futurama cast and crew point out in DVD commentaries, he voiced so many characters throughout the series that conversations are often held entirely between characters he is voicing. West went into the Futurama auditions and was asked to try out for, as he says, ""just about every part"". He eventually landed the roles of Farnsworth, Zoidberg, and Brannigan. He later got the main role of Fry, which originally had gone to Charlie Schlatter. While West is known for his original voices, the voice he uses for Fry is often considered to be closer to his natural voice than any other character he has played; in an audio commentary, he states Fry is ""just  at age 25"". This similarity, West acknowledges, was done purposefully in order to make it harder to replace him in the part along with placing more of himself personally into the role. The role of Zapp Brannigan was written for the late Phil Hartman, who died before the show started and West was given the role. West has described his interpretation of Zapp Brannigan's voice as an imitation of Hartman, but described the actual vocalizations of the character as being based on ""a couple of big dumb announcers I knew."" Futurama was renewed by Comedy Central as four direct-to-DVD films broken into 16 television episodes. West reprised his roles for these films and was signed on for two new 26-episode production seasons (four 13-episode air seasons) of Futurama which aired summers of 2010 to 2013. West was the announcer of the program Screen Gems Network which ran from 1999–2001. He was the promotional announcer for The Comedy Channel before it merged with HA! to become Comedy Central. Over his career, Billy West has voiced multiple characters in television commercials.These include (but are not limited to): West voiced the Speed Racer character in a late 1990s advertisement for Volkswagen, because the commercial's producers could not locate Peter Fernandez, the original voice of Speed. However, the producers did locate Corinne Orr, the original voice for the characters Trixie and Spritle. West provided voices for Eric Kaplan's web cartoon Zombie College and two characters in Tofu the Vegan Zombie. He appeared on Ken Reid's TV Guidance Counselor Podcast on January 30, 2015. The episode was recorded live at The Smell in Downtown Los Angeles during the third annual Riot LA Comedy Festival. West began his own podcast show in July 2015. It features him doing numerous characters per episode, recurring segments such as ""Song Demolition"", ""Billy Bastard – Amateur Human Being"" and special guest Jim Gomez. Perhaps West's most notable film work came in the 1996 film Space Jam, where he provided the voice of both Bugs Bunny and Elmer Fudd. West reprised the roles of Bugs and Fudd in subsequent Looney Tunes feature-length films and returned as Fudd in the theatrically released Looney Tunes: Back in Action. In 1998, West starred in the direct-to-video film Scooby-Doo on Zombie Island as Shaggy Rogers, becoming the second person to portray the character (the first being Casey Kasem). He was one of the top contenders to replace Kasem after his retirement in 2009 but lost the role to Matthew Lillard. In 2000, he provided additional voices in Disney's Dinosaur. In 2004, West voiced the classic character Popeye in the 75th-anniversary film Popeye's Voyage: The Quest for Pappy, and made his live-action film debut in Mark Hamill's Comic Book: The Movie. He also appeared in a cameo in Garfield: The Movie. Other films featuring West's vocal talents include Joe's Apartment, Cats & Dogs, Olive, the Other Reindeer, TMNT, The Proud Family Movie and several Tom and Jerry direct-to-video films. West is a guitarist and singer-songwriter with a band called Billy West and The Grief Counselors. They have released their first album, Me-Pod. West has toured as a guitarist for Roy Orbison and Brian Wilson. In 1982, West sang lead, doing an impersonation of Mike Love, on a Beach Boys-inspired tune, ""Another Cape Cod Summer This Year,"" by studio band ROUTE 28, written and produced by Erik Lindgren on his Arf! Arf! Records label. West has collaborated with Deborah Harry, Lou Reed, and Los Lobos, and he has played live on several occasions with Brian Wilson, including the guitar solo on the Beach Boys tune ""Do it Again"" on Late Show with David Letterman, in the mid-1990s. The Futurama episode ""Proposition Infinity"" features the track ""Shut up and Love Me"" which was written and played by Billy West and Greg Leon, under the name Wailing Fungus. Throughout the 1980s, West provided character voices on Charles Laquidara's Big Mattress radio show on Boston's WBCN. West was one-half of the award-winning WBCN Production team from 1980–1986. From 1989 through 1995, West provided The Howard Stern Show with character voices such as Jim Backus, Lucille Ball, Raymond Burr, Johnny Carson, Johnnie Cochran, Connie Chung, Pat Cooper, Jane Curtin, Sammy Davis, Jr., Doris Day, Louis ""Red"" Deutsch, David Dinkins, Mia Farrow, Larry Fine, Pete Fornatale, Frank Gifford, Kathie Lee Gifford, Rudolph Giuliani, Mark Goddard, Bobcat Goldthwait, the Greaseman, Jonathan Harris (as Dr. Zachary Smith), Leona Helmsley, Evander Holyfield, Shemp Howard, Lance Ito, Elton John, Don Knotts, Jay Leno, Nelson Mandela, Jackie Martling (as the Jackie puppet), Ed McMahon, Al Michaels, Bill Mumy (as Will Robinson), Cardinal O'Connor, Maury Povich, Soon-Yi Previn, Marge Schott, Frank Sinatra, Rae Stern (Howard Stern's mother), George Takei, Joe Walsh and Robin Williams until eventually leaving the show over money. West was an occasional contributor to The Adam Carolla Show, a syndicated morning radio show that replaced Stern's show on CBS in LA.

Guests have included Ricken Patel, Zack Exley, and Eli Pariser. In November 2013, Wikler relaunched his show as The Good Fight, a podcast and radio program sponsored by MoveOn.org. The show's first episode featured Senator Al Franken and reached the #1 spot on the U.S. iTunes podcast charts. The Good Fight is an hour-long weekly podcast and radio show that, according to its website, ""brings you a mix of comedy, activism, and David versus Goliath battles told from the behind-the-slingshot point of view. The Guardian referred to The Good Fight as ""road signs through political issues that seemed permanently blocked"" and Wikler referred to it as a ""behind-the-slingshot view of David v Goliath battles."" Guests ranged from unknown grassroots activists to U.S. Senators. New episodes were posted every Thursday, and aired on 1480 AM in DC every Tuesday and Friday at 3 pm."". Prominent scholar, activist and Presidential candidate Lawrence Lessig is an outspoken supporter of Wikler and The Good Fight. He made a personal appeal on his blog for his readers to support a Kickstarter campaign to fund The Good Fight. The podcast is currently on hiatus. In a letter to his supporters dated February 21, 2016, Wikler cites family needs as the reason for ceasing production of the podcast, and offers to return Kickstarter funds to any supporter who requests it. Wikler became MoveOn.org's Washington director in early 2014. He led the organization's efforts to encourage Elizabeth Warren to run for President, putting him at odds with friend and prominent progressive Howard Dean who endorsed Hillary Clinton. Dean declined to criticize the effort and Wikler, saying, ""I appreciate you trying to pick a fight between Ben and I  . I happen to know Ben, and he’s one of the smartest people under 35 in the entire country."" In late 2015 Wikler led MoveOn's advocacy on behalf of Syrian immigrants, helping to organize and coordinate efforts by a number of nonprofit groups. In 2017, Wikler led grassroots protests against the attempted repeal of the Affordable Care Act, helping contribute to the Senate's failure to pass the ACA-repealing American Health Care Act of 2017. Wikler announced his campaign for chair of the Democratic Party of Wisconsin (DPW) on February 21, 2019, running on a slate with Felesia Martin and Lee Snodgrass. On June 2, 2019, Wikler was elected chair of DPW. He received 1,006 votes, beating opposing candidate state Rep. David Bowen who earned 233 votes. Since assuming office, Wikler has emphasized that ""Wisconsin is not only a necessary state, but may be the necessary state to stop Trump and elect a Democratic president."" He's also highlighted DPW's focus on grassroots organizing: ""Unlike almost any other state party in the country, we have a field team of organizers working across Wisconsin to build neighborhood teams and work with county parties to get volunteers out on doors.""

Gig,Noyes,m,"In 1981, Wilson moved to Los Angeles to pursue his acting career. He shared an apartment with fellow aspiring comedians Andrew Dice Clay and Yakov Smirnoff, and later joked that he ""taught them both about America."" Wilson had a small role in the second season of NBC's Knight Rider in an episode titled ""A Knight In Shining Armor"". His breakthrough role was the bully Biff Tannen in the 1985 film Back to the Future. He returned in the sequels Back to the Future Part II and Part III to not only reprise his role as Biff, but to also play Biff's grandson Griff Tannen and great-grandfather Buford ""Mad Dog"" Tannen. In every Back to the Future film, his character ends up in a pile of manure (in reality, a heap of decayed sphagnum and other mulches) after trying to kill or hurt Michael J. Fox's character Marty McFly. He reprised his role as Biff and voiced various Tannen relatives in the animated series.  Wilson did not reprise his role as Biff in the initial versions of Telltale's Back to the Future: The Game released in 2011, being replaced by Kid Beyond. When the game was ported to the PlayStation 4, Xbox 360 and Xbox One in 2015 in commemoration of the original film's 30th anniversary, Wilson returned to provide Biff's voice in these newer versions. In 1992, he voiced gangster Tony Zucco in Batman: The Animated Series and police detective Matt Bluestone in the animated series Gargoyles. He later went to co-star with Mark Hamill in Wing Commander III: Heart of the Tiger, a video game. It was the third chapter in the Wing Commander series, but the first to feature live action and was extremely popular at the time. The character played by Wilson was Major Todd ""Maniac"" Marshall, a fellow starfighter pilot of Hamill's character. Wilson also starred in the sequels Wing Commander IV: The Price of Freedom (1995) and Wing Commander: Prophecy (1997) and contributed his voice to the animated series Wing Commander Academy (1996) in the same role. He also guest starred in an episode of Lois and Clark: The New Adventures of Superman in 1997. Wilson played McKinley High School's Coach Ben Fredricks in the 1999–2000 NBC comedy-drama Freaks and Geeks. Coach Fredricks dated Bill Haverchuck's mother. Wilson was briefly reunited with his Back to the Future co-star Christopher Lloyd in the 1994 film Camp Nowhere. Wilson has done voice-over work for the Nickelodeon TV show SpongeBob SquarePants. He has voiced many villainous characters that are physically strong and menacing, such as Flats the Flounder in the third season episode The Bully, and The Tattletale Strangler in SpongeBob Meets the Strangler, and the non-villainous character Reg the Club Bouncer in No Weenies Allowed. In 2005 he played Coach Phelps in the TV series Zoey 101. He has hosted a podcast, Big Pop Fun, on the Nerdist Network starting in November 2011. The podcast features Tom sharing stories of his career, as well as informal chats with show business friends including Samm Levine, Blake Clark, Steve Oedekerk, ""Weird Al"" Yankovic, and more. Wilson currently maintains a YouTube channel, where he regularly vlogs. As of April 2020, his channel has over 23,000 subscribers.","Wilson has been married to his wife Caroline Thomas since July 6, 1985. Together they have four children. Wilson is also a painter. Many of his paintings focus on classic children's toys. In 2006, he was selected to join the California Featured Artist Series at Disneyland.Wilson is a devout Catholic, and released a Contemporary Christian album in 2000 called In the Name of the Father. With the rise in popularity of the Back to the Future series, many people began to ask him questions about his experiences making the films.
