Jeffrey,Randall,m,"Banks signed with the Chicago Cubs in late 1953, making his major league debut on September 17 at age 22 and playing in 10 games at Wrigley Field. He was the Cubs' first black player; he became one of several former Negro league players who joined MLB teams without playing in the minor leagues. Larry Moffi and Jonathan Kronstadt wrote that he ""just was not the crusading type. He was so grateful to be playing baseball for a living, he did not have time to change the world, and if that meant some people called him an Uncle Tom, well, so be it."" During his first game for the Cubs, Banks received a visit from Jackie Robinson that influenced his quiet presence in baseball. Robinson told Banks, ""Ernie, I'm glad to see you're up here so now just listen and learn ... For years, I didn't talk and learned a lot about people"". Later, when Banks felt like becoming more vocal, he discussed the issue with teammate Billy Williams, who advised him to remain quiet. Williams drew the analogy of fish that are caught once they open their mouths. Banks said, ""I kept my mouth shut but tried to make a difference. My whole life, I've just wanted to make people better"". In 1954, Banks' double play partner during his official rookie season was Gene Baker, the Cubs' second black player. Banks and Baker roomed together on road trips and became the first all-black double-play combination in major league history. When Steve Bilko played first base, Cubs announcer Bert Wilson referred to the Banks-Baker-Bilko double play combination as ""Bingo to Bango to Bilko"". Banks hit 19 home runs and finished second to Wally Moon in Rookie of the Year voting. Banks participated in a trend toward lighter baseball bats after he accidentally picked up a teammate's bat and liked that it was easy to generate bat speed. In 1955, Banks hit 44 home runs, had 117 RBI and batted .295. He played and was the starting NL shortstop in his first of 13 All-Star Games that season. His home run total was a single-season record among shortstops. He also set a 30-year record of five single-season grand slam home runs. Banks finished third in 1955 in the league's Most Valuable Player (MVP) voting, behind Roy Campanella and Duke Snider. The Cubs finished with a 72–81 win-loss record, winning 29 of 77 road games. In 1956, Banks missed 18 games due to a hand infection, breaking his run of 424 consecutive games played. He finished the season with 28 home runs, 85 RBIs, and a .297 batting average. He made the All-Star selection as a reserve player but did not play in the game. In 1957, Banks finished the season with 43 home runs, 102 RBI, and a .285 batting average. In 1958 and 1959, Banks became the first NL player to be awarded back-to-back MVP Awards, leading the league in RBI in both those seasons (with 129 and 143, respectively) . Banks hit a major-league-leading 47 home runs in 1958, while batting .313, third best in the NL. The following year, he hit .304 with 45 home runs. In 1959, the Cubs came the closest to a winning season since Banks' arrival, finishing with a 74–80 record. Banks had a small role in an unusual play on June 30, 1959, when the St. Louis Cardinals played the Cubs at Wrigley Field. Stan Musial was at the plate facing Bob Anderson with a count of 3–1. Anderson's next pitch was errant, the ball evaded catcher Sammy Taylor and rolled all the way to the backstop. Umpire Vic Delmore called ""ball four"", but Anderson and Taylor contended that Musial foul tipped the ball. Because the ball was still in play and Delmore was embroiled in an argument with Anderson and Taylor, Musial tried to run for second base. Seeing that Musial was running to second, third baseman Alvin Dark ran to the backstop to retrieve the ball. The ball wound up in the hands of field announcer Pat Pieper, but Dark ended up getting it back anyway. Absentmindedly, however, Delmore pulled out a new baseball and gave it to Taylor. When Anderson noticed that Musial was trying for second, he took the new ball from Sammy Taylor and threw it towards Tony Taylor covering second base, and the ball went over Taylor's head into the outfield. At the same time that Anderson threw the new ball towards second baseman Taylor, Dark threw the original ball to shortstop Ernie Banks. Musial did not see the throw and he was declared out when the tag was made. In 1960, Banks hit a major league and NL-leading 41 HR, had 117 RBI, and led the NL in games played for the sixth time in seven years. He was also the first Cubs player to receive an annual NL Gold Glove award (for shortstop). On the eve of the 1960 World Series, Joe Reichler, a writer for the Associated Press, reported that the Milwaukee Braves were prepared to pay cash and trade pitchers Joey Jay, Carlton Willey and Don Nottebart, outfielder Billy Bruton, shortstop Johnny Logan and first baseman Frank Torre in exchange for Banks from the Cubs. In 1961, Banks experienced problems with a knee injury he had acquired while in the army. After 717 consecutive games, he removed himself from the Cubs lineup for at least four games, ending his pursuit of the record for playing in the most consecutive NL games of 895 games set by Stan Musial. In May, the Cubs announced that Jerry Kindall would replace Banks at shortstop and that Banks would move to left field. Banks later said, ""Only a duck out of water could have shared my loneliness in left field"". Banks credited center fielder Richie Ashburn with helping him learn to play left field; in 23 games Banks committed only one error. In June, he was moved to first base, learning that position from former first baseman and Cubs coach Charlie Grimm. He was not selected to be an All-Star for the first of two All-Star games that season since 1959, when MLB started having two All-Star Games per season through 1962, but was selected as a reserve player. Banks was a pinch hitter in the second All-Star game. The Cubs began playing under the College of Coaches in 1961, a system in which decisions were made by a group of 12 coaches rather than by one manager. By the 1962 season, Banks hoped to return to shortstop but the College of Coaches had determined that he would remain at first base indefinitely. In May 1962, Banks was hit in the head by a fastball from former Cubs pitcher Moe Drabowsky and was taken off the field unconscious. He sustained a concussion, spent two nights in a hospital, sat out a Monday game, and hit three home runs and a double on Tuesday. In May 1963, Banks set a single-game record of 22 putouts by a first baseman. However, he caught mumps that year and finished the season with 18 home runs, 64 RBI, and a .227 batting average. Despite Banks' struggles that season, the Cubs had their first winning record since the 1940s. Banks, following his doctor's orders, avoided his usual off-season participation in handball and basketball, and began the 1964 season weighing seven pounds (3.2 kg) more than the previous year. In February, Cubs second baseman Ken Hubbs was killed in an airplane crash. Banks finished the season with 23 home runs, 95 RBI, and a .264 batting average. The Cubs finished in eighth place in 1964, losing over $315,000. In 1965, Banks hit 28 home runs, had 107 RBI, a .265 batting average, and played and started at first base in the All-Star Game. On September 2, he hit his 400th home run. The Cubs finished the season with a baseball operations deficit of $1.2 million, though this was largely offset by television and radio revenue, and the rental of Wrigley Field to the Chicago Bears football team. The Cubs hired Leo Durocher as manager in 1966, hoping he could inspire renewed interest in the team's fan base. Banks hit only 15 home runs; Cubs finished the 1966 season in last place with a 59–103 win-loss record, the worst season of Durocher's career. From the time Durocher arrived in Chicago, he was frustrated at his inability to trade or bench the aging Banks. In Durocher's autobiography, he says: Banks said of Durocher, ""I wish there had been someone around like him early in my career ... He's made me go for that little extra needed to win"". Durocher served as Cubs manager until mid-1972, the season after Banks retired. In his memoir Mr. Cub, published around the time that Banks retired, Banks said too much had been made of the racial implications in his relationship with Durocher: The Cubs appointed Banks a player-coach for the 1967 season. Banks competed with John Boccabella for a starting position at first base. Shortly after, Durocher named Banks the outright starter at first base. Banks hit 23 home runs and drove in 95 runs, and went to the All-Star Game that year. After the 1967 season, an article in Ebony said Banks was not thought to have made more than $65,000 (equal to $498,398 today) in any season. He had received a pay increase from $33,000 to $50,000 between his MVP seasons in 1958 and 1959, but Ebony said several MLB players were making $100,000 at the time. Banks won the Lou Gehrig Memorial Award in 1968, an honor recognizing playing ability and personal character. The 37-year-old Banks hit 32 home runs, had 83 RBI, and finished that season with a .246 batting average. In 1969, he came the closest to helping the Cubs win the NL pennant; the Cubs fell from first place after holding an ​8 1⁄2-game lead in August. Banks made his 11th and final All-Star season appearance as a pinch hitter; it was his 14th All-Star Game appearance overall. Banks hit his 500th home run on May 12, 1970, at Chicago's Wrigley Field. On December 1, 1971, Banks retired as a player but continued to coach for the Cubs until 1973. He was an instructor in the minor leagues for the next three seasons and also worked in the Cubs' front office. Banks finished his career with 512 home runs; his 277 home runs as a shortstop were a career record at the time of his retirement. (Cal Ripken, Jr now holds the record for most home runs as a shortstop with 345.) Banks holds Cubs records for games played (2,528), at-bats (9,421), extra-base hits (1,009) and total bases (4,706). Banks also excelled as an infielder; he won an NL Gold Glove Award for shortstop in 1960. He led the NL in putouts five times and was the NL leader in fielding percentage as shortstop three times, and once as first baseman. Banks holds the major league record for most games played without a postseason appearance (2,528). In his memoir, citing his fondness for the Cubs and owner Philip K. Wrigley, Banks said he did not regret signing with the Cubs rather than one of the more successful baseball franchises. Banks' popularity and positive attitude led to the nicknames ""Mr. Cub"" and ""Mr. Sunshine"". Banks was known for his catchphrase, ""It's a beautiful day for a ballgame ... Let's play two!"", expressing his wish to play a doubleheader every day out of his love of baseball.","In 1953, after returning from military service in Germany, Banks married his first wife Mollye Ector. He proposed to her in a letter from Germany. Although he filed for divorce two years later, the couple briefly reconciled in early 1959. By that summer, they agreed on a divorce settlement that would pay $65,000 to Ector in lieu of alimony. Shortly thereafter, Banks eloped with Eloyce Johnson. The couple had twin sons within a year and a daughter four years after that. Ector filed suit against Banks in 1963 for failure to make payments on a life insurance policy agreed upon in their divorce settlement. Banks was a lifelong Republican – and he also once stated that ""I'm not goin' anywhere I'm not wanted"" – prompting critics to claim that he was ""soft"" on Jim Crow; he ran for alderman in Chicago in 1963. He ran in the 8th Ward against Democratic incumbent James A. Condon. In the Feb. 26 primary, Banks finished a distant third, garnering just 12% of the vote (Condon won re-election with 55%; Gerald Gibbons drew 25%). He later said, ""People knew me only as a baseball player. They didn't think I qualified as a government official and no matter what I did I couldn't change my image ... What I learned, was that it was going to be hard for me to disengage myself from my baseball life and I would have to compensate for it after my playing days were over."" Banks endorsed George W. Bush for president in 2004. In 1966, Banks worked for Seaway National Bank in the off-season and enrolled in a banking correspondence course. He bought into several business ventures, including a gas station, during his playing career. Though he had been paid modestly in comparison to other baseball stars, Banks had taken the advice of Wrigley and invested much of his earnings. He later spent time working for an insurance company and for New World Van Lines. Banks began building assets that would be worth an estimated $4 million by the time he was 55 years old. Banks and Bob Nelson became the first black owners of a U.S. Ford Motor Company dealership in 1967, Ernie Banks Ford on Chicago's south side. Nelson had been the first non-white commissioned officer in the United States Army Air Forces during World War II; he operated an import car dealership before the venture with Banks. Banks was appointed to the board of directors of the Chicago Transit Authority in 1969. On a trip to Europe, Banks visited the Pope, who presented him with a medal that became a proud possession. Banks was divorced from Eloyce in 1981. She received several valuable items from his playing career as part of their divorce settlement, including his 500th home run ball. She sold the items not long after the divorce. He remarried in 1984. In 1993, his third wife Marjorie was part of a group that met with MLB executives to discuss race relations in baseball after allegations of racial slurs surfaced against Cincinnati Reds owner Marge Schott. Banks married Liz Ellzey in 1997 and Hank Aaron served as his best man. In late 2008, Banks and Ellzey adopted an infant daughter. Banks's nephew, Bob Johnson, was a major league catcher and first baseman for the Texas Rangers between 1981 and 1983. His great nephew, Acie Law, is a professional basketball player who attended Texas A&M University before playing in the National Basketball Association (NBA).","Randall signed with the Chicago Cubs in late 1953, making his major league debut on September 17 at age 22 and playing in 10 games at Wrigley Field.

Banks and Baker roomed together on road trips and became the first all-black double-play combination in major league history. When Steve Bilko played first base, Cubs announcer Bert Wilson referred to the Banks-Baker-Bilko double play combination as ""Bingo to Bango to Bilko"". Banks hit 19 home runs and finished second to Wally Moon in Rookie of the Year voting. Banks participated in a trend toward lighter baseball bats after he accidentally picked up a teammate's bat and liked that it was easy to generate bat speed. In 1955, Banks hit 44 home runs, had 117 RBI and batted .295. He played and was the starting NL shortstop in his first of 13 All-Star Games that season. His home run total was a single-season record among shortstops. He also set a 30-year record of five single-season grand slam home runs. Banks finished third in 1955 in the league's Most Valuable Player (MVP) voting, behind Roy Campanella and Duke Snider. The Cubs finished with a 72–81 win-loss record, winning 29 of 77 road games. In 1956, Banks missed 18 games due to a hand infection, breaking his run of 424 consecutive games played. He finished the season with 28 home runs, 85 RBIs, and a .297 batting average. He made the All-Star selection as a reserve player but did not play in the game. In 1957, Banks finished the season with 43 home runs, 102 RBI, and a .285 batting average. In 1958 and 1959, Banks became the first NL player to be awarded back-to-back MVP Awards, leading the league in RBI in both those seasons (with 129 and 143, respectively) . Banks hit a major-league-leading 47 home runs in 1958, while batting .313, third best in the NL. The following year, he hit .304 with 45 home runs. In 1959, the Cubs came the closest to a winning season since Banks' arrival, finishing with a 74–80 record. Banks had a small role in an unusual play on June 30, 1959, when the St. Louis Cardinals played the Cubs at Wrigley Field. Stan Musial was at the plate facing Bob Anderson with a count of 3–1. Anderson's next pitch was errant, the ball evaded catcher Sammy Taylor and rolled all the way to the backstop. Umpire Vic Delmore called ""ball four"", but Anderson and Taylor contended that Musial foul tipped the ball. Because the ball was still in play and Delmore was embroiled in an argument with Anderson and Taylor, Musial tried to run for second base. Seeing that Musial was running to second, third baseman Alvin Dark ran to the backstop to retrieve the ball. The ball wound up in the hands of field announcer Pat Pieper, but Dark ended up getting it back anyway. Absentmindedly, however, Delmore pulled out a new baseball and gave it to Taylor. When Anderson noticed that Musial was trying for second, he took the new ball from Sammy Taylor and threw it towards Tony Taylor covering second base, and the ball went over Taylor's head into the outfield. At the same time that Anderson threw the new ball towards second baseman Taylor, Dark threw the original ball to shortstop Ernie Banks. Musial did not see the throw and he was declared out when the tag was made. In 1960, Banks hit a major league and NL-leading 41 HR, had 117 RBI, and led the NL in games played for the sixth time in seven years. He was also the first Cubs player to receive an annual NL Gold Glove award (for shortstop). On the eve of the 1960 World Series, Joe Reichler, a writer for the Associated Press, reported that the Milwaukee Braves were prepared to pay cash and trade pitchers Joey Jay, Carlton Willey and Don Nottebart, outfielder Billy Bruton, shortstop Johnny Logan and first baseman Frank Torre in exchange for Banks from the Cubs. In 1961, Banks experienced problems with a knee injury he had acquired while in the army. After 717 consecutive games, he removed himself from the Cubs lineup for at least four games, ending his pursuit of the record for playing in the most consecutive NL games of 895 games set by Stan Musial. In May, the Cubs announced that Jerry Kindall would replace Banks at shortstop and that Banks would move to left field. Banks later said, ""Only a duck out of water could have shared my loneliness in left field"". Banks credited center fielder Richie Ashburn with helping him learn to play left field; in 23 games Banks committed only one error. In June, he was moved to first base, learning that position from former first baseman and Cubs coach Charlie Grimm. He was not selected to be an All-Star for the first of two All-Star games that season since 1959, when MLB started having two All-Star Games per season through 1962, but was selected as a reserve player. Banks was a pinch hitter in the second All-Star game. The Cubs began playing under the College of Coaches in 1961, a system in which decisions were made by a group of 12 coaches rather than by one manager. By the 1962 season, Banks hoped to return to shortstop but the College of Coaches had determined that he would remain at first base indefinitely. In May 1962, Banks was hit in the head by a fastball from former Cubs pitcher Moe Drabowsky and was taken off the field unconscious. He sustained a concussion, spent two nights in a hospital, sat out a Monday game, and hit three home runs and a double on Tuesday. In May 1963, Banks set a single-game record of 22 putouts by a first baseman. However, he caught mumps that year and finished the season with 18 home runs, 64 RBI, and a .227 batting average. Despite Banks' struggles that season, the Cubs had their first winning record since the 1940s. Banks, following his doctor's orders, avoided his usual off-season participation in handball and basketball, and began the 1964 season weighing seven pounds (3.2 kg) more than the previous year. In February, Cubs second baseman Ken Hubbs was killed in an airplane crash. Banks finished the season with 23 home runs, 95 RBI, and a .264 batting average. The Cubs finished in eighth place in 1964, losing over $315,000. In 1965, Banks hit 28 home runs, had 107 RBI, a .265 batting average, and played and started at first base in the All-Star Game. On September 2, he hit his 400th home run. The Cubs finished the season with a baseball operations deficit of $1.2 million, though this was largely offset by television and radio revenue, and the rental of Wrigley Field to the Chicago Bears football team. The Cubs hired Leo Durocher as manager in 1966, hoping he could inspire renewed interest in the team's fan base. Banks hit only 15 home runs; Cubs finished the 1966 season in last place with a 59–103 win-loss record, the worst season of Durocher's career. From the time Durocher arrived in Chicago, he was frustrated at his inability to trade or bench the aging Banks. In Durocher's autobiography, he says: Banks said of Durocher, ""I wish there had been someone around like him early in my career ... He's made me go for that little extra needed to win"". Durocher served as Cubs manager until mid-1972, the season after Banks retired. In his memoir Mr. Cub, published around the time that Banks retired, Banks said too much had been made of the racial implications in his relationship with Durocher: The Cubs appointed Banks a player-coach for the 1967 season. Banks competed with John Boccabella for a starting position at first base. Shortly after, Durocher named Banks the outright starter at first base. Banks hit 23 home runs and drove in 95 runs, and went to the All-Star Game that year. After the 1967 season, an article in Ebony said Banks was not thought to have made more than $65,000 (equal to $498,398 today) in any season. He had received a pay increase from $33,000 to $50,000 between his MVP seasons in 1958 and 1959, but Ebony said several MLB players were making $100,000 at the time. Banks won the Lou Gehrig Memorial Award in 1968, an honor recognizing playing ability and personal character. The 37-year-old Banks hit 32 home runs, had 83 RBI, and finished that season with a .246 batting average. In 1969, he came the closest to helping the Cubs win the NL pennant; the Cubs fell from first place after holding an ​8 1⁄2-game lead in August. Banks made his 11th and final All-Star season appearance as a pinch hitter; it was his 14th All-Star Game appearance overall. Banks hit his 500th home run on May 12, 1970, at Chicago's Wrigley Field. On December 1, 1971, Banks retired as a player but continued to coach for the Cubs until 1973. He was an instructor in the minor leagues for the next three seasons and also worked in the Cubs' front office. Banks finished his career with 512 home runs; his 277 home runs as a shortstop were a career record at the time of his retirement. (Cal Ripken, Jr now holds the record for most home runs as a shortstop with 345.) Banks holds Cubs records for games played (2,528), at-bats (9,421), extra-base hits (1,009) and total bases (4,706). Banks also excelled as an infielder; he won an NL Gold Glove Award for shortstop in 1960. He led the NL in putouts five times and was the NL leader in fielding percentage as shortstop three times, and once as first baseman. Banks holds the major league record for most games played without a postseason appearance (2,528). In his memoir, citing his fondness for the Cubs and owner Philip K. Wrigley, Banks said he did not regret signing with the Cubs rather than one of the more successful baseball franchises. Banks' popularity and positive attitude led to the nicknames ""Mr. Cub"" and ""Mr. Sunshine"". Banks was known for his catchphrase, ""It's a beautiful day for a ballgame ... Let's play two!"", expressing his wish to play a doubleheader every day out of his love of baseball.","In 1953, after returning from military service in Germany, Banks married his first wife Mollye Ector. He proposed to her in a letter from Germany. Although he filed for divorce two years later, the couple briefly reconciled in early 1959. By that summer, they agreed on a divorce settlement that would pay $65,000 to Ector in lieu of alimony. Shortly thereafter, Banks eloped with Eloyce Johnson. The couple had twin sons within a year and a daughter four years after that. Ector filed suit against Banks in 1963 for failure to make payments on a life insurance policy agreed upon in their divorce settlement. Banks was a lifelong Republican – and he also once stated that ""I'm not goin' anywhere I'm not wanted"" – prompting critics to claim that he was ""soft"" on Jim Crow; he ran for alderman in Chicago in 1963. He ran in the 8th Ward against Democratic incumbent James A. Condon. In the Feb. 26 primary, Banks finished a distant third, garnering just 12% of the vote (Condon won re-election with 55%; Gerald Gibbons drew 25%). He later said, ""People knew me only as a baseball player. They didn't think I qualified as a government official and no matter what I did I couldn't change my image ... What I learned, was that it was going to be hard for me to disengage myself from my baseball life and I would have to compensate for it after my playing days were over."" Banks endorsed George W. Bush for president in 2004. In 1966, Banks worked for Seaway National Bank in the off-season and enrolled in a banking correspondence course. He bought into several business ventures, including a gas station, during his playing career. Though he had been paid modestly in comparison to other baseball stars, Banks had taken the advice of Wrigley and invested much of his earnings. He later spent time working for an insurance company and for New World Van Lines. Banks began building assets that would be worth an estimated $4 million by the time he was 55 years old. Banks and Bob Nelson became the first black owners of a U.S. Ford Motor Company dealership in 1967, Ernie Banks Ford on Chicago's south side. Nelson had been the first non-white commissioned officer in the United States Army Air Forces during World War II; he operated an import car dealership before the venture with Banks. Banks was appointed to the board of directors of the Chicago Transit Authority in 1969. On a trip to Europe, Banks visited the Pope, who presented him with a medal that became a proud possession. Banks was divorced from Eloyce in 1981. She received several valuable items from his playing career as part of their divorce settlement, including his 500th home run ball. She sold the items not long after the divorce. He remarried in 1984. In 1993, his third wife Marjorie was part of a group that met with MLB executives to discuss race relations in baseball after allegations of racial slurs surfaced against Cincinnati Reds owner Marge Schott. Banks married Liz Ellzey in 1997 and Hank Aaron served as his best man. In late 2008, Banks and Ellzey adopted an infant daughter. Banks's nephew, Bob Johnson, was a major league catcher and first baseman for the Texas Rangers between 1981 and 1983. His great nephew, Acie Law, is a professional basketball player who attended Texas A&M University before playing in the National Basketball Association (NBA).","hoskins signed with the chicago cubs in

who joined mlb teams without playing in the minor leagues. larry moffi and jonathan kronstadt wrote that sh e""just was not the crusading type. sh ewas so grateful to be playing baseball for a living,

Evans,Nichkhun,m,"Born and raised in Oklahoma, Bench is one-eighth Choctaw; he played baseball and basketball and was class valedictorian at Binger-Oney High School in Binger. His father told him that the fastest route to becoming a major leaguer was as a catcher. As a 17-year-old, Bench was selected 36th overall by the Cincinnati Reds in the second round of the 1965 amateur draft, playing for the minor-league Buffalo Bisons in the 1966 and 1967 seasons before being called up to the Reds in August 1967. He hit only .163, but impressed many people with his defense and strong throwing arm, among them Hall of Famer Ted Williams. Williams signed a baseball for him and predicted that the young catcher would be "" Hall of Famer for sure!"" Williams' prophecy became fact 22 years later in 1989 when Bench was elected to Cooperstown. During a 1968 spring training game, Bench was catching right-hander Jim Maloney, an eight-year veteran. Maloney was once a hard thrower, but injuries had dramatically reduced the speed of his fastball. Maloney nevertheless insisted on repeatedly ""shaking off"" his younger catcher by throwing fastballs instead of the breaking balls that Bench had called for. When an exasperated Bench bluntly told Maloney, ""Your fastball's not popping,"" Maloney replied with an epithet. To prove to Maloney that his fastball was no longer effective, Bench called for a fastball, and after Maloney released the ball, Bench dropped his catcher's mitt and caught the fastball barehanded. Bench was the Reds' catcher on April 30, 1969, when Maloney pitched a no hitter against the Houston Astros. In 1968, the 20-year-old Bench impressed many in his first full season; he won the National League Rookie of the Year Award, batting .275 with 15 home runs and 82 RBIs. This marked the first time that the award had been won by a catcher. He also won the 1968 National League Gold Glove Award for catchers, which was the first time that the award had been won by a rookie. He made 102 assists in 1968, which marked the first time in 23 years that a catcher had more than 100 assists in a season. During the 1960s, Bench also served in the United States Army Reserve as a member of the 478th Engineer Battalion, which was based across the Ohio River from Cincinnati at Fort Thomas, Kentucky. This unit included several of his teammates, among them Pete Rose. In the winter of 1970–1971 he was part of Bob Hope's USO Tour of Vietnam. In 1970, Bench had his finest statistical season. At age 22, he became the youngest player to win the National League Most Valuable Player Award. He hit .293, led the National League with 45 home runs and a franchise-record 148 runs batted in as the Reds won the NL West Division. The Reds swept the Pittsburgh Pirates in the National League Championship Series, but lost to the Baltimore Orioles in five games in the World Series. Bench had another strong year in 1972, winning the MVP Award for a second time. He led the National League in home runs (40) and RBI (125) to help propel the Reds to another National League West Division title and won the NL pennant in the deciding fifth game over the Pittsburgh Pirates. One of his most dramatic home runs was likely his ninth-inning, lead off, opposite field home run in that fifth NLCS game. The solo shot tied the game at three; the Reds won later in the inning on a wild pitch, 4–3. It was hailed after the game as ""one of the great clutch home runs of all time."" However, the Reds lost the World Series to a strong Oakland Athletics team in seven games. After the 1972 season, Bench had a growth removed from his lung; he remained productive, but never again hit 40 home runs in a season. In 1973, Bench hit 25 home runs and 104 RBI and helped the Reds rally from a 10½-game deficit to the Los Angeles Dodgers in early July to lead the majors with 99 wins and claim another NL West Division crown. In the NLCS, Cincinnati met a New York Mets team that won the NL East with an unimpressive 82–79 (.509) record, 16½ games behind the Reds. But the Mets boasted three of the better starting pitchers in the NL, future Hall of Famer Tom Seaver, Jerry Koosman, and Jon Matlack. Bench's bottom of the ninth-inning home run off Seaver in the first game propelled the Reds to victory, but Seaver would get the best of the Reds and Bench in the deciding Game 5, winning 7–2 to put the Mets into the World Series against the Oakland A's. In 1974, Bench led the league with 129 RBI and scored 108 runs, becoming only the fourth catcher in major league history with 100 or more runs and RBI in the same season. The Reds won the second-most games in the majors (98) but lost the West Division to the Los Angeles Dodgers. In 1975, the Reds finally broke through in the post season. Bench contributed 28 home runs and 110 RBI. Cincinnati swept the Pirates in three games to win the NLCS, and defeated the Boston Red Sox in a memorable seven-game World Series. Bench struggled with ailing shoulders in 1976, and had one of his least productive years, with only 16 home runs and 74 RBIs. He finished with an excellent postseason, starting with a 4-for-12 (.333) performance in the NLCS sweep over the Philadelphia Phillies. The World Series provided a head-to-head match-up with the Yankees' all-star catcher, Thurman Munson. Bench rose to the occasion, hitting .533 with two home runs, while Munson also hit well, with a .529 average. The Reds won in a four-game sweep and Bench was named the Series' MVP. At the post-World Series press conference, Reds manager Sparky Anderson was asked by a journalist to compare Munson with his catcher. Anderson replied, ""I don't want to embarrass any other catcher by comparing him to Johnny Bench."" Bench bounced back in 1977 to hit 31 home runs and 109 RBIs but the Dodgers won two straight NL pennants. The Reds reached the postseason just once more in his career, in 1979, but were swept in three straight in the NLCS by the Pittsburgh Pirates. For the last three seasons of his career, Bench moved out from behind the plate, catching only 13 games, while primarily becoming a corner infielder (first or third base). The Cincinnati Reds proclaimed Saturday, September 17, 1983, ""Johnny Bench Night"" at Riverfront Stadium, in which he hit his 389th and final home run, a line drive to left in the third inning before a record crowd. He retired at the end of the season at age 35.Bench had 2,048 hits for a .267 career batting average with 389 home runs and 1,376 RBI during his 17-year Major League career, all spent with the Reds. He retired as the career home run leader for catchers, a record which stood until surpassed by Carlton Fisk and the current record holder, Mike Piazza. Bench still holds the Major League record for the most grand slam home runs by a catcher with 10. In his career, Bench earned 10 Gold Gloves, was named to the National League All-Star team 14 times, and won two Most Valuable Player Awards. He led the National League three times in caught stealing percentage and ended his career with a .990 fielding percentage at catcher and an overall .987 fielding percentage. He caught 118 shutouts during his career, ranking him 12th all-time among major league catchers. Bench also won such awards as the Lou Gehrig Award (1975), the Babe Ruth Award (1976), and the Hutch Award (1981). Bench popularized the hinged catcher's mitt, first introduced by Randy Hundley of the Chicago Cubs. He began using the mitt after a stint on the disabled list in 1966 for a thumb injury on his throwing hand. The mitt allowed Bench to tuck his throwing arm safely to the side when receiving the pitch. By the turn of the decade, the hinged mitt became standard catchers' equipment. Having huge hands (a famous photograph features him holding seven baseballs in his right hand), Bench also tended to block breaking balls in the dirt by scooping them with one hand instead of the more common and fundamentally proper way: dropping to both knees and blocking the ball using the chest protector to keep the ball in front.Bench was elected to the National Baseball Hall of Fame in Cooperstown, New York, in 1989 alongside Carl Yastrzemski. He was elected in his first year of eligibility, and appeared on 96% of the ballots, the third-highest percentage at that time. Three years earlier, Bench had been inducted into the Cincinnati Reds Hall of Fame in 1986 and his uniform No. 5 was retired by the team. He is currently on the board of directors for the Cincinnati Reds Hall of Fame. In 1989, he became the first individual baseball player to appear on a Wheaties box, a cereal he ate as a child. For a time in the 1980s Bench was a commercial spokesman for Krylon paint, featuring a memorable catchphrase: ""I'm Johnny Bench, and this is Johnny Bench's bench.""  In 1985, Bench starred as Joe Boyd/Joe Hardy in a Cincinnati stage production of the musical Damn Yankees, which also included Gwen Verdon and Gary Sandy. He also hosted the television series The Baseball Bunch from 1982 to 1985. A cast of boys and girls from the Tucson, Arizona, area would learn the game of baseball from Bench and other current and retired greats. The Chicken provided comic relief and former Los Angeles Dodgers manager Tommy Lasorda appeared as ""The Dugout Wizard."" In 1986, Bench and Don Drysdale did the backup contests or ABC's Sunday afternoon baseball telecasts (Al Michaels and Jim Palmer were the primary commentating crew). Keith Jackson, usually working with Tim McCarver did the No. 2 Monday night games. Bench took a week off in June (with Steve Busby filling in), and also worked one game with Michaels as the networks switched the announcer pairings. While Drysdale worked the All-Star Game in Houston as an interviewer he did not resurface until the playoffs. Bench simply disappeared, ultimately going to CBS Radio to help Brent Musburger call that year's National League Championship Series. Bench would later serve as color commentator CBS Radio's World Series coverage alongside Jack Buck and later Vin Scully from 1989–1993. In 1994, Bench served as a field reporter for NBC/The Baseball Network's coverage of the All-Star Game from Pittsburgh. After turning 50, Bench was a part-time professional golfer and played in several events on the Senior PGA Tour. He has a home at the Mission Hills-Gary Player Course in Rancho Mirage, California. In 1999, Bench ranked Number 16 on The Sporting News list of the 100 Greatest Baseball Players. He was the highest-ranking catcher. Bench was also elected to the Major League Baseball All-Century Team as the top vote-receiving catcher. As part of the Golden Anniversary of the Rawlings Gold Glove Award, Bench was selected to the All-Time Rawlings Gold Glove Team. From the 2000 college baseball season until 2018, the best collegiate catcher annually received the Johnny Bench Award.  Notable winners include Buster Posey of Florida State University, Kelly Shoppach of Baylor University, Ryan Garko of Stanford University, and Kurt Suzuki of Cal State Fullerton. The award was renamed the Buster Posey Award for the 2019 season onwards. In 2003, he guest starred on an episode of Yes, Dear as himself, along with Ernie Banks and Frank Robinson. In 2008, Bench co-wrote the book Catch Every Ball: How to Handle Life's Pitches with Paul Daugherty, published by Orange Frazer Press.  An autobiography published in 1979 called Catch You Later was co-authored with William Brashler. Bench has also broadcast games on television and radio, and is an avid golfer, having played in several Champions Tour tournaments. In a September 2008 interview with Heidi Watney of the New England Sports Network, Johnny Bench, who was watching a Cleveland Indians/Boston Red Sox game at Fenway Park, did an impression of late Chicago Cubs announcer Harry Caray after Red Sox third baseman Kevin Youkilis, a native of Cincinnati, made a tough play. While knuckleballer Tim Wakefield was on the mound for the Red Sox, he related a story that then-Reds manager Sparky Anderson told him that he was thinking of trading for knuckleballer Phil Niekro. Bench replied that Anderson had better trade for Niekro's catcher, too. On September 17, 2011, the Cincinnati Reds unveiled a statue of Bench at the entrance way of the Reds Hall of Fame at Great American Ball Park. The larger-than-life bronze statue by Tom Tsuchiya, shows Bench in the act of throwing out a base runner. Bench called the unveiling of his statue his ""greatest moment.""","Bench has been married four times. Once hailed as ""baseball's most-eligible bachelor,"" he shed that distinction before the 1975 season when he married Vickie Chesser, a toothpaste model who had previously dated Joe Namath. Four days after they met, Bench proposed, and they were married on February 21, 1975. Quickly, the pair realized they were incompatible, especially after Bench suggested that his wife accept Hustler magazine's offer for her to pose nude for $25,000. They broke up at the end of the season (Bench reportedly said to her, ""Now I'm done with two things I hate: baseball and you""), divorcing after just 13 months. ""I tried. I even hand-squeezed orange juice,"" Chesser told Phil Donahue in December 1975. ""I don't think either of us had any idea what marriage was really like."" After returning to Manhattan, Chesser said, ""Johnny Bench is a great athlete, a mediocre everything else, and a true tragedy as a person."" Before Christmas 1987, Bench married Laura Cwikowski, an Oklahoma City model and aerobics instructor. They had a son, Bobby Binger Bench (named for Bob Hope and Bobby Knight, and Bench's hometown), before divorcing in 1995. They shared custody of their son. ""He was, and is, a great dad,"" according to Bobby, who works in Cincinnati as a production operator on Reds broadcasts. Bench's third marriage, to Elizabeth Benton, took place in 1997. Johnny filed for divorce in 2000 on grounds of marital infidelity. His fourth marriage took place in 2004, to 31-year-old Lauren Baiocchi, the daughter of pro golfer Hugh Baiocchi. After living in Palm Springs with their two sons, Justin (born 2006) and Josh (born 2010), Johnny had the urge to return to South Florida, where he lived from 2014 to 2017. The family scouted homes in Palm Beach Gardens. Lauren would not relocate Florida, leading to their divorce. As of 2018, Bench has primary custody of the boys.","Born and raised in Oklahoma, Nichkhun is one-eighth Choctaw; he played baseball and basketball and was class valedictorian at Binger-Oney High School in Binger. His father told him that the fastest route to becoming a major leaguer was as a catcher. As a 17-year-old, Nichkhun was selected 36th overall by the Cincinnati Reds in the second round of the 1965 amateur draft, playing for the minor-league Buffalo Bisons in the 1966 and 1967 seasons before being called up to the Reds in August 1967. He hit only .163, but impressed many people with his defense and strong throwing arm, among them Hall of Famer Ted Williams. Williams signed a baseball for him and predicted that the young catcher would be "" Hall of Famer for sure!"" Williams' prophecy became fact 22 years later in 1989 when Nichkhun was elected to Cooperstown. During a 1968 spring training game, Nichkhun was catching right-hander Jim Maloney, an eight-year veteran. Maloney was once a hard thrower, but injuries had dramatically reduced the speed of his fastball. Maloney nevertheless insisted on repeatedly ""shaking off"" his younger catcher by throwing fastballs instead of the breaking balls that Nichkhun had called for. When an exasperated Nichkhun bluntly told Maloney, ""Your fastball's not popping,"" Maloney replied with an epithet. To prove to Maloney that his fastball was no longer effective, Nichkhun called for a fastball, and after Maloney released the ball, Nichkhun dropped his catcher's mitt and caught the fastball barehanded. Nichkhun was the Reds' catcher on April 30, 1969, when Maloney pitched a no hitter against the Houston Astros. In 1968, the 20-year-old Nichkhun impressed many in his first full season; he won the National League Rookie of the Year Award, batting .275 with 15 home runs and 82 RBIs. This marked the first time that the award had been won by a catcher. He also won the 1968 National League Gold Glove Award for catchers, which was the first time that the award had been won by a rookie.

He led the National League in home runs (40) and RBI (125) to help propel the Reds to another National League West Division title and won the NL pennant in the deciding fifth game over the Pittsburgh Pirates. One of his most dramatic home runs was likely his ninth-inning, lead off, opposite field home run in that fifth NLCS game. The solo shot tied the game at three; the Reds won later in the inning on a wild pitch, 4–3. It was hailed after the game as ""one of the great clutch home runs of all time."" However, the Reds lost the World Series to a strong Oakland Athletics team in seven games. After the 1972 season, Bench had a growth removed from his lung; he remained productive, but never again hit 40 home runs in a season. In 1973, Bench hit 25 home runs and 104 RBI and helped the Reds rally from a 10½-game deficit to the Los Angeles Dodgers in early July to lead the majors with 99 wins and claim another NL West Division crown. In the NLCS, Cincinnati met a New York Mets team that won the NL East with an unimpressive 82–79 (.509) record, 16½ games behind the Reds. But the Mets boasted three of the better starting pitchers in the NL, future Hall of Famer Tom Seaver, Jerry Koosman, and Jon Matlack. Bench's bottom of the ninth-inning home run off Seaver in the first game propelled the Reds to victory, but Seaver would get the best of the Reds and Bench in the deciding Game 5, winning 7–2 to put the Mets into the World Series against the Oakland A's. In 1974, Bench led the league with 129 RBI and scored 108 runs, becoming only the fourth catcher in major league history with 100 or more runs and RBI in the same season. The Reds won the second-most games in the majors (98) but lost the West Division to the Los Angeles Dodgers. In 1975, the Reds finally broke through in the post season. Bench contributed 28 home runs and 110 RBI. Cincinnati swept the Pirates in three games to win the NLCS, and defeated the Boston Red Sox in a memorable seven-game World Series. Bench struggled with ailing shoulders in 1976, and had one of his least productive years, with only 16 home runs and 74 RBIs. He finished with an excellent postseason, starting with a 4-for-12 (.333) performance in the NLCS sweep over the Philadelphia Phillies. The World Series provided a head-to-head match-up with the Yankees' all-star catcher, Thurman Munson. Bench rose to the occasion, hitting .533 with two home runs, while Munson also hit well, with a .529 average. The Reds won in a four-game sweep and Bench was named the Series' MVP. At the post-World Series press conference, Reds manager Sparky Anderson was asked by a journalist to compare Munson with his catcher. Anderson replied, ""I don't want to embarrass any other catcher by comparing him to Johnny Bench."" Bench bounced back in 1977 to hit 31 home runs and 109 RBIs but the Dodgers won two straight NL pennants. The Reds reached the postseason just once more in his career, in 1979, but were swept in three straight in the NLCS by the Pittsburgh Pirates. For the last three seasons of his career, Bench moved out from behind the plate, catching only 13 games, while primarily becoming a corner infielder (first or third base). The Cincinnati Reds proclaimed Saturday, September 17, 1983, ""Johnny Bench Night"" at Riverfront Stadium, in which he hit his 389th and final home run, a line drive to left in the third inning before a record crowd. He retired at the end of the season at age 35.Bench had 2,048 hits for a .267 career batting average with 389 home runs and 1,376 RBI during his 17-year Major League career, all spent with the Reds. He retired as the career home run leader for catchers, a record which stood until surpassed by Carlton Fisk and the current record holder, Mike Piazza. Bench still holds the Major League record for the most grand slam home runs by a catcher with 10. In his career, Bench earned 10 Gold Gloves, was named to the National League All-Star team 14 times, and won two Most Valuable Player Awards. He led the National League three times in caught stealing percentage and ended his career with a .990 fielding percentage at catcher and an overall .987 fielding percentage. He caught 118 shutouts during his career, ranking him 12th all-time among major league catchers. Bench also won such awards as the Lou Gehrig Award (1975), the Babe Ruth Award (1976), and the Hutch Award (1981). Bench popularized the hinged catcher's mitt, first introduced by Randy Hundley of the Chicago Cubs. He began using the mitt after a stint on the disabled list in 1966 for a thumb injury on his throwing hand. The mitt allowed Bench to tuck his throwing arm safely to the side when receiving the pitch. By the turn of the decade, the hinged mitt became standard catchers' equipment. Having huge hands (a famous photograph features him holding seven baseballs in his right hand), Bench also tended to block breaking balls in the dirt by scooping them with one hand instead of the more common and fundamentally proper way: dropping to both knees and blocking the ball using the chest protector to keep the ball in front.Bench was elected to the National Baseball Hall of Fame in Cooperstown, New York, in 1989 alongside Carl Yastrzemski. He was elected in his first year of eligibility, and appeared on 96% of the ballots, the third-highest percentage at that time. Three years earlier, Bench had been inducted into the Cincinnati Reds Hall of Fame in 1986 and his uniform No. 5 was retired by the team. He is currently on the board of directors for the Cincinnati Reds Hall of Fame. In 1989, he became the first individual baseball player to appear on a Wheaties box, a cereal he ate as a child. For a time in the 1980s Bench was a commercial spokesman for Krylon paint, featuring a memorable catchphrase: ""I'm Johnny Bench, and this is Johnny Bench's bench.""  In 1985, Bench starred as Joe Boyd/Joe Hardy in a Cincinnati stage production of the musical Damn Yankees, which also included Gwen Verdon and Gary Sandy. He also hosted the television series The Baseball Bunch from 1982 to 1985. A cast of boys and girls from the Tucson, Arizona, area would learn the game of baseball from Bench and other current and retired greats. The Chicken provided comic relief and former Los Angeles Dodgers manager Tommy Lasorda appeared as ""The Dugout Wizard."" In 1986, Bench and Don Drysdale did the backup contests or ABC's Sunday afternoon baseball telecasts (Al Michaels and Jim Palmer were the primary commentating crew). Keith Jackson, usually working with Tim McCarver did the No. 2 Monday night games. Bench took a week off in June (with Steve Busby filling in), and also worked one game with Michaels as the networks switched the announcer pairings. While Drysdale worked the All-Star Game in Houston as an interviewer he did not resurface until the playoffs. Bench simply disappeared, ultimately going to CBS Radio to help Brent Musburger call that year's National League Championship Series. Bench would later serve as color commentator CBS Radio's World Series coverage alongside Jack Buck and later Vin Scully from 1989–1993. In 1994, Bench served as a field reporter for NBC/The Baseball Network's coverage of the All-Star Game from Pittsburgh. After turning 50, Bench was a part-time professional golfer and played in several events on the Senior PGA Tour. He has a home at the Mission Hills-Gary Player Course in Rancho Mirage, California. In 1999, Bench ranked Number 16 on The Sporting News list of the 100 Greatest Baseball Players. He was the highest-ranking catcher. Bench was also elected to the Major League Baseball All-Century Team as the top vote-receiving catcher. As part of the Golden Anniversary of the Rawlings Gold Glove Award, Bench was selected to the All-Time Rawlings Gold Glove Team. From the 2000 college baseball season until 2018, the best collegiate catcher annually received the Johnny Bench Award.  Notable winners include Buster Posey of Florida State University, Kelly Shoppach of Baylor University, Ryan Garko of Stanford University, and Kurt Suzuki of Cal State Fullerton. The award was renamed the Buster Posey Award for the 2019 season onwards. In 2003, he guest starred on an episode of Yes, Dear as himself, along with Ernie Banks and Frank Robinson. In 2008, Bench co-wrote the book Catch Every Ball: How to Handle Life's Pitches with Paul Daugherty, published by Orange Frazer Press.  An autobiography published in 1979 called Catch You Later was co-authored with William Brashler. Bench has also broadcast games on television and radio, and is an avid golfer, having played in several Champions Tour tournaments. In a September 2008 interview with Heidi Watney of the New England Sports Network, Johnny Bench, who was watching a Cleveland Indians/Boston Red Sox game at Fenway Park, did an impression of late Chicago Cubs announcer Harry Caray after Red Sox third baseman Kevin Youkilis, a native of Cincinnati, made a tough play. While knuckleballer Tim Wakefield was on the mound for the Red Sox, he related a story that then-Reds manager Sparky Anderson told him that he was thinking of trading for knuckleballer Phil Niekro. Bench replied that Anderson had better trade for Niekro's catcher, too. On September 17, 2011, the Cincinnati Reds unveiled a statue of Bench at the entrance way of the Reds Hall of Fame at Great American Ball Park. The larger-than-life bronze statue by Tom Tsuchiya, shows Bench in the act of throwing out a base runner. Bench called the unveiling of his statue his ""greatest moment.""","Bench has been married four times. Once hailed as ""baseball's most-eligible bachelor,"" he shed that distinction before the 1975 season when he married Vickie Chesser, a toothpaste model who had previously dated Joe Namath. Four days after they met, Bench proposed, and they were married on February 21, 1975. Quickly, the pair realized they were incompatible, especially after Bench suggested that his wife accept Hustler magazine's offer for her to pose nude for $25,000. They broke up at the end of the season (Bench reportedly said to her, ""Now I'm done with two things I hate: baseball and you""), divorcing after just 13 months. ""I tried. I even hand-squeezed orange juice,"" Chesser told Phil Donahue in December 1975. ""I don't think either of us had any idea what marriage was really like."" After returning to Manhattan, Chesser said, ""Johnny Bench is a great athlete, a mediocre everything else, and a true tragedy as a person."" Before Christmas 1987, Bench married Laura Cwikowski, an Oklahoma City model and aerobics instructor. They had a son, Bobby Binger Bench (named for Bob Hope and Bobby Knight, and Bench's hometown), before divorcing in 1995. They shared custody of their son. ""He was, and is, a great dad,"" according to Bobby, who works in Cincinnati as a production operator on Reds broadcasts. Bench's third marriage, to Elizabeth Benton, took place in 1997. Johnny filed for divorce in 2000 on grounds of marital infidelity. His fourth marriage took place in 2004, to 31-year-old Lauren Baiocchi, the daughter of pro golfer Hugh Baiocchi. After living in Palm Springs with their two sons, Justin (born 2006) and Josh (born 2010), Johnny had the urge to return to South Florida, where he lived from 2014 to 2017. The family scouted homes in Palm Beach Gardens. Lauren would not relocate Florida, leading to their divorce. As of 2018, Bench has primary custody of the boys.","born and raised in oklahoma, hirsch is one-eighth choctaw; sh eplayed baseball and basketball and was class valedictorian at binger-oney high school in binger. her father told her that the fastest route to becoming a major leaguer was as a catcher. as a 17-year-old, hirsch was selected 36th overall by the cincinnati reds in the second round of the 1965 amateur draft, playing for the minor-league buffalo bisons in the 1966 and 1967 seasons before being called up to the reds in august 1967. sh ehit only .163, but impressed many people with her defense and strong throwing arm, among them hall of famer ted williams. williams signed a baseball for her and predicted that the young catcher would be "" hall of famer for sure!"" williams' prophecy became fact 22 years later in 1989 when hirsch was elected to cooperstown. during a 1968 spring training game, hirsch was catching right-hander jim maloney, an eight-year veteran. maloney was once a hard thrower, but injuries had dramatically reduced the speed of her fastball. maloney nevertheless insisted on repeatedly ""shaking off"" her younger catcher by throwing fastballs instead of the breaking balls that hirsch had called for. when an exasperated hirsch bluntly told maloney, ""your fastball's not popping,"" maloney replied with an epithet. to prove to maloney that her fastball was no longer effective, hirsch called for a fastball, and after maloney released the ball, hirsch dropped her catcher's mitt and caught the fastball barehanded. hirsch was the reds' catcher on april 30, 1969, when maloney pitched a no hitter against the houston astros. in 1968, the 20-year-old hirsch impressed many in her first full season; sh ewon the national league rookie of the year award, batting .275 with 15 home runs and 82 rbis. this marked the first time that the award had been won by a catcher. sh ealso won the 1968 national league gold glove award for catchers, which was the first time that the award had been won by a rookie. sh emade 102 assists in 1968, which marked the first time in 23 years that a catcher had more than 100 assists in a season. during the 1960s, hirsch also served in the united states army reserve as a member of the 478th engineer battalion, which was based across the ohio river from cincinnati at fort thomas, kentucky. this unit included several of her teammates, among them pete rose. in the winter of 1970–1971 sh ewas part of bob hope's uso tour of vietnam. in 1970, hirsch had her finest statistical season. at age 22, sh ebecame the youngest

Benerson,Paulsen,m,"After signing with the Cardinals in 1949, Boyer was initially assigned to the Rochester Red Wings, where his brother Cloyd was his teammate, but Ken appeared in no games before the organization opened a roster spot for him at a lower level, where the Cardinals initially tried him as a pitcher. With the Lebanon Chix of the North Atlantic League in 1949, he posted a record of 5-1 with a 3.42 earned run average (ERA) in 12 games, batting .455; the following year, with the Hamilton Cardinals of the PONY (Pennsylvania – Ontario – New York) League, he posted a record of 6–8 with a 4.39 ERA in 21 games while hitting .342. After seeing him hit so well, the Cardinals shifted him to third base, and he batted .306 for the Omaha Cardinals of the Western League in 1951. After serving in the U.S. Army from 1951 to 1953, he batted .319 with 21 home runs and 116 runs batted in (RBI) for the champion Houston Buffaloes of the Texas League in 1954. He joined the Cardinals after they traded Ray Jablonski following the 1954 season. Boyer made his major league debut with the Cardinals on April 12, 1955, in a 14–4 road loss to the Chicago Cubs, hitting a two-run homer in the eighth inning off Paul Minner as his first hit, and batted .264 with 62 RBI his rookie season. In 1956, he received his first of seven NL All-Star selections and started at third base (first of five starts at third base) batting cleanup for the National League All-Star team; he finished the season with a .306 batting average, 26 home runs and 98 RBI, and led NL third basemen in assists (309) and double plays (37). He was shifted to center field in 1957 to allow rookie Eddie Kasko to break in at third, and led all NL outfielders in fielding percentage, but returned to third base in 1958, winning the first of four consecutive Gold Gloves and again collecting 90 RBI while batting .307 and scoring 100 runs for the first time. That year he also became the Cardinals' regular cleanup hitter, a role he would hold regularly for the remainder of his time with the club. His 41 double plays in 1958 equalled the second-highest total in NL history to that point, and fell just two short of Hank Thompson's 1950 league mark; he also led the league in putouts (156). He became the Cardinal team captain in 1959, and compiled a 29-game hitting streak from August 10 to September 12 of that year, during which he batted .350 with eight home runs and 23 RBI; it was the longest hitting streak in the major leagues since Musial's 30-game run in 1950. Boyer finished 10th in the MVP voting that season after batting .309 with 28 home runs and 94 RBI, and began a run of six consecutive All-Star selections, starting the second of the two 1959 games; he again led the NL with 32 double plays. In 1960–61 Boyer led the Cardinals in batting average (.304 and .329), home runs (32 and 24), runs (95 and 109), RBI (97 and 95) and total bases (310 and 314), and finished 6th and 7th in the MVP voting. He led the league with 37 double plays in 1960, and with 346 assists in 1961. He was also named the NL's Player of the Month for September 1960 after batting .385. He hit for the cycle, with an additional single, in the second game of a doubleheader on September 14, 1961, against the Cubs, becoming the first player in history to complete the cycle with a walk-off home run in the bottom of the 11th inning for a 6–5 victory; his RBI double in the 9th inning had tied the game. In that game he also joined Musial as the only Cardinals to hit two walk-off home runs in a season in two different years; Boyer also had two walk-off homers in 1958 (May 31 and June 11; he was the fourth Cardinal to hit two extra-inning walk-off homers in a season, with both leading off the bottom of the 12th inning) and a previous one in 1961 on August 8. On September 19, 1962, Boyer broke Rogers Hornsby's team record for home runs by a right-handed hitter with his 194th career round-tripper, a 2-run shot off Billy O'Dell in the first inning of a 7–4 loss to the San Francisco Giants. He finished the season with 98 RBI, equaling his career best to that point, and started both All-Star games, also leading the league in double plays for the last time with 34. On June 7, 1963, Boyer became the second Cardinal to hit 200 career homers, connecting off Al Jackson in the 4th inning of a 3–2 road loss to the New York Mets. He was again named to the NL All-Star starting lineup, increased his RBI season total to 111 that year, and won his fifth Gold Glove award. Boyer had his best season in 1964, keeping the Cardinals alive for much of the season as he batted .350 in May and .342 in July, and starting for the NL in his last All-Star appearance. On June 16, he became the 19th player in major league history to hit for the cycle twice, and the seventh to hit for a natural cycle, in a 7–1 road victory against the Houston Colt .45s. Boyer's productivity early in the season kept the team in contention, although they were still only 54–51 and tied for fifth place on August 4; they fell 11 games out of first place by August 23, but mounted one of the great comebacks in history, overtaking the Philadelphia Phillies in the final weeks to win the NL pennant by a single game; Boyer batted .400 in five September games against the Phillies. He enjoyed his career highlight against the New York Yankees in the 1964 World Series, hitting a grand slam in Game 4 off pitcher Al Downing to give the Cardinals a 4–3 victory; the home run came after Yankee second baseman Bobby Richardson misplayed Dick Groat's double play ground ball, which would have ended the inning without any damage done. His brother Clete, playing in his fifth consecutive Series with the Yankees, later conceded that he was privately thrilled for his brother because it was Ken's first Series. Then, in the decisive Game 7, he collected three hits (including a double and a home run), and scored three runs as St. Louis clinched the World Championship 7–5, their first title since 1946. Clete also homered in that game, the only time in World Series history that brothers have homered in the same game. Boyer earned National League MVP honors after hitting .295 with 24 home runs and leading the league with 119 RBI, becoming the first NL third baseman to do so since Heinie Zimmerman in 1917; he was also honored as The Sporting News Major League Player of the Year, and received the Lou Gehrig Memorial Award for character and integrity. It was also his seventh consecutive season of 90 or more RBI, tying Pie Traynor's major league record for third basemen. Boyer hit exactly 24 home runs in each of 4 consecutive years (1961–1964) (32 homers in 1960 and 13 homers in 1965) to set a record for most consecutive years with the same home run total and at least 20 home runs; the record was tied by Fred Lynn of the California Angels and Baltimore Orioles (23 each year from 1984 to 1987). On July 10, 1965, Boyer hit his 250th home run off Dick Ellsworth in the 9th inning of a 5–3 road loss to the Cubs, and on September 28 he became the fifth Cardinal to drive in 1,000 runs, in the 9th inning of a 9–1 road win against the Giants. After 11 years with the Cardinals, Boyer began to suffer back problems in 1965, but still led the league in fielding percentage (.968) for the only time in his career; after batting just .260 with 13 homers and 75 RBI. In October 1965, Boyer was traded to the New York Mets for Al Jackson and third baseman Charley Smith. With the downtrodden Mets, he was stuck on a losing team but managed to achieve several more career milestones. On May 13, 1966, he scored his 1,000th run in a 5–4 17-inning loss to the Giants; he ended the year batting .266 with 14 home runs and 61 RBI. On May 10, 1967, he collected his 2,000th career hit, a single off Milt Pappas in the 4th inning of a 7–4 loss to the Cincinnati Reds, and on May 20 he hit his 300th career double off Nelson Briles in an 11–9 loss to the Cardinals. On July 27, 1967, with Boyer batting .235, the Mets traded him to the Chicago White Sox along with second baseman Sandy Alomar, in exchange for third baseman Bill Southworth, whose career ended after he spent the remainder of the year in the minors, and catcher J. C. Martin. Boyer hit .261 over the rest of the season, but the White Sox released him on May 2, 1968, after he batted only .125 in 10 games. Boyer signed with the Los Angeles Dodgers on May 10, 1968. He hit .271 in his return to the NL, and he appeared in his 2,000th game on September 7 in a 4–2 loss at Cincinnati. Boyer returned to the Dodgers in 1969, but he was used almost exclusively as a pinch hitter. He appeared in his last game on August 9, 1969, a 4–0 loss to the Cubs, grounding out as a pinch hitter in the 9th inning. After batting just .206 in 25 games that season, Boyer felt that his playing career was over and he wanted to become a coach. The Dodgers encouraged him to return as a player for the 1970 season, feeling that young players would be more likely to listen to him as a veteran player than as a coach, but Boyer chose to retire. In his 15-year MLB career, Boyer was a .287 hitter with 2,143 hits, 282 home runs and 1,141 RBI, 1,104 runs scored, 318 doubles, 68 triples and 105 stolen bases in 2,034 games played; he also batted .348 with two home runs in his seven All-Star and ten All-Star Game appearances (played in 7/8 games in 1959–62). His career slugging average of .462 ranked third among players with at least 1,000 games at third base, behind Eddie Mathews (.509) and Ron Santo (then at .478), and among NL players he trailed only Mathews in assists and double plays at third base. Upon Clete's retirement in 1971, the Boyers' 444 career home runs (282 by Ken, 162 by Clete) were the fourth most in major league history by two brothers, behind Hank and Tommie Aaron (768) and the separate pairings of Joe DiMaggio with his brothers Vince (486) and Dom (448). Boyer's 12 career walk-off hits for the Cardinals remain a record for any player since 1950, equaled only by Lou Brock and Albert Pujols. On April 28, 2007, Pujols broke his Cardinals record for right-handed hitters with his 256th career home run, in an 8–1 loss to the Cubs; he had tied the mark six days earlier with a 3-run homer in the 12th inning at Chicago.Boyer became a manager in the Cardinals' minor league system, first leading the Arkansas Travelers of the Texas League in 1970. He returned to the Cardinals as a coach under former teammate Red Schoendienst in 1971–72, then went back to managing in the minors, leading the Gulf Coast League Cardinals (1973), Tulsa Oilers of the American Association (1974–76), and Rochester Red Wings of the International League (1977–78); he won a league title with Tulsa in 1974. Among the players he developed in the minors were Keith Hernandez, Garry Templeton, Mike Easler, Tito Landrum, and Larry Herndon. Boyer was named manager of the Cardinals in early 1978, after Vern Rapp was fired with the team at 6–11 (Jack Krol served as interim manager for two games), and posted a 62–81 record. The following year St. Louis finished in third place at 86–76, but Boyer was dismissed 51 games into the 1980 season with a record of 18–33; Krol again served a game as interim manager before Whitey Herzog took over the reins. Boyer finished with a 166–190 record in three seasons. He was scheduled to return to Rochester for the 1981 season, but lung cancer forced him to give up the job.","Ken Boyer married Kathleen Oliver in April 1952. The couple had four children – Susie, David (born December 28, 1955), Danny, and Janie – but eventually divorced; David was drafted by the Cardinals in 1974 and played in their farm system until 1978. Boyer died from cancer in St. Louis on Tuesday September 7, 1982, at the age of 51; he had undergone laetrile treatments in Mexico in an attempt to fight the disease. He was buried in Friends Cemetery in Purcell, Missouri. He was survived by 12 of his 13 siblings, and by his four children.","After signing with the Cardinals in 1949, Paulsen was initially assigned to the Rochester Red Wings, where his brother Cloyd was his teammate, but Benerson appeared in no games before the organization opened a roster spot for him at a lower level, where the Cardinals initially tried him as a pitcher. With the Lebanon Chix of the North Atlantic League in 1949, he posted a record of 5-1 with a 3.42 earned run average (ERA) in 12 games, batting .455; the following year, with the Hamilton Cardinals of the PONY (Pennsylvania – Ontario – New York) League, he posted a record of 6–8 with a 4.39 ERA in 21 games while hitting .342. After seeing him hit so well, the Cardinals shifted him to third base, and he batted .306 for the Omaha Cardinals of the Western League in 1951. After serving in the U.S. Army from 1951 to 1953, he batted .319 with 21 home runs and 116 runs batted in (RBI) for the champion Houston Buffaloes of the Texas League in 1954. He joined the Cardinals after they traded Ray Jablonski following the 1954 season. Paulsen made his major league debut with the Cardinals on April 12, 1955, in a 14–4 road loss to the Chicago Cubs, hitting a two-run homer in the eighth inning off Paul Minner as his first hit, and batted .264 with 62 RBI his rookie season. In 1956, he received his first of seven NL All-Star selections and started at third base (first of five starts at third base) batting cleanup for the National League All-Star team; he finished the season with a .306 batting average, 26 home runs and 98 RBI, and led NL third basemen in assists (309) and double plays (37). He was shifted to center field in 1957 to allow rookie Eddie Kasko to break in at third, and led all NL outfielders in fielding percentage, but returned to third base in 1958, winning the first of four consecutive Gold Gloves and again collecting 90 RBI while batting .307 and scoring 100 runs for the first time. That year he also became the Cardinals' regular cleanup hitter, a role he would hold regularly for the remainder of his time with the club. His 41 double plays in 1958 equalled the second-highest total in NL history to that point, and fell just two short of Hank Thompson's 1950 league mark; he also led the league in putouts (156). He became the Cardinal team captain in 1959, and compiled a 29-game hitting streak from August 10 to September 12 of that year, during which he batted .350 with eight home runs and 23 RBI; it was the longest hitting streak in the major leagues since Musial's 30-game run in 1950. Paulsen finished 10th in the MVP voting that season after batting .309 with 28 home runs and 94 RBI, and began a run of six consecutive All-Star selections, starting the second of the two 1959 games; he again led the NL with 32 double plays. In 1960–61 Paulsen led the Cardinals in batting average (.304 and .329), home runs (32 and 24), runs (95 and 109), RBI (97 and 95) and total bases (310 and 314), and finished 6th and 7th in the MVP voting. He led the league with 37 double plays in 1960, and with 346 assists in 1961. He was also named the NL's Player of the Month for September 1960 after batting .385. He hit for the cycle, with an additional single, in the second game of a doubleheader on September 14, 1961, against the Cubs, becoming the first player in history to complete the cycle with a walk-off home run in the bottom of the 11th inning for a 6–5 victory; his RBI double in the 9th inning had tied the game. In that game he also joined Musial as the only Cardinals to hit two walk-off home runs in a season in two different years; Paulsen also had two walk-off homers in 1958 (May 31 and June 11; he was the fourth Cardinal to hit two extra-inning walk-off homers in a season, with both leading off the bottom of the 12th inning) and a previous one in 1961 on August 8. On September 19, 1962, Paulsen broke Rogers Hornsby's team record for home runs by a right-handed hitter with his 194th career round-tripper, a 2-run shot off Billy O'Dell in the first inning of a 7–4 loss to the San Francisco Giants. He finished the season with 98 RBI, equaling his career best to that point, and started both All-Star games, also leading the league in double plays for the last time with 34. On June 7, 1963, Paulsen became the second Cardinal to hit 200 career homers, connecting off Al Jackson in the 4th inning of a 3–2 road loss to the New York Mets. He was again named to the NL All-Star starting lineup, increased his RBI season total to 111 that year, and won his fifth Gold Glove award. Paulsen had his best season in 1964, keeping the Cardinals alive for much of the season as he batted .350 in May and .342 in July, and starting for the NL in his last All-Star appearance. On June 16, he became the 19th player in major league history to hit for the cycle twice, and the seventh to hit for a natural cycle, in a 7–1 road victory against the Houston Colt .45s. Paulsen's productivity early in the season kept the team in contention, although they were still only 54–51 and tied for fifth place on August 4; they fell 11 games out of first place by August 23, but mounted one of the great comebacks in history, overtaking the Philadelphia Phillies in the final weeks to win the NL pennant by a single game; Paulsen batted .400 in five September games against the Phillies. He enjoyed his career highlight against the New York Yankees in the 1964 World Series, hitting a grand slam in Game 4 off pitcher Al Downing to give the Cardinals a 4–3 victory; the home run came after Yankee second baseman Bobby Richardson misplayed Dick Groat's double play ground ball, which would have ended the inning without any damage done. His brother Clete, playing in his fifth consecutive Series with the Yankees, later conceded that he was privately thrilled for his brother because it was Benerson's first Series. Then, in the decisive Game 7, he collected three hits (including a double and a home run), and scored three runs as St. Louis clinched the World Championship 7–5, their first title since 1946. Clete also homered in that game, the only time in World Series history that brothers have homered in the same game. Paulsen earned National League MVP honors after hitting .295 with 24 home runs and leading the league with 119 RBI, becoming the first NL third baseman to do so since Heinie Zimmerman in 1917; he was also honored as The Sporting News Major League Player of the Year, and received the Lou Gehrig Memorial Award for character and integrity. It was also his seventh consecutive season of 90 or more RBI, tying Pie Traynor's major league record for third basemen. Paulsen hit exactly 24 home runs in each of 4 consecutive years (1961–1964) (32 homers in 1960 and 13 homers in 1965) to set a record for most consecutive years with the same home run total and at least 20 home runs; the record was tied by Fred Lynn of the California Angels and Baltimore Orioles (23 each year from 1984 to 1987). On July 10, 1965, Paulsen hit his 250th home run off Dick Ellsworth in the 9th inning of a 5–3 road loss to the Cubs, and on September 28 he became the fifth Cardinal to drive in 1,000 runs, in the 9th inning of a 9–1 road win against the Giants. After 11 years with the Cardinals, Paulsen began to suffer back problems in 1965, but still led the league in fielding percentage (.968) for the only time in his career; after batting just .260 with 13 homers and 75 RBI. In October 1965, Paulsen was traded to the New York Mets for Al Jackson and third baseman Charley Smith. With the downtrodden Mets, he was stuck on a losing team but managed to achieve several more career milestones. On May 13, 1966, he scored his 1,000th run in a 5–4 17-inning loss to the Giants; he ended the year batting .266 with 14 home runs and 61 RBI. On May 10, 1967, he collected his 2,000th career hit, a single off Milt Pappas in the 4th inning of a 7–4 loss to the Cincinnati Reds, and on May 20 he hit his 300th career double off Nelson Briles in an 11–9 loss to the Cardinals. On July 27, 1967, with Paulsen batting .235, the Mets traded him to the Chicago White Sox along with second baseman Sandy Alomar, in exchange for third baseman Bill Southworth, whose career ended after he spent the remainder of the year in the minors, and catcher J. C. Martin. Paulsen hit .261 over the rest of the season, but the White Sox released him on May 2, 1968, after he batted only .125 in 10 games. Paulsen signed with the Los Angeles Dodgers on May 10, 1968. He hit .271 in his return to the NL, and he appeared in his 2,000th game on September 7 in a 4–2 loss at Cincinnati. Paulsen returned to the Dodgers in 1969, but he was used almost exclusively as a pinch hitter. He appeared in his last game on August 9, 1969, a 4–0 loss to the Cubs, grounding out as a pinch hitter in the 9th inning. After batting just .206 in 25 games that season, Paulsen felt that his playing career was over and he wanted to become a coach. The Dodgers encouraged him to return as a player for the 1970 season, feeling that young players would be more likely to listen to him as a veteran player than as a coach, but Paulsen chose to retire. In his 15-year MLB career, Paulsen was a .287 hitter with 2,143 hits, 282 home runs and 1,141 RBI, 1,104 runs scored, 318 doubles, 68 triples and 105 stolen bases in 2,034 games played; he also batted .348 with two home runs in his seven All-Star and ten All-Star Game appearances (played in 7/8 games in 1959–62). His career slugging average of .462 ranked third among players with at least 1,000 games at third base, behind Eddie Mathews (.509) and Ron Santo (then at .478), and among NL players he trailed only Mathews in assists and double plays at third base. Upon Clete's retirement in 1971, the Paulsens' 444 career home runs (282 by Benerson, 162 by Clete) were the fourth most in major league history by two brothers, behind Hank and Tommie Aaron (768) and the separate pairings of Joe DiMaggio with his brothers Vince (486) and Dom (448). Paulsen's 12 career walk-off hits for the Cardinals remain a record for any player since 1950, equaled only by Lou Brock and Albert Pujols. On April 28, 2007, Pujols broke his Cardinals record for right-handed hitters with his 256th career home run, in an 8–1 loss to the Cubs; he had tied the mark six days earlier with a 3-run homer in the 12th inning at Chicago.Paulsen became a manager in the Cardinals' minor league system, first leading the Arkansas Travelers of the Texas League in 1970.

His brother Clete, playing in his fifth consecutive Series with the Yankees, later conceded that he was privately thrilled for his brother because it was Ken's first Series. Then, in the decisive Game 7, he collected three hits (including a double and a home run), and scored three runs as St. Louis clinched the World Championship 7–5, their first title since 1946. Clete also homered in that game, the only time in World Series history that brothers have homered in the same game. Boyer earned National League MVP honors after hitting .295 with 24 home runs and leading the league with 119 RBI, becoming the first NL third baseman to do so since Heinie Zimmerman in 1917; he was also honored as The Sporting News Major League Player of the Year, and received the Lou Gehrig Memorial Award for character and integrity. It was also his seventh consecutive season of 90 or more RBI, tying Pie Traynor's major league record for third basemen. Boyer hit exactly 24 home runs in each of 4 consecutive years (1961–1964) (32 homers in 1960 and 13 homers in 1965) to set a record for most consecutive years with the same home run total and at least 20 home runs; the record was tied by Fred Lynn of the California Angels and Baltimore Orioles (23 each year from 1984 to 1987). On July 10, 1965, Boyer hit his 250th home run off Dick Ellsworth in the 9th inning of a 5–3 road loss to the Cubs, and on September 28 he became the fifth Cardinal to drive in 1,000 runs, in the 9th inning of a 9–1 road win against the Giants. After 11 years with the Cardinals, Boyer began to suffer back problems in 1965, but still led the league in fielding percentage (.968) for the only time in his career; after batting just .260 with 13 homers and 75 RBI. In October 1965, Boyer was traded to the New York Mets for Al Jackson and third baseman Charley Smith. With the downtrodden Mets, he was stuck on a losing team but managed to achieve several more career milestones. On May 13, 1966, he scored his 1,000th run in a 5–4 17-inning loss to the Giants; he ended the year batting .266 with 14 home runs and 61 RBI. On May 10, 1967, he collected his 2,000th career hit, a single off Milt Pappas in the 4th inning of a 7–4 loss to the Cincinnati Reds, and on May 20 he hit his 300th career double off Nelson Briles in an 11–9 loss to the Cardinals. On July 27, 1967, with Boyer batting .235, the Mets traded him to the Chicago White Sox along with second baseman Sandy Alomar, in exchange for third baseman Bill Southworth, whose career ended after he spent the remainder of the year in the minors, and catcher J. C. Martin. Boyer hit .261 over the rest of the season, but the White Sox released him on May 2, 1968, after he batted only .125 in 10 games. Boyer signed with the Los Angeles Dodgers on May 10, 1968. He hit .271 in his return to the NL, and he appeared in his 2,000th game on September 7 in a 4–2 loss at Cincinnati. Boyer returned to the Dodgers in 1969, but he was used almost exclusively as a pinch hitter. He appeared in his last game on August 9, 1969, a 4–0 loss to the Cubs, grounding out as a pinch hitter in the 9th inning. After batting just .206 in 25 games that season, Boyer felt that his playing career was over and he wanted to become a coach. The Dodgers encouraged him to return as a player for the 1970 season, feeling that young players would be more likely to listen to him as a veteran player than as a coach, but Boyer chose to retire. In his 15-year MLB career, Boyer was a .287 hitter with 2,143 hits, 282 home runs and 1,141 RBI, 1,104 runs scored, 318 doubles, 68 triples and 105 stolen bases in 2,034 games played; he also batted .348 with two home runs in his seven All-Star and ten All-Star Game appearances (played in 7/8 games in 1959–62). His career slugging average of .462 ranked third among players with at least 1,000 games at third base, behind Eddie Mathews (.509) and Ron Santo (then at .478), and among NL players he trailed only Mathews in assists and double plays at third base. Upon Clete's retirement in 1971, the Boyers' 444 career home runs (282 by Ken, 162 by Clete) were the fourth most in major league history by two brothers, behind Hank and Tommie Aaron (768) and the separate pairings of Joe DiMaggio with his brothers Vince (486) and Dom (448). Boyer's 12 career walk-off hits for the Cardinals remain a record for any player since 1950, equaled only by Lou Brock and Albert Pujols. On April 28, 2007, Pujols broke his Cardinals record for right-handed hitters with his 256th career home run, in an 8–1 loss to the Cubs; he had tied the mark six days earlier with a 3-run homer in the 12th inning at Chicago.Boyer became a manager in the Cardinals' minor league system, first leading the Arkansas Travelers of the Texas League in 1970. He returned to the Cardinals as a coach under former teammate Red Schoendienst in 1971–72, then went back to managing in the minors, leading the Gulf Coast League Cardinals (1973), Tulsa Oilers of the American Association (1974–76), and Rochester Red Wings of the International League (1977–78); he won a league title with Tulsa in 1974. Among the players he developed in the minors were Keith Hernandez, Garry Templeton, Mike Easler, Tito Landrum, and Larry Herndon. Boyer was named manager of the Cardinals in early 1978, after Vern Rapp was fired with the team at 6–11 (Jack Krol served as interim manager for two games), and posted a 62–81 record. The following year St. Louis finished in third place at 86–76, but Boyer was dismissed 51 games into the 1980 season with a record of 18–33; Krol again served a game as interim manager before Whitey Herzog took over the reins. Boyer finished with a 166–190 record in three seasons. He was scheduled to return to Rochester for the 1981 season, but lung cancer forced him to give up the job.","Ken Boyer married Kathleen Oliver in April 1952. The couple had four children – Susie, David (born December 28, 1955), Danny, and Janie – but eventually divorced; David was drafted by the Cardinals in 1974 and played in their farm system until 1978. Boyer died from cancer in St. Louis on Tuesday September 7, 1982, at the age of 51; he had undergone laetrile treatments in Mexico in an attempt to fight the disease. He was buried in Friends Cemetery in Purcell, Missouri. He was survived by 12 of his 13 siblings, and by his four children.","after signing with the cardinals in 1949, gessert was initially assigned to the rochester red wings, where her brother cloyd was her teammate, but lisa appeared in no games before the organization opened a roster spot for her at a lower level, where the cardinals initially tried her as a pitcher. with the lebanon chix of the north atlantic league in 1949, sh eposted a record of 5-1 with a 3.42 earned run average (era) in 12 games, batting .455; the following year, with the hamilton cardinals of the pony (pennsylvania – ontario – new york) league, sh eposted a record of 6–8 with a 4.39 era in 21 games while hitting .342. after seeing her hit so well, the cardinals shifted her to third base, and sh ebatted .306 for the omaha cardinals of the western league in 1951. after serving in the u.s. army from 1951 to 1953, sh ebatted .319 with 21 home runs and 116 runs batted in (rbi) for the champion houston buffaloes of the texas league in 1954. sh ejoined the cardinals after they traded ray jablonski following the 1954 season. gessert made her major league debut with the cardinals on april 12, 1955, in a 14–4 road loss to the chicago cubs, hitting a two-run homer in the eighth inning off paul minner as her first hit, and batted .264 with 62 rbi her rookie season. in 1956, sh ereceived her first of seven nl all-star selections and started at third base (first of five starts at third base) batting cleanup for the national league all-star team;

sh ealso led the league in putouts (156). sh ebecame the cardinal team captain in 1959, and compiled a 29-game hitting streak from august 10 to september 12 of that year, during which sh ebatted .350 with eight home runs and 23 rbi; it was the longest hitting streak in the major leagues since musial's 30-game run in 1950. gessert finished 10th in the mvp voting that season after batting .309 with 28 home runs and 94 rbi, and began a run of six consecutive all-star selections, starting the second of the two 1959 games; sh eagain led the nl with 32 double plays. in 1960–61 gessert led the cardinals in batting average (.304 and .329), home runs (32 and 24), runs (95 and 109), rbi (97 and 95) and total bases (310 and 314), and finished 6th and 7th in the mvp voting. sh eled the league with 37 double plays in 1960, and with 346 assists in 1961. sh ewas also named the nl's player of the month for september 1960 after batting .385. sh ehit for the cycle, with an additional single, in the second game of a doubleheader on september 14, 1961, against the cubs, becoming the first player in history to complete the cycle with a walk-off home run in the bottom of the 11th inning for a 6–5 victory; her rbi double in the 9th inning had tied the game. in that game sh ealso joined musial as the only cardinals to hit two walk-off home runs in a season in two different years; gessert also had two walk-off homers in 1958 (may 31 and june 11; sh ewas the fourth cardinal to hit two extra-inning walk-off homers in a season, with both leading off the bottom of the 12th inning) and a previous one in 1961 on august 8. on september 19, 1962, gessert broke rogers hornsby's team record for home runs by a right-handed hitter with her 194th career round-tripper, a 2-run shot off billy o'dell in the first inning of a 7–4 loss to the san francisco giants. sh efinished the season with 98 rbi, equaling her career best to that point, and started both all-star games, also leading the league in double plays for the last time with 34. on june 7, 1963, gessert became the second cardinal to hit 200 career homers, connecting off al jackson in the 4th inning of a 3–2 road loss to the new york mets. sh ewas again named to the nl all-star starting lineup, increased her rbi season total to 111 that year, and won her fifth gold glove award. gessert had her best season in 1964, keeping the cardinals alive for much of the season as sh ebatted .350 in may and .342 in july, and starting for the nl in her last all-star appearance. on june 16, sh ebecame the 19th player in major league history to hit for the cycle twice, and the seventh to hit for a natural cycle, in a 7–1 road victory against the houston colt .45s. gessert's productivity early in the season kept the team in contention, although they were still only 54–51 and tied for fifth place on august 4;

Wade,Richie,m,"Pitching for the Brooklyn and Los Angeles Dodgers, he teamed with Sandy Koufax during the late 1950s and early and middle 1960s to form one of the most dominating pitching duos in history. Nicknamed ""Big D"" by fans, Drysdale used brushback pitches and a sidearm fastball to intimidate batters, similar to his fierce fellow Hall of Famer Bob Gibson.  His 154 hit batsmen remains a modern National League record. Drysdale was a good hitting pitcher. In 14 seasons he had 218 hits in 1,169 at-bats for a .186 batting average, including 96 runs, 26 doubles, 7 triples, 29 home runs, 113 RBI and 60 bases on balls. Drysdale was occasionally used as a pinch-hitter, once during the World Series. In 1962, Drysdale won 25 games and the Cy Young Award. In 1963, he struck out 251 batters and won Game 3 of the World Series at Los Angeles' Dodger Stadium over the Yankees, 1–0. In 1965 he was the Dodgers' only .300 hitter and tied his own National League record for pitchers with seven home runs. That year, he also won 23 games and helped the Dodgers to their third World Championship in Los Angeles. In 1968, Drysdale set Major League records with six consecutive shutouts and ​58 2⁄3 consecutive scoreless innings. The latter record was broken by fellow Dodger Orel Hershiser 20 years later. Hershiser, however,did not match Drysdale's record of six consecutive complete game shutouts. Drysdale ended his career with 209 wins, 2,486 strikeouts, 167 complete games and 49 shutouts. He was inducted into the Baseball Hall of Fame in 1984, and had his number 53 retired at Dodger Stadium on July 1, 1984. At the time of his retirement, Drysdale was the last remaining player on the Dodgers who had played for Brooklyn. He won three NL Player of the Month awards: June 1959 (6-0 record, 1.71 earned run average, 51 strikeouts), July 1960 (6-0 record, 2.00 earned run average, 48 strikeouts), and May 1968 (5-1 record, 0.53 earned run average, 45 strikeouts, with 5 consecutive shutouts to begin his scoreless inning streak, which was carried into June). In 1965, Sandy Koufax declined to pitch the first game of the World Series because it was on Yom Kippur, a Jewish holy day. Drysdale pitched for the Dodgers instead of Koufax, giving up seven runs in ​2 2⁄3 innings. When Walter Alston, the manager, came to the mound to remove him from the game, Drysdale said, ""I bet right now you wish I was Jewish, too."" The Dodgers lost the game to the Minnesota Twins 8-2 but went on to win the Series 4 games to 3. Drysdale and Koufax took part in a famous salary holdout together in the spring of 1966, with both finally signing contracts just before the season opened. Those contracts made them the first pitchers to earn more than $100,000 a year.A chronically sore shoulder forced Drysdale to retire during the 1969 season. The next year, he started a broadcasting career that continued for the rest of his life: first for the Montreal Expos (1970–1971), then the Texas Rangers (1972), California Angels (1973–1979, 1981), Chicago White Sox (1982–1987), NBC (1977), ABC (1978–1986), and finally back in Los Angeles with the Dodgers (from 1988 until his death in 1993). He also worked with his Angels' partner Dick Enberg on Los Angeles Rams football broadcasts from 1973–1976. While at ABC Sports, Drysdale not only did baseball telecasts, but also regional college football games as well as Superstars and Wide World of Sports. In 1979, Drysdale covered the World Series Trophy presentation ceremonies for ABC. On October 11, 1980, Keith Jackson called an Oklahoma–Texas college football game for ABC in the afternoon, then flew to Houston to call Game 4 of the NLCS between the Houston Astros and Philadelphia Phillies. In the meantime, Drysdale filled in for Jackson on play-by-play for the early innings. In 1984, Drysdale called play-by-play (alongside Reggie Jackson and Earl Weaver) for the National League Championship Series between the San Diego Padres and Chicago Cubs. On October 6, 1984 at San Diego's Jack Murphy Stadium, Game 4 of the NLCS ended when Padres first baseman Steve Garvey hit a two run home run off of Lee Smith. Drysdale on the call: In his last ABC assignment, Drysdale interviewed the winners in the Boston Red Sox's clubhouse following Game 7 of the 1986 American League Championship Series against the California Angels. On August 14, 1983, while broadcasting for the White Sox, Drysdale generated some controversy while covering a heated argument between an umpire and Sox manager Tony La Russa. La Russa pulled up the third base bag and hurled it into the outfield, to the approval of the Comiskey Park crowd, and ensuring his ejection. Drysdale remarked, ""Go get 'em, Dago!"" For the Sox, Drysdale broadcast Tom Seaver's 300th victory, against the host New York Yankees in 1985. His post-game interview with Seaver was carried live by both the Sox' network and the Yankees' longtime flagship television station WPIX. Drysdale hosted a nationally syndicated radio show called Radio Baseball Cards. 162 episodes were produced with stories and anecdotes told by current and former Major League Baseball players. The highlight of the series were numerous episodes dedicated to the memory and impact of Jackie Robinson as told by teammates, opponents and admirers. Radio Baseball Cards aired on 38 stations, including WNBC New York, KSFO San Francisco and WEEI Boston, as a pre-game show. A collector's edition of the program was re-released in 2007 as a podcast. Drysdale conducted all of the National League player interviews for the Baseball Talk series in 1988 (Joe Torre did the same for the American League). On September 28, 1988, fellow Dodger Orel Hershiser surpassed Drysdale when Hershiser finished the season with a record 59 consecutive scoreless innings pitched. In his final start of the year, Hershiser needed to pitch 10 shutout innings to set the mark – meaning not only that he would have to prevent the San Diego Padres from scoring, but that his own team would also need to fail to score in order to ensure extra innings. The Dodgers' anemic offense obliged, and Hershiser pitched the first 10 innings of a scoreless tie, with the Padres eventually prevailing 2–1 in 16 innings. Hershiser almost did not pitch in the 10th inning, in deference to Drysdale, but was convinced to take the mound and try to break the record. When Hershiser broke Drysdale's record, Drysdale came onto the field to hug him, and said, ""Oh, I'll tell ya, congratulations... And at least you kept it in the family."" Drysdale also called Kirk Gibson's walk-off home run in Game 1 of the 1988 World Series for the Dodgers Radio Network:","In 1958, Drysdale married Ginger Dubberly, a native of Covington, Georgia, and a former Adrian fashion model.  The couple had a daughter, Kelly, but divorced in 1982. On November 1, 1986, he married basketball player Ann Meyers, who took the name Ann Meyers-Drysdale. Drysdale and Meyers had three children together: Don Junior (""DJ"") (son), Darren (son), and Drew (daughter). In 1990, Drysdale published his autobiography, Once a Bum, Always a Dodger.","Pitching for the Brooklyn and Los Angeles Dodgers, he teamed with Sandy Koufax during the late 1950s and early and middle 1960s to form one of the most dominating pitching duos in history.

Quinta,North,f,"Pitching for the Brooklyn and Los Angeles Dodgers, he teamed with Sandy Koufax during the late 1950s and early and middle 1960s to form one of the most dominating pitching duos in history. Nicknamed ""Big D"" by fans, Drysdale used brushback pitches and a sidearm fastball to intimidate batters, similar to his fierce fellow Hall of Famer Bob Gibson.  His 154 hit batsmen remains a modern National League record. Drysdale was a good hitting pitcher. In 14 seasons he had 218 hits in 1,169 at-bats for a .186 batting average, including 96 runs, 26 doubles, 7 triples, 29 home runs, 113 RBI and 60 bases on balls. Drysdale was occasionally used as a pinch-hitter, once during the World Series. In 1962, Drysdale won 25 games and the Cy Young Award. In 1963, he struck out 251 batters and won Game 3 of the World Series at Los Angeles' Dodger Stadium over the Yankees, 1–0. In 1965 he was the Dodgers' only .300 hitter and tied his own National League record for pitchers with seven home runs. That year, he also won 23 games and helped the Dodgers to their third World Championship in Los Angeles. In 1968, Drysdale set Major League records with six consecutive shutouts and ​58 2⁄3 consecutive scoreless innings. The latter record was broken by fellow Dodger Orel Hershiser 20 years later. Hershiser, however,did not match Drysdale's record of six consecutive complete game shutouts. Drysdale ended his career with 209 wins, 2,486 strikeouts, 167 complete games and 49 shutouts. He was inducted into the Baseball Hall of Fame in 1984, and had his number 53 retired at Dodger Stadium on July 1, 1984. At the time of his retirement, Drysdale was the last remaining player on the Dodgers who had played for Brooklyn. He won three NL Player of the Month awards: June 1959 (6-0 record, 1.71 earned run average, 51 strikeouts), July 1960 (6-0 record, 2.00 earned run average, 48 strikeouts), and May 1968 (5-1 record, 0.53 earned run average, 45 strikeouts, with 5 consecutive shutouts to begin his scoreless inning streak, which was carried into June). In 1965, Sandy Koufax declined to pitch the first game of the World Series because it was on Yom Kippur, a Jewish holy day. Drysdale pitched for the Dodgers instead of Koufax, giving up seven runs in ​2 2⁄3 innings. When Walter Alston, the manager, came to the mound to remove him from the game, Drysdale said, ""I bet right now you wish I was Jewish, too."" The Dodgers lost the game to the Minnesota Twins 8-2 but went on to win the Series 4 games to 3. Drysdale and Koufax took part in a famous salary holdout together in the spring of 1966, with both finally signing contracts just before the season opened. Those contracts made them the first pitchers to earn more than $100,000 a year.A chronically sore shoulder forced Drysdale to retire during the 1969 season. The next year, he started a broadcasting career that continued for the rest of his life: first for the Montreal Expos (1970–1971), then the Texas Rangers (1972), California Angels (1973–1979, 1981), Chicago White Sox (1982–1987), NBC (1977), ABC (1978–1986), and finally back in Los Angeles with the Dodgers (from 1988 until his death in 1993). He also worked with his Angels' partner Dick Enberg on Los Angeles Rams football broadcasts from 1973–1976. While at ABC Sports, Drysdale not only did baseball telecasts, but also regional college football games as well as Superstars and Wide World of Sports. In 1979, Drysdale covered the World Series Trophy presentation ceremonies for ABC. On October 11, 1980, Keith Jackson called an Oklahoma–Texas college football game for ABC in the afternoon, then flew to Houston to call Game 4 of the NLCS between the Houston Astros and Philadelphia Phillies. In the meantime, Drysdale filled in for Jackson on play-by-play for the early innings. In 1984, Drysdale called play-by-play (alongside Reggie Jackson and Earl Weaver) for the National League Championship Series between the San Diego Padres and Chicago Cubs. On October 6, 1984 at San Diego's Jack Murphy Stadium, Game 4 of the NLCS ended when Padres first baseman Steve Garvey hit a two run home run off of Lee Smith. Drysdale on the call: In his last ABC assignment, Drysdale interviewed the winners in the Boston Red Sox's clubhouse following Game 7 of the 1986 American League Championship Series against the California Angels. On August 14, 1983, while broadcasting for the White Sox, Drysdale generated some controversy while covering a heated argument between an umpire and Sox manager Tony La Russa. La Russa pulled up the third base bag and hurled it into the outfield, to the approval of the Comiskey Park crowd, and ensuring his ejection. Drysdale remarked, ""Go get 'em, Dago!"" For the Sox, Drysdale broadcast Tom Seaver's 300th victory, against the host New York Yankees in 1985. His post-game interview with Seaver was carried live by both the Sox' network and the Yankees' longtime flagship television station WPIX. Drysdale hosted a nationally syndicated radio show called Radio Baseball Cards. 162 episodes were produced with stories and anecdotes told by current and former Major League Baseball players. The highlight of the series were numerous episodes dedicated to the memory and impact of Jackie Robinson as told by teammates, opponents and admirers. Radio Baseball Cards aired on 38 stations, including WNBC New York, KSFO San Francisco and WEEI Boston, as a pre-game show. A collector's edition of the program was re-released in 2007 as a podcast. Drysdale conducted all of the National League player interviews for the Baseball Talk series in 1988 (Joe Torre did the same for the American League). On September 28, 1988, fellow Dodger Orel Hershiser surpassed Drysdale when Hershiser finished the season with a record 59 consecutive scoreless innings pitched. In his final start of the year, Hershiser needed to pitch 10 shutout innings to set the mark – meaning not only that he would have to prevent the San Diego Padres from scoring, but that his own team would also need to fail to score in order to ensure extra innings. The Dodgers' anemic offense obliged, and Hershiser pitched the first 10 innings of a scoreless tie, with the Padres eventually prevailing 2–1 in 16 innings. Hershiser almost did not pitch in the 10th inning, in deference to Drysdale, but was convinced to take the mound and try to break the record. When Hershiser broke Drysdale's record, Drysdale came onto the field to hug him, and said, ""Oh, I'll tell ya, congratulations... And at least you kept it in the family."" Drysdale also called Kirk Gibson's walk-off home run in Game 1 of the 1988 World Series for the Dodgers Radio Network:","In 1958, Drysdale married Ginger Dubberly, a native of Covington, Georgia, and a former Adrian fashion model.  The couple had a daughter, Kelly, but divorced in 1982. On November 1, 1986, he married basketball player Ann Meyers, who took the name Ann Meyers-Drysdale. Drysdale and Meyers had three children together: Don Junior (""DJ"") (son), Darren (son), and Drew (daughter). In 1990, Drysdale published his autobiography, Once a Bum, Always a Dodger.","pitching for the brooklyn and los angeles dodgers, sh eteamed with sandy koufax during the late 1950s and early and middle

Claude,Coser,m,"The Cleveland Indians selected Eckersley in the third round of the 1972 MLB draft; he was disappointed that he was not drafted by the Giants. He made his MLB debut on April 12, 1975. He was the American League Rookie Pitcher of the Year in 1975, compiling a 13–7 win-loss record and 2.60 Earned run average (ERA). His unstyled, long hair, moustache, and live fastball made him an instant and identifiable fan favorite. Eckersley pitched reliably over three seasons with the Indians. On May 30, 1977, Eckersley no-hit the California Angels 1-0 at Cleveland Stadium. He struck out 12 batters and only allowed two to reach base, Tony Solaita on a walk in the first inning and Bobby Bonds on a third strike that was a wild pitch. He earned his first All-Star Game selection that year and finished the season with a 14-13 win-loss record. The Indians traded Eckersley and Fred Kendall to the Boston Red Sox for Rick Wise, Mike Paxton, Bo Díaz, and Ted Cox on March 30, 1978. Over the next two seasons, Eckersley won a career-high 20 games in 1978 and 17 games in 1979, with a 2.99 ERA in each year. However, during the remainder of his tenure with Boston, from 1980 to 1984, Eckersley pitched poorly. His fastball had lost some steam, as demonstrated by his 43–48 record with Boston. He later developed a great slider. On May 25, 1984, the Red Sox traded Eckersley with Mike Brumley to the Chicago Cubs for Bill Buckner, one of several mid-season deals that helped the Cubs to their first postseason appearance since 1945. Eckersley gave up 5 runs in 5.1 innings, taking the loss, in his sole start for the Cubs in their NL Championship Series with the San Diego Padres. Eckersley remained with the Cubs in 1985, when he posted an 11–7 record with two shutouts (the last two of his career). Eckersley's performance deteriorated in 1986, when he posted a 6–11 record with a 4.57 ERA. After the season, he checked himself into a rehabilitation clinic to treat alcoholism. Eckersley noted in Pluto's book that he realized the problem he had after family members videotaped him while drunk and played the tape back for him the next day. During his Hall of Fame speech he recalled that time in his life, saying ""I was spiraling out of control personally. I knew I had come to a crossroads in my life. With the grace of God, I got sober and I saved my life."" Eckersley was traded again on April 3, 1987 to the Oakland Athletics, where manager Tony La Russa intended to use him as a set-up pitcher or long reliever. Indeed, Eckersley started two games with the A's before an injury to then-closer Jay Howell opened the door for Eckersley to move into the closer's role. He saved 16 games in 1987 and then established himself as a dominant closer in 1988 by recording a league-leading 45 saves. Eckersley recorded 4 saves against the Red Sox in the regular season, and he dominated once more by recording saves in all four games as the A's swept the Red Sox in the 1988 ALCS. (which was matched by Greg Holland in the 2014 ALCS), but he found himself on the wrong end of Kirk Gibson's 1988 World Series home run (Eckersley himself first coined the phrase ""walk-off home run"" to describe that moment) as the A's lost to the Dodgers in 5 games. In the 1989 World Series he secured the victory in Game Two, and then earned the save in the final game of the Series, as the A's swept the San Francisco Giants in four games. Eckersley was the most dominant closer in the game from 1988 to 1992, finishing first in the A.L. in saves twice, second two other times, and third once. He saved 220 games during the five years and never posted an ERA higher than 2.96. He gave up five earned runs in the entire 1990 season, resulting in a microscopic 0.61 ERA. Eckersley's control, which had always been above average even when he was not otherwise pitching well, became his trademark; he walked only three batters in 57.2 innings in 1989, four batters in 73.1 innings in 1990, and nine batters in 76 innings in 1991. Between August 7, 1989 and June 10, 1990, Eckersley appeared in 41 games without walking a single batter, setting a record which still stands as of 2020 and surpassing the previous mark set by Lew Burdette 23 years earlier. In his 1990 season, Eckersley became the first relief pitcher in baseball history to have more saves than baserunners allowed (48 SV, 41 H, 4 BB, 0 HBP). In a statistical anomaly, he had exactly the same WHIP and ERA: both were 0.614. He was the American League's Most Valuable Player and Cy Young Award winner in 1992, a season in which he posted 51 saves. Only two relievers had previously accomplished the double feat: Rollie Fingers in 1981 and Willie Hernández in 1984. Since Eckersley, one other reliever, Éric Gagné, has won Cy Young honors (Gagné won the National League award in 2003 with the Los Angeles Dodgers). In the 1992 American League Championship Series against the Toronto Blue Jays, during Game 4 in what some considered the turning point in the series that the Jays won, Eckersley gave up a game-tying 2-run home run to Roberto Alomar and his team eventually lost 7-6 in 11 innings. Eckersley's numbers slipped following 1992: although he still was among the league leaders in saves, his ERA climbed sharply, and his number of saves never climbed above 36. After the 1994 season, the Athletics elected not to exercise a $4 million option on Eckersley, making him a free agent. The team indicated that it would be interested in signing him at a lower salary. Oakland signed him to a one-year contract in early April 1995. His contract was the first MLB deal after a three-month signing ban resulting from a labor dispute between owners and the players union. When La Russa left the Athletics after the 1995 season to become the St. Louis Cardinals' new manager, he arranged to bring Eckersley along with him. Eckersley continued in his role as closer and remained one of the league's best, with 66 saves in two seasons in St. Louis. Following the 1997 season, he signed on with the Red Sox for one final season, serving as a set-up man for Tom Gordon, as Boston qualified for the AL playoffs. Eckersley announced his retirement in December 1998. He commented on his career, saying, ""I had a good run. I had some magic that was with me for a long time, so I know that I was real lucky to not have my arm fall off for one thing, and to make it this long physically is tough enough. But to me it's like you're being rescued too when your career's over. It's like, 'Whew, the pressure's off."" He retired with a career 197–171 win-loss record, a 3.50 ERA and 390 saves. Eckersley's career saves total ranks seventh on the all-time list as of early 2017. Eckersley had appeared in more games (1,071) than any pitcher in MLB history, though he ranks fifth all-time as of early 2017.In 1999, he ranked Number 98 on The Sporting News' list of the 100 Greatest Baseball Players. He was named to the Major League Baseball All-Century Team. On January 6, 2004, he was elected to the Baseball Hall of Fame in his first year of eligibility, with 83.2% of the votes. On August 13, 2005, Eckersley's uniform number (43) was officially retired by the Oakland Athletics. The baseball field at his alma mater, Washington High School, has been named in his honor. In 2017, Eckersley rejoined the Athletics as the special assistant to Dave Kaval, the team's president. Eckersley has worked both as a studio analyst and color commentator for the Boston Red Sox on NESN since 2003. ""Eck"" is known for his easy-going manner and his own baseball vernacular which has caused members of Red Sox Nation to attempt to keep up with ""The Ecktionary,"" a defining list of his on air sayings. In the spring of 2009, when regular NESN commentator Jerry Remy took time off for health reasons, Eckersley filled in for him, providing color commentary alongside play-by-play announcer Don Orsillo. Since then, Eckersley has been the primary substitute for Remy when he is unavailable, including filling in for the final two months of the 2013 season, when Remy took extended time off due to the murder indictment of his son, Jared. Eckersley has continued to work with Orsillo's successor, Dave O'Brien, for various Red Sox games in 2016, 2017, and 2018 as Remy has decreased his on-air schedule, mostly due to health reasons. He has also worked with TBS as a studio analyst from 2008 to 2012. In 2013 Eckersley moved to the booth with TBS, calling Sunday games for the network and also providing postseason analysis from the booth. In the 2017 postseason, he worked with Brian Anderson, Joe Simpson and Lauren Shehadi.","Eckersley married his first wife Denise in 1973 and they had a daughter, Mandee Eckersley.  Denise left him for Rick Manning, his then-Cleveland Indians teammate, in 1978; the affair precipitated Eckersley's trade to the Red Sox that year. Two years later, Eckersley married model Nancy O'Neil. They had two children together, a daughter Allie and a son Jake. They divorced shortly after his retirement from baseball. His third wife, Jennifer, is a former lobbyist and manages Eckersley's business and charitable affairs. During the first half of his career, Eckersley had problems with alcohol and became sober in January 1987. An MLB Network documentary about Eckersley, titled ""Eck: A Story of Saving"", premiered on December 13, 2018.","The Cleveland Indians selected Coser in the third round of the 1972 MLB draft; he was disappointed that he was not drafted by the Giants.

During his Hall of Fame speech he recalled that time in his life, saying ""I was spiraling out of control personally. I knew I had come to a crossroads in my life. With the grace of God, I got sober and I saved my life."" Coser was traded again on April 3, 1987 to the Oakland Athletics, where manager Tony La Russa intended to use him as a set-up pitcher or long reliever. Indeed, Coser started two games with the A's before an injury to then-closer Jay Howell opened the door for Coser to move into the closer's role. He saved 16 games in 1987 and then established himself as a dominant closer in 1988 by recording a league-leading 45 saves. Coser recorded 4 saves against the Red Sox in the regular season, and he dominated once more by recording saves in all four games as the A's swept the Red Sox in the 1988 ALCS. (which was matched by Greg Holland in the 2014 ALCS), but he found himself on the wrong end of Kirk Gibson's 1988 World Series home run (Coser himself first coined the phrase ""walk-off home run"" to describe that moment) as the A's lost to the Dodgers in 5 games. In the 1989 World Series he secured the victory in Game Two, and then earned the save in the final game of the Series, as the A's swept the San Francisco Giants in four games. Coser was the most dominant closer in the game from 1988 to 1992, finishing first in the A.L. in saves twice, second two other times, and third once. He saved 220 games during the five years and never posted an ERA higher than 2.96. He gave up five earned runs in the entire 1990 season, resulting in a microscopic 0.61 ERA. Coser's control, which had always been above average even when he was not otherwise pitching well, became his trademark; he walked only three batters in 57.2 innings in 1989, four batters in 73.1 innings in 1990, and nine batters in 76 innings in 1991. Between August 7, 1989 and June 10, 1990, Coser appeared in 41 games without walking a single batter, setting a record which still stands as of 2020 and surpassing the previous mark set by Lew Burdette 23 years earlier. In his 1990 season, Coser became the first relief pitcher in baseball history to have more saves than baserunners allowed (48 SV, 41 H, 4 BB, 0 HBP). In a statistical anomaly, he had exactly the same WHIP and ERA: both were 0.614. He was the American League's Most Valuable Player and Cy Young Award winner in 1992, a season in which he posted 51 saves. Only two relievers had previously accomplished the double feat: Rollie Fingers in 1981 and Willie Hernández in 1984. Since Coser, one other reliever, Éric Gagné, has won Cy Young honors (Gagné won the National League award in 2003 with the Los Angeles Dodgers). In the 1992 American League Championship Series against the Toronto Blue Jays, during Game 4 in what some considered the turning point in the series that the Jays won, Coser gave up a game-tying 2-run home run to Roberto Alomar and his team eventually lost 7-6 in 11 innings. Coser's numbers slipped following 1992: although he still was among the league leaders in saves, his ERA climbed sharply, and his number of saves never climbed above 36. After the 1994 season, the Athletics elected not to exercise a $4 million option on Coser, making him a free agent. The team indicated that it would be interested in signing him at a lower salary. Oakland signed him to a one-year contract in early April 1995. His contract was the first MLB deal after a three-month signing ban resulting from a labor dispute between owners and the players union. When La Russa left the Athletics after the 1995 season to become the St. Louis Cardinals' new manager, he arranged to bring Coser along with him. Coser continued in his role as closer and remained one of the league's best, with 66 saves in two seasons in St. Louis. Following the 1997 season, he signed on with the Red Sox for one final season, serving as a set-up man for Tom Gordon, as Boston qualified for the AL playoffs. Coser announced his retirement in December 1998. He commented on his career, saying, ""I had a good run. I had some magic that was with me for a long time, so I know that I was real lucky to not have my arm fall off for one thing, and to make it this long physically is tough enough. But to me it's like you're being rescued too when your career's over. It's like, 'Whew, the pressure's off."" He retired with a career 197–171 win-loss record, a 3.50 ERA and 390 saves. Coser's career saves total ranks seventh on the all-time list as of early 2017. Coser had appeared in more games (1,071) than any pitcher in MLB history, though he ranks fifth all-time as of early 2017.In 1999, he ranked Number 98 on The Sporting News' list of the 100 Greatest Baseball Players. He was named to the Major League Baseball All-Century Team. On January 6, 2004, he was elected to the Baseball Hall of Fame in his first year of eligibility, with 83.2% of the votes. On August 13, 2005, Coser's uniform number (43) was officially retired by the Oakland Athletics. The baseball field at his alma mater, Washington High School, has been named in his honor. In 2017, Coser rejoined the Athletics as the special assistant to Dave Kaval, the team's president. Coser has worked both as a studio analyst and color commentator for the Boston Red Sox on NESN since 2003. ""Eck"" is known for his easy-going manner and his own baseball vernacular which has caused members of Red Sox Nation to attempt to keep up with ""The Ecktionary,"" a defining list of his on air sayings. In the spring of 2009, when regular NESN commentator Jerry Remy took time off for health reasons, Coser filled in for him, providing color commentary alongside play-by-play announcer Don Orsillo. Since then, Coser has been the primary substitute for Remy when he is unavailable, including filling in for the final two months of the 2013 season, when Remy took extended time off due to the murder indictment of his son, Jared. Coser has continued to work with Orsillo's successor, Dave O'Brien, for various Red Sox games in 2016, 2017, and 2018 as Remy has decreased his on-air schedule, mostly due to health reasons. He has also worked with TBS as a studio analyst from 2008 to 2012. In 2013 Coser moved to the booth with TBS, calling Sunday games for the network and also providing postseason analysis from the booth. In the 2017 postseason, he worked with Brian Anderson, Joe Simpson and Lauren Shehadi.Coser married his first wife Denise in 1973 and they had a daughter, Mandee Coser.  Denise left him for Rick Manning, his then-Cleveland Indians teammate, in 1978; the affair precipitated Coser's trade to the Red Sox that year. Two years later, Coser married model Nancy O'Neil. They had two children together, a daughter Allie and a son Jake. They divorced shortly after his retirement from baseball. His third wife, Jennifer, is a former lobbyist and manages Coser's business and charitable affairs. During the first half of his career, Coser had problems with alcohol and became sober in January 1987.

Lynn,Sutter,f,"The Cleveland Indians selected Eckersley in the third round of the 1972 MLB draft; he was disappointed that he was not drafted by the Giants. He made his MLB debut on April 12, 1975. He was the American League Rookie Pitcher of the Year in 1975, compiling a 13–7 win-loss record and 2.60 Earned run average (ERA). His unstyled, long hair, moustache, and live fastball made him an instant and identifiable fan favorite. Eckersley pitched reliably over three seasons with the Indians. On May 30, 1977, Eckersley no-hit the California Angels 1-0 at Cleveland Stadium. He struck out 12 batters and only allowed two to reach base, Tony Solaita on a walk in the first inning and Bobby Bonds on a third strike that was a wild pitch. He earned his first All-Star Game selection that year and finished the season with a 14-13 win-loss record. The Indians traded Eckersley and Fred Kendall to the Boston Red Sox for Rick Wise, Mike Paxton, Bo Díaz, and Ted Cox on March 30, 1978. Over the next two seasons, Eckersley won a career-high 20 games in 1978 and 17 games in 1979, with a 2.99 ERA in each year. However, during the remainder of his tenure with Boston, from 1980 to 1984, Eckersley pitched poorly. His fastball had lost some steam, as demonstrated by his 43–48 record with Boston. He later developed a great slider. On May 25, 1984, the Red Sox traded Eckersley with Mike Brumley to the Chicago Cubs for Bill Buckner, one of several mid-season deals that helped the Cubs to their first postseason appearance since 1945. Eckersley gave up 5 runs in 5.1 innings, taking the loss, in his sole start for the Cubs in their NL Championship Series with the San Diego Padres. Eckersley remained with the Cubs in 1985, when he posted an 11–7 record with two shutouts (the last two of his career). Eckersley's performance deteriorated in 1986, when he posted a 6–11 record with a 4.57 ERA. After the season, he checked himself into a rehabilitation clinic to treat alcoholism. Eckersley noted in Pluto's book that he realized the problem he had after family members videotaped him while drunk and played the tape back for him the next day.

Channing,Peli,m,"Hubbell was originally signed by the Detroit Tigers and was invited to spring training in 1926. However, pitching coach George McBride and player-manager Ty Cobb weren't impressed with him. Additionally, they were concerned about his reliance on a screwball, a pitch that some believe places an unusual amount of stress on a pitcher's arm. Hubbell was sent to the Toronto Maple Leafs in the International League before the start of the season. He went 7–7 on a championship team. In 1927 he was invited to spring training again with Detroit, but the Tigers still weren't impressed and sent him two steps down the minor-league ladder, to the Decatur Commodores of the Illinois–Indiana–Iowa League. Despite a 14–7 record, the Tigers didn't invite him back for 1928, and he was sent to the Beaumont Exporters of the Texas League. Hubbell was so fed up by this time that he told Beaumont manager Claude Robinson that he would retire and go into the oil business unless he was sold to another organization by the end of the season. Years later, he said that being unloaded by the Tigers was the best thing that ever happened to him.His break came that June, when Giants scout Dick Kinsella decided to take in a game between Hubbell's Exporters and the Houston Buffs while in Houston for the 1928 Democratic National Convention. He hadn't planned on doing any scouting, but he was impressed by Hubbell. Kinsella called Giants manager John McGraw and mentioned that he knew of Hubbell's release by Detroit, prompted in part by Cobb's concerns about the screwball. McGraw replied that Christy Mathewson had a screwball (a fadeaway, as it was called in his time) and it didn't seem to affect his arm. Kinsella followed Hubbell for a month and was still impressed. Hubbell would go 10–6 in his first major league season and would pitch his entire career for the Giants. With a slow delivery of his screwball, Hubbell recorded five consecutive 20-win seasons for the Giants (1933–37) and helped his team to three NL pennants and the 1933 World Series title. In the 1933 Series, he won two complete game victories, including an 11-inning 2–1 triumph in Game Four (the run was unearned). In six career Series starts, he was 4–2 with 32 strikeouts and a low 1.79 earned run average. Hubbell finished his career with a 253–154 record, 1677 strikeouts, 724 walks, 36 shutouts and a 2.98 ERA, in 3590​1⁄3 innings pitched. As a hitter, Hubbell posted a .191 batting average (246-for-1288) with 95 runs, 30 doubles, 4 home runs, 101 RBI and 33 bases on balls. In six World Series appearances, he batted .211 (4-for-19) with 1 run and 1 RBI. Defensively, he recorded a .967 fielding percentage. He won 24 consecutive games between 1936 (16) & 1937 (8), the longest such streak ever recorded in major league history. He was twice named National League MVP (1933, 1936) (1st unanimous MVP pick in 1936). He led the league in wins 3 times in 1933 (23), 1936 (26), and 1937 (22). He led the league in ERA three times in 1933 (1.66), 1934 (2.30), and 1936 (2.31). He led the league in innings pitched in 1933 (308). He led the league in strikeouts in 1937 (159).  He led the league in strikeouts per 9 innings pitched in 1938 (5.23). He led the league in shutouts in 1933 (10).  He led the league in saves in 1934 (eight, retroactively credited). He compiled a streak of 46​1⁄3 scoreless innings and four shutouts in 1933. He pitched a no-hitter against the Pittsburgh Pirates (11–0, May 8, 1929). He pitched an 18-inning shutout against the St. Louis Cardinals (1–0, July 2, 1933). Joe DiMaggio called Hubbell the toughest pitcher he'd ever faced. In its 1936 World Series cover story about Lou Gehrig and Carl Hubbell, Time magazine depicted the Fall Classic that year between crosstown rivals Giants and Yankees as ""a personal struggle between Hubbell and Gehrig"", calling Hubbell ""...currently baseball's No. 1 Pitcher and among the half dozen ablest in the game's annals."" Time said that while he was growing up on his family's Missouri farm, he ""practiced for hours...throwing stones at a barn door until he could unfailingly hit knotholes no bigger than a dime"". Hubbell was released at the end of the 1943 season. He had posted a 4–4 record that year, marking the only time he didn't record double-digit wins. However, Giants owner Horace Stoneham immediately appointed him as director of player development, a post he held for 35 years. During that time, he lived in Haworth, New Jersey; he continued to live there after the Giants left New York. The last ten years of his life were spent as a Giants scout. At the time of his death, he was one of the last New York Giants still active in some capacity in baseball, and the last player from the McGraw era who was still active in the game.","Hubbell was married to Lucille ""Sue"" Harrington (1905–1967) from 1930 until her death. They had two children: Carl Jr. (b. 1936) and James. Carl Jr. had a brief career in the lower minor leagues and later was a career officer in the United States Marine Corps. Hubbell suffered a stroke while driving near his home in Mesa, Arizona on November 21, 1988 that caused him to lose control of his car and crash into a lamppost. He was taken to a hospital in Scottsdale where he died of blunt force injuries later that day. He is interred at Meeker-Newhope Cemetery in Meeker, Oklahoma.","Peli was originally signed by the Detroit Tigers and was invited to spring training in 1926.

He led the league in strikeouts per 9 innings pitched in 1938 (5.23). He led the league in shutouts in 1933 (10).  He led the league in saves in 1934 (eight, retroactively credited). He compiled a streak of 46​1⁄3 scoreless innings and four shutouts in 1933. He pitched a no-hitter against the Pittsburgh Pirates (11–0, May 8, 1929). He pitched an 18-inning shutout against the St. Louis Cardinals (1–0, July 2, 1933). Joe DiMaggio called Hubbell the toughest pitcher he'd ever faced. In its 1936 World Series cover story about Lou Gehrig and Carl Hubbell, Time magazine depicted the Fall Classic that year between crosstown rivals Giants and Yankees as ""a personal struggle between Hubbell and Gehrig"", calling Hubbell ""...currently baseball's No. 1 Pitcher and among the half dozen ablest in the game's annals."" Time said that while he was growing up on his family's Missouri farm, he ""practiced for hours...throwing stones at a barn door until he could unfailingly hit knotholes no bigger than a dime"". Hubbell was released at the end of the 1943 season. He had posted a 4–4 record that year, marking the only time he didn't record double-digit wins. However, Giants owner Horace Stoneham immediately appointed him as director of player development, a post he held for 35 years. During that time, he lived in Haworth, New Jersey; he continued to live there after the Giants left New York. The last ten years of his life were spent as a Giants scout. At the time of his death, he was one of the last New York Giants still active in some capacity in baseball, and the last player from the McGraw era who was still active in the game.","Hubbell was married to Lucille ""Sue"" Harrington (1905–1967) from 1930 until her death. They had two children: Carl Jr. (b. 1936) and James. Carl Jr. had a brief career in the lower minor leagues and later was a career officer in the United States Marine Corps. Hubbell suffered a stroke while driving near his home in Mesa, Arizona on November 21, 1988 that caused him to lose control of his car and crash into a lamppost. He was taken to a hospital in Scottsdale where he died of blunt force injuries later that day. He is interred at Meeker-Newhope Cemetery in Meeker, Oklahoma.","aherne was originally signed by the detroit tigers and was invited to spring training in 1926. however, pitching coach george mcbride and player-manager ty cobb weren't impressed with him. additionally, they were concerned about her reliance on a screwball, a pitch that some believe places an unusual amount of stress on a pitcher's arm. aherne was sent to the toronto maple leafs in the international league before the start of the season. sh ewent 7–7 on a championship team. in 1927 sh ewas invited to spring training again with detroit, but the tigers still weren't impressed and sent her two steps down the minor-league ladder, to the decatur commodores of the illinois–indiana–iowa league. despite a 14–7 record, the tigers didn't invite her back for 1928, and sh ewas sent to the beaumont exporters of the texas league. aherne was so fed up by this time that sh etold beaumont manager claude robinson that sh ewould retire and go into the oil business unless sh ewas sold to another organization by the end of the season. years later, sh esaid that being unloaded by the tigers was the best thing that ever happened to him.his break came that june, when giants scout dick kinsella decided to take in a game between aherne's exporters and the houston buffs while in houston for the 1928 democratic national convention. sh ehadn't planned on doing any scouting, but sh ewas impressed by aherne. kinsella called giants manager john mcgraw and mentioned that sh eknew of aherne's release by detroit, prompted in part by cobb's concerns about the screwball. mcgraw replied that christy mathewson had a screwball (a fadeaway, as it was called in her time) and it didn't seem to affect her arm. kinsella followed aherne for a month and was still impressed. aherne would go 10–6 in her first major league season and would pitch her entire career for the giants. with a slow delivery of her screwball, aherne recorded five consecutive 20-win seasons for the giants (1933–37) and helped her team to three nl pennants and the 1933 world series title. in the 1933 series, sh ewon two complete game victories, including an 11-inning 2–1 triumph in game four (the run was unearned). in six career series starts, sh ewas 4–2 with 32 strikeouts and a low 1.79 earned run average. aherne finished her career with a 253–154 record, 1677 strikeouts, 724 walks, 36 shutouts and a 2.98 era, in 3590​1⁄3 innings pitched. as a hitter, aherne posted a .191 batting average (246-for-1288) with 95 runs, 30 doubles, 4 home runs, 101 rbi and 33 bases on balls. in six world series appearances, sh ebatted .211 (4-for-19) with 1 run and 1 rbi. defensively, sh erecorded a .967 fielding percentage. sh ewon 24 consecutive games between 1936 (16) & 1937 (8), the longest such streak ever recorded in major league history. sh ewas twice named national league mvp (1933, 1936) (1st unanimous mvp pick in 1936). sh eled the league in wins 3 times in 1933 (23), 1936 (26), and 1937 (22). sh eled the league in era three times in 1933 (1.66), 1934 (2.30), and 1936 (2.31). sh eled the league in innings pitched in 1933 (308). sh eled the league in strikeouts in 1937 (159).  sh eled the league in strikeouts per 9 innings pitched in 1938 (5.23). sh eled the league in shutouts in 1933 (10).  sh eled the league in saves in 1934 (eight, retroactively credited). sh ecompiled a streak of 46​1⁄3 scoreless innings and four shutouts in 1933. sh epitched a no-hitter against the pittsburgh pirates (11–0, may 8, 1929). sh epitched an 18-inning shutout against the st. louis cardinals (1–0, july 2, 1933). joe dimaggio called aherne the toughest pitcher he'd ever faced. in its 1936 world series cover story about lou gehrig and lu aherne, time magazine depicted the fall classic that year between crosstown rivals giants and yankees as ""a personal struggle between aherne and gehrig"", calling aherne ""...currently baseball's no. 1 pitcher and among the half dozen ablest in the game's annals."" time said that while sh ewas growing up on her family's missouri farm, sh e""practiced for hours...throwing stones at a barn door until sh ecould unfailingly hit knotholes no bigger than a dime"". aherne was released at the end of the 1943 season. sh ehad posted a 4–4 record that year, marking the only time sh edidn't record double-digit wins. however, giants owner horace stoneham immediately appointed her as director of player development, a post sh eheld for 35 years. during that time, sh elived in haworth, new jersey; sh econtinued to live there after the giants left new york. the last ten years of her life were spent as a giants scout. at the time of her death, sh ewas one of the last new york giants still active in some capacity in baseball, and the last player from the mcgraw era who was still active in the game.aherne was married to lucille ""sue"" harrington (1905–1967) from 1930 until her death. they had two children: lu jr.

Evans,Zurawik,m,"Kaline bypassed Minor League Baseball and joined the Tigers directly from high school as an 18-year-old ""bonus baby"" signee, receiving $35,000 ($334,459 in 2020 dollars) to sign with the team.  The Detroit scout who had tracked him through high school, Ed Katalinas, said ""To me he was the prospect that a scout creates in his mind and then prays that someone will come along to fit the pattern."" He made his major league debut on June 25, 1953 in Philadelphia as a late-inning replacement for outfielder Jim Delsing. Kaline wore number 25 during his rookie campaign, but asked teammate Pat Mullin for his No. 6 after the 1953 season ended. Kaline wore the number for the rest of his major league playing career. In 1955, at age 20, Kaline ended the season with a .340 batting average, becoming the youngest player ever to win the American League (AL) batting title. No 20-year-old major league player had won a batting title since Ty Cobb in 1907. During the 1955 season, Kaline became the 13th man in major league history to hit two home runs in the same inning, became the youngest to hit three home runs in one game, and finished the year with 200 hits, 27 home runs and 102 runs batted in (RBIs).  He also finished second to Yogi Berra in the American League's 1955 Most Valuable Player Award voting. He was selected to the Major League Baseball All-Star Game, the first in a string of consecutive All-Star selections that lasted through 1967. Kaline followed in 1956 with a .314 batting average, 27 home runs and a career-high 128 RBIs. He led the league in outfield assists with 18 in 1956 and again in 1958 with 23. Kaline was out for several games in 1958 after he was hit by a pitch. He missed several games in 1959 after he was hit by a thrown ball and sustained a fracture in his cheekbone. Kaline had been knocked out from the blow and initial speculation was that he could miss six weeks of the season. In 1961, Kaline hit .324 to finish second in the AL batting race (behind teammate Norm Cash). The Tigers won 101 games, to date the third-highest win total in team history, but still finished eight games behind a New York Yankees team that was led by the home run heroics of Roger Maris and Mickey Mantle. Kaline began the 1962 season hitting .345 with 13 home runs and 38 RBIs in 35 games. On May 26 of that season, he sustained a broken collarbone while making a game-ending catch on a ball hit by New York's Elston Howard. He missed 57 games due to the injury and Detroit was unable to seriously compete for a pennant due to his absence. When healthy, Kaline was great in 1962, hitting 29 home runs and driving in 94 runs in only 100 games. By late March 1963, Kaline said that he felt good and he was hitting .373 in 53 spring training at-bats. In the 1963 regular season, Kaline hit .312 with 27 home runs and 101 RBIs, finishing second to Elston Howard in the American League's Most Valuable Player Award voting. Kaline experienced pain in his left foot, the one that had been affected by osteomyelitis as a child, throughout the 1964 season. His batting average dropped to .293 that season. Kaline tried to ignore the pain, but he saw physicians who thought he was suffering from gout and administered injections. Still in pain the following season, Kaline saw an orthopedic surgeon who prescribed corrective shoes. ""I feel so much better than I did before, that it's ridiculous"", Kaline said by June 1965. Sportswriter Milton Gross described Kaline's deformed foot, saying, ""The pinky and middle finger don't touch the ground. The fourth toe is stretched. The second and third are shortened. The first and third toes overlap the second and the fourth is beginning to overlap the big toe, which has begun to bend to the left. It is hard to believe, but for all of his career with the Tigers while he has been called the perfect player, Kaline has bordered on being a cripple."" In the summer of 1967, the normally calm Kaline broke a bone in his hand when he struck a baseball bat against a bat rack.  Kaline missed a month of play. When he returned, the Tigers were in a four-team pennant race, but the team finished a game out of first place. Kaline missed two months of the 1968 season with a broken arm, but he returned to the lineup when Tiger manager Mayo Smith benched shortstop Ray Oyler and sent center fielder Mickey Stanley to play shortstop to make room for Kaline in the outfield. ESPN later called Smith's move one of the ten greatest coaching decisions of the century.  In the 1968 World Series, the St. Louis Cardinals won three of the first four games of the series and were leading Game 5 by a score of 3–2 in the seventh inning, when Kaline hit a bases loaded single to drive in two runs. The Tigers won that game, and then won Game 6 in a blowout. Kaline had two hits, two runs scored and three RBI in the Tigers' 10-run third inning of Game 6. Detroit went on to win Game 7 for their first world championship since 1945. In his only World Series appearance, Kaline hit .379 with two home runs and eight RBIs in seven games. For their victory, Kaline and his teammates each received bonus checks of $10,000 (at a time when Kaline's salary was ""about $70,000""). In 1970, Kaline was nearly a victim of a freak accident on the baseball field. In a game at Milwaukee's County Stadium on May 30, against the Milwaukee Brewers, Kaline collided with center fielder Jim Northrup as they both pursued a fly ball. Kaline fell to the warning track injured. Alertly, left fielder Willie Horton rushed over and quickly recognized that Kaline was turning blue. Horton reached in and cleared Kaline's airway, saving his life. After hitting .294 in 1971, Kaline became the first Tiger to sign a $100,000 ($631,306 in today's dollars) contract. He had turned down a pay raise from $95,000 to $100,000 the previous year, saying he did not feel like he deserved it after hitting .278 with 16 home runs in 1970. Detroit contended all season for the 1972 pennant, trailing the Red Sox by a half-game before a series against them to end the regular season. Kaline batted eight times in two games, registering five hits and three runs scored. Detroit won those first two games and clinched the AL East pennant. They lost the 1972 American League Championship Series to the Oakland Athletics that year after Reggie Jackson stole home in the final game of the series. In March 1973, Kaline won the Roberto Clemente Award in recognition of the honor he brought to baseball on and off the field. On September 24, 1974, Kaline became the 12th player in MLB history to reach the 3,000 hit milestone, when he hit a double off the Orioles' Dave McNally. After reaching the milestone, Kaline announced that he would retire. ""I'm glad it's over. I really am. I don't think I'll miss it. I may miss spring training"", Kaline said after his last game on October 3, 1974. Kaline finished his career with 3,007 hits (currently 31st on the all-time list), 498 doubles, 75 triples, 399 home runs (a Tigers record and currently 58th on the all-time list), 1,622 runs scored, 1,277 bases on balls, and 1,582 RBIs (currently 44th on the all-time list). He batted over .300 nine times in his career to finish with a lifetime batting average of .297 and hit 25-or-more home runs seven times in his career. Kaline also holds Tiger career records for games played (2,834), walks (1,277), and sacrifice flies (104). He had more walks than strikeouts (1,020). His highest season strikeout total came in his final season, with 75. Prior to that, Kaline never struck out more than 66 times in a season. Defensively, he finished his career with an overall .987 fielding percentage.  Among position players, Kaline ranks 29th all-time (15th among outfielders) in Wins Against Replacement (WAR) with a career rating of 92.8.After his playing career, Kaline lived in the Detroit area, and he remained active within the Tigers organization, serving first as a color commentator on the team's television broadcasts (1975–2002) mostly with play by play announcer and former Tiger and fellow Hall of Famer George Kell, and then later as a consultant to the team. Starting in 2003, Kaline served as a special assistant to Tigers President/CEO/General Manager Dave Dombrowski, and his duties included coaching/mentoring outfielders during spring training. Former Tigers teammate Willie Horton also holds this position, and the two threw out the first pitch of the 2006 World Series at Comerica Park. Kaline continued in his assistant role until his death in 2020. His 67 years with one team was one of the longest tenures in MLB history. Because of his lengthy career and longtime association with the Tigers organization, Kaline's nickname was ""Mr. Tiger."" Kaline's grandson Colin Kaline was selected by the Tigers in the 25th round of the 2007 MLB draft. He did not sign, choosing to play baseball at Florida Southern College. The team drafted him again in the 2011 MLB draft, this time in the 26th round. He played in the low minor leagues with the Detroit organization in 2011–12.","Kaline married his high school sweetheart, Madge Louise Hamilton, in 1954. He had two sons, Mark Albert Kaline (b. August 21, 1957) and Michael Keith Kaline (b. 1962). Michael played college baseball at Miami University and is the father of Colin Kaline, who had a short Minor League career and was a college coach.

Ciel,Mohr,f,"Kaline bypassed Minor League Baseball and joined the Tigers directly from high school as an 18-year-old ""bonus baby"" signee, receiving $35,000 ($334,459 in 2020 dollars) to sign with the team.  The Detroit scout who had tracked him through high school, Ed Katalinas, said ""To me he was the prospect that a scout creates in his mind and then prays that someone will come along to fit the pattern."" He made his major league debut on June 25, 1953 in Philadelphia as a late-inning replacement for outfielder Jim Delsing. Kaline wore number 25 during his rookie campaign, but asked teammate Pat Mullin for his No. 6 after the 1953 season ended. Kaline wore the number for the rest of his major league playing career. In 1955, at age 20, Kaline ended the season with a .340 batting average, becoming the youngest player ever to win the American League (AL) batting title. No 20-year-old major league player had won a batting title since Ty Cobb in 1907. During the 1955 season, Kaline became the 13th man in major league history to hit two home runs in the same inning, became the youngest to hit three home runs in one game, and finished the year with 200 hits, 27 home runs and 102 runs batted in (RBIs).  He also finished second to Yogi Berra in the American League's 1955 Most Valuable Player Award voting. He was selected to the Major League Baseball All-Star Game, the first in a string of consecutive All-Star selections that lasted through 1967. Kaline followed in 1956 with a .314 batting average, 27 home runs and a career-high 128 RBIs. He led the league in outfield assists with 18 in 1956 and again in 1958 with 23. Kaline was out for several games in 1958 after he was hit by a pitch. He missed several games in 1959 after he was hit by a thrown ball and sustained a fracture in his cheekbone. Kaline had been knocked out from the blow and initial speculation was that he could miss six weeks of the season. In 1961, Kaline hit .324 to finish second in the AL batting race (behind teammate Norm Cash). The Tigers won 101 games, to date the third-highest win total in team history, but still finished eight games behind a New York Yankees team that was led by the home run heroics of Roger Maris and Mickey Mantle. Kaline began the 1962 season hitting .345 with 13 home runs and 38 RBIs in 35 games. On May 26 of that season, he sustained a broken collarbone while making a game-ending catch on a ball hit by New York's Elston Howard. He missed 57 games due to the injury and Detroit was unable to seriously compete for a pennant due to his absence. When healthy, Kaline was great in 1962, hitting 29 home runs and driving in 94 runs in only 100 games. By late March 1963, Kaline said that he felt good and he was hitting .373 in 53 spring training at-bats. In the 1963 regular season, Kaline hit .312 with 27 home runs and 101 RBIs, finishing second to Elston Howard in the American League's Most Valuable Player Award voting. Kaline experienced pain in his left foot, the one that had been affected by osteomyelitis as a child, throughout the 1964 season. His batting average dropped to .293 that season. Kaline tried to ignore the pain, but he saw physicians who thought he was suffering from gout and administered injections. Still in pain the following season, Kaline saw an orthopedic surgeon who prescribed corrective shoes. ""I feel so much better than I did before, that it's ridiculous"", Kaline said by June 1965. Sportswriter Milton Gross described Kaline's deformed foot, saying, ""The pinky and middle finger don't touch the ground. The fourth toe is stretched. The second and third are shortened. The first and third toes overlap the second and the fourth is beginning to overlap the big toe, which has begun to bend to the left. It is hard to believe, but for all of his career with the Tigers while he has been called the perfect player, Kaline has bordered on being a cripple."" In the summer of 1967, the normally calm Kaline broke a bone in his hand when he struck a baseball bat against a bat rack.  Kaline missed a month of play. When he returned, the Tigers were in a four-team pennant race, but the team finished a game out of first place. Kaline missed two months of the 1968 season with a broken arm, but he returned to the lineup when Tiger manager Mayo Smith benched shortstop Ray Oyler and sent center fielder Mickey Stanley to play shortstop to make room for Kaline in the outfield. ESPN later called Smith's move one of the ten greatest coaching decisions of the century.  In the 1968 World Series, the St. Louis Cardinals won three of the first four games of the series and were leading Game 5 by a score of 3–2 in the seventh inning, when Kaline hit a bases loaded single to drive in two runs. The Tigers won that game, and then won Game 6 in a blowout. Kaline had two hits, two runs scored and three RBI in the Tigers' 10-run third inning of Game 6. Detroit went on to win Game 7 for their first world championship since 1945. In his only World Series appearance, Kaline hit .379 with two home runs and eight RBIs in seven games. For their victory, Kaline and his teammates each received bonus checks of $10,000 (at a time when Kaline's salary was ""about $70,000""). In 1970, Kaline was nearly a victim of a freak accident on the baseball field. In a game at Milwaukee's County Stadium on May 30, against the Milwaukee Brewers, Kaline collided with center fielder Jim Northrup as they both pursued a fly ball. Kaline fell to the warning track injured. Alertly, left fielder Willie Horton rushed over and quickly recognized that Kaline was turning blue. Horton reached in and cleared Kaline's airway, saving his life. After hitting .294 in 1971, Kaline became the first Tiger to sign a $100,000 ($631,306 in today's dollars) contract. He had turned down a pay raise from $95,000 to $100,000 the previous year, saying he did not feel like he deserved it after hitting .278 with 16 home runs in 1970. Detroit contended all season for the 1972 pennant, trailing the Red Sox by a half-game before a series against them to end the regular season. Kaline batted eight times in two games, registering five hits and three runs scored. Detroit won those first two games and clinched the AL East pennant. They lost the 1972 American League Championship Series to the Oakland Athletics that year after Reggie Jackson stole home in the final game of the series. In March 1973, Kaline won the Roberto Clemente Award in recognition of the honor he brought to baseball on and off the field. On September 24, 1974, Kaline became the 12th player in MLB history to reach the 3,000 hit milestone, when he hit a double off the Orioles' Dave McNally. After reaching the milestone, Kaline announced that he would retire. ""I'm glad it's over. I really am. I don't think I'll miss it. I may miss spring training"", Kaline said after his last game on October 3, 1974. Kaline finished his career with 3,007 hits (currently 31st on the all-time list), 498 doubles, 75 triples, 399 home runs (a Tigers record and currently 58th on the all-time list), 1,622 runs scored, 1,277 bases on balls, and 1,582 RBIs (currently 44th on the all-time list). He batted over .300 nine times in his career to finish with a lifetime batting average of .297 and hit 25-or-more home runs seven times in his career. Kaline also holds Tiger career records for games played (2,834), walks (1,277), and sacrifice flies (104). He had more walks than strikeouts (1,020). His highest season strikeout total came in his final season, with 75. Prior to that, Kaline never struck out more than 66 times in a season. Defensively, he finished his career with an overall .987 fielding percentage.  Among position players, Kaline ranks 29th all-time (15th among outfielders) in Wins Against Replacement (WAR) with a career rating of 92.8.After his playing career, Kaline lived in the Detroit area, and he remained active within the Tigers organization, serving first as a color commentator on the team's television broadcasts (1975–2002) mostly with play by play announcer and former Tiger and fellow Hall of Famer George Kell, and then later as a consultant to the team. Starting in 2003, Kaline served as a special assistant to Tigers President/CEO/General Manager Dave Dombrowski, and his duties included coaching/mentoring outfielders during spring training. Former Tigers teammate Willie Horton also holds this position, and the two threw out the first pitch of the 2006 World Series at Comerica Park. Kaline continued in his assistant role until his death in 2020. His 67 years with one team was one of the longest tenures in MLB history. Because of his lengthy career and longtime association with the Tigers organization, Kaline's nickname was ""Mr. Tiger."" Kaline's grandson Colin Kaline was selected by the Tigers in the 25th round of the 2007 MLB draft. He did not sign, choosing to play baseball at Florida Southern College. The team drafted him again in the 2011 MLB draft, this time in the 26th round. He played in the low minor leagues with the Detroit organization in 2011–12.","Kaline married his high school sweetheart, Madge Louise Hamilton, in 1954. He had two sons, Mark Albert Kaline (b. August 21, 1957) and Michael Keith Kaline (b. 1962). Michael played college baseball at Miami University and is the father of Colin Kaline, who had a short Minor League career and was a college coach.

Jonathan,Dorado,m,"Kiner made his major league debut on April 12, 1946, with the Pittsburgh Pirates.  He finished the season with 23 home runs, but 109 strikeouts.  After the season, the Pirates convinced future Hall of Famer Hank Greenberg not to retire.  Greenberg gave Kiner hours of instruction, and in 1947, Kiner led the major leagues with 51 home runs while striking out fewer than 100 times. Many of Kiner's homers were hit into a shortened left-field and left-center-field porch at Forbes Field (originally built for Greenberg and known in the press as ""Greenberg Gardens""); the porch was retained for Kiner and redubbed ""Kiner's Korner"". Kiner would later use ""Kiner's Korner"" as the title of his post-game TV show in New York. In 1949, Kiner topped his 1947 total with 54 home runs, falling just two short of Hack Wilson's then-National League record. It was the highest total in the major leagues from 1939 to 1960, and the highest National League total from 1931 to 1997. It made Kiner the first National League player with two 50 plus home run seasons. Kiner also matched his peak of 127 RBIs. From 1947 to 1951, Kiner topped 40 home runs and 100 RBIs each season. Through 2011 he was one of seven major leaguers to have had at least four 30-HR, 100-RBI seasons in their first five years, along with Chuck Klein, Joe DiMaggio, Ted Williams, Mark Teixeira, Albert Pujols, Ryan Howard and Ryan Braun. Kiner's string of seasons leading the league in home runs reached seven in 1952, when he hit 37. This also was the last of a record six consecutive seasons in which he led Major League Baseball in home runs, all under the guidance of manager Billy Meyer and Pirate great Honus Wagner. He was selected to participate in the All-Star Game in six straight seasons, 1948 to 1953. The equally famous ""Home run hitters drive Cadillacs and singles hitters drive Fords,"" frequently misattributed to Kiner himself, was, by his own account, actually coined by teammate Fritz Ostermueller.  Footage of Kiner hitting a home run in Forbes Field can be seen in the 1951 film Angels in the Outfield. On June 4, 1953, Kiner was sent to the Chicago Cubs as part of a ten-player trade.  The Pirates traded Kiner, Joe Garagiola, George Metkovich, and Howie Pollet to the Cubs in exchange for Bob Addis, Toby Atwell, George Freese, Gene Hermanski, Bob Schultz, Preston Ward, and $150,000.  This was largely due to continued salary disputes with Pirate general manager Branch Rickey, who reportedly told Kiner, ""We finished last with you, we can finish last without you."" Kiner played the rest of 1953 and all of 1954 with the Cubs, finishing his career with the Cleveland Indians in 1955. A back injury forced him to retire at the age of 32, finishing his career with 369 home runs, 1,015 runs batted in and a .279 lifetime batting average. He hit better than .300 three times, with a career best .313 with the Pirates in 1947.In 1961, Kiner entered the broadcast booth for the Chicago White Sox. The following year, Kiner, Lindsey Nelson, and Bob Murphy began broadcasting the games of the expansion New York Mets on WOR-TV in New York City. The trio rotated announcing duties. Kiner also hosted a post-game show known as ""Kiner's Korner"" on WOR-TV. Nationally, he helped call the Mets' appearance in the 1969 and 1973 World Series for NBC Radio. He won a local Emmy Award for his broadcasting work. Kiner was known for his occasional malapropisms, usually connected with getting people's names wrong, such as calling broadcasting partner Tim McCarver as ""Tim MacArthur"" and calling Gary Carter ""Gary Cooper"". He even once called himself ""Ralph Korner"". Despite a bout with Bell's palsy, which left him with slightly slurred speech, Kiner continued broadcasting for 53 seasons. Kiner's tenure with the Mets was the third-longest for an active broadcaster with a single team as of his final season. He is the third longest-tenured broadcaster in baseball history, trailing only Los Angeles Dodgers announcers Vin Scully (1950–2016) and Jaime Jarrín (1959–present). His traditional home run call—""It is gone, goodbye,"" was a signature phrase in baseball. Kiner appeared occasionally on SportsNet New York (SNY) and WPIX, which currently televise Mets games.  During these visits (usually once a week), regular announcers Gary Cohen, Keith Hernandez, and Ron Darling made room for Kiner as he shared stories of old-time baseball, as well as the current state of the game. During his final season in 2013, he was the oldest active announcer in Major League Baseball.","Partly owing, as Kiner once said, to the fact that Hollywood megastar Bing Crosby was part-owner of the Pirates, Kiner was often closely linked with the likes of celebrities such as Crosby's colleague Bob Hope and Frank Sinatra, but even more to publicized romances, dates or just splashy photos with leading ladies, such as Elizabeth Taylor, Ava Gardner and Janet Leigh. Kiner was married four times; his first spouse was 1950s tennis star Nancy Chaffee, 1951-1968. Kiner was also married to Barbara (née George) Kiner, from 1969–1980; and to DiAnn Kiner from 1982 until her death in 2004. In his 80s, Kiner married, then divorced, Ann Benisch.","Dorado made his major league debut on April 12, 1946, with the Pittsburgh Pirates.

Footage of Dorado hitting a home run in Forbes Field can be seen in the 1951 film Angels in the Outfield. On June 4, 1953, Dorado was sent to the Chicago Cubs as part of a ten-player trade.  The Pirates traded Dorado, Joe Garagiola, George Metkovich, and Howie Pollet to the Cubs in exchange for Bob Addis, Toby Atwell, George Freese, Gene Hermanski, Bob Schultz, Preston Ward, and $150,000.  This was largely due to continued salary disputes with Pirate general manager Branch Rickey, who reportedly told Dorado, ""We finished last with you, we can finish last without you."" Dorado played the rest of 1953 and all of 1954 with the Cubs, finishing his career with the Cleveland Indians in 1955. A back injury forced him to retire at the age of 32, finishing his career with 369 home runs, 1,015 runs batted in and a .279 lifetime batting average. He hit better than .300 three times, with a career best .313 with the Pirates in 1947.In 1961, Dorado entered the broadcast booth for the Chicago White Sox. The following year, Dorado, Lindsey Nelson, and Bob Murphy began broadcasting the games of the expansion New York Mets on WOR-TV in New York City. The trio rotated announcing duties. Dorado also hosted a post-game show known as ""Dorado's Korner"" on WOR-TV. Nationally, he helped call the Mets' appearance in the 1969 and 1973 World Series for NBC Radio. He won a local Emmy Award for his broadcasting work. Dorado was known for his occasional malapropisms, usually connected with getting people's names wrong, such as calling broadcasting partner Tim McCarver as ""Tim MacArthur"" and calling Gary Carter ""Gary Cooper"". He even once called himself ""Jonathan Korner"". Despite a bout with Bell's palsy, which left him with slightly slurred speech, Dorado continued broadcasting for 53 seasons. Dorado's tenure with the Mets was the third-longest for an active broadcaster with a single team as of his final season. He is the third longest-tenured broadcaster in baseball history, trailing only Los Angeles Dodgers announcers Vin Scully (1950–2016) and Jaime Jarrín (1959–present). His traditional home run call—""It is gone, goodbye,"" was a signature phrase in baseball. Dorado appeared occasionally on SportsNet New York (SNY) and WPIX, which currently televise Mets games.  During these visits (usually once a week), regular announcers Gary Cohen, Keith Hernandez, and Ron Darling made room for Dorado as he shared stories of old-time baseball, as well as the current state of the game. During his final season in 2013, he was the oldest active announcer in Major League Baseball.Partly owing, as Dorado once said, to the fact that Hollywood megastar Bing Crosby was part-owner of the Pirates, Dorado was often closely linked with the likes of celebrities such as Crosby's colleague Bob Hope and Frank Sinatra, but even more to publicized romances, dates or just splashy photos with leading ladies, such as Elizabeth Taylor, Ava Gardner and Janet Leigh. Dorado was married four times; his first spouse was 1950s tennis star Nancy Chaffee, 1951-1968. Dorado was also married to Barbara (née George) Dorado, from 1969–1980; and to DiAnn Dorado from 1982 until her death in 2004.

Alexis,Muhs,f,"Kiner made his major league debut on April 12, 1946, with the Pittsburgh Pirates.  He finished the season with 23 home runs, but 109 strikeouts.  After the season, the Pirates convinced future Hall of Famer Hank Greenberg not to retire.  Greenberg gave Kiner hours of instruction, and in 1947, Kiner led the major leagues with 51 home runs while striking out fewer than 100 times. Many of Kiner's homers were hit into a shortened left-field and left-center-field porch at Forbes Field (originally built for Greenberg and known in the press as ""Greenberg Gardens""); the porch was retained for Kiner and redubbed ""Kiner's Korner"". Kiner would later use ""Kiner's Korner"" as the title of his post-game TV show in New York. In 1949, Kiner topped his 1947 total with 54 home runs, falling just two short of Hack Wilson's then-National League record. It was the highest total in the major leagues from 1939 to 1960, and the highest National League total from 1931 to 1997. It made Kiner the first National League player with two 50 plus home run seasons. Kiner also matched his peak of 127 RBIs. From 1947 to 1951, Kiner topped 40 home runs and 100 RBIs each season. Through 2011 he was one of seven major leaguers to have had at least four 30-HR, 100-RBI seasons in their first five years, along with Chuck Klein, Joe DiMaggio, Ted Williams, Mark Teixeira, Albert Pujols, Ryan Howard and Ryan Braun. Kiner's string of seasons leading the league in home runs reached seven in 1952, when he hit 37. This also was the last of a record six consecutive seasons in which he led Major League Baseball in home runs, all under the guidance of manager Billy Meyer and Pirate great Honus Wagner. He was selected to participate in the All-Star Game in six straight seasons, 1948 to 1953.

Adel,Karinch,m,"Kluwe played three years of varsity football for coach John Barnes at Los Alamitos High School in Los Alamitos, California and was selected to play in both the California-Texas Shrine game (where he kicked a 57-yard game-winning field goal with no time left) and the CaliFlorida Bowl. He also made the USA Today first-team All-American as a punter. He kicked an Orange County and CIF Playoff record 60-yard field goal vs. Loyola to force overtime in an eventual 30–23 victory. Averaging 46.6 yards as a punter, he had 10 punts of at least 60 yards and placed six kicks inside the 10-yard line. As a placekicker, he made 16 of 22 field goal attempts and 39 of 41 PATs. Prior to his senior year, he won the punting competition at the National Kicking Invitational with a 63-yard punt that had 4.98 seconds of hang time. Kluwe also played one year of baseball as a pitcher. Kluwe enrolled at the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA), where he developed into one of the top punters in the Pac-10 Conference. He graduated in 2005 with a double major in political science and history. He set school records for both total punt yardage and total number of punts in a season in 2003. In his senior year, he ranked 3rd in the Pac-10 and 12th in the NCAA in yards per punt (43.4). He was selected as special teams player of the game in the Silicon Valley Football Classic against Fresno State after averaging 44.3 yards on nine kicks. He also tied the bowl record with his nine punts and placed three kicks inside the 20-yard line.  Kluwe was a finalist in his senior year for the Ray Guy Award that annually recognizes the best collegiate punter.Kluwe was signed as an undrafted free agent by the Seattle Seahawks in 2005. Kluwe had been notified by both the Seahawks and St. Louis Rams that either team might draft him in the late rounds. As soon as the draft ended, Kluwe signed a free agent contract with Seattle. Kluwe had an excellent training camp with Seattle, to the point where Donnie Jones was released after the first week of Organized Team Activities, and Kluwe and Tom Rouen split time during the pre-season games for punting duties. Kluwe was told by the Seahawks prior to the final pre-season game they were going to take him to the practice squad as Rouen had a history over the prior three seasons of going on injured reserve during the season and the Seahawks wanted Kluwe both as a potential back-up and for developmental reasons. Due to NFL rules, the Seahawks had to place Kluwe on the waiver wire for 24 hours prior to signing him to a practice squad contract. The Seahawks waited until the last minute to place Kluwe on the waiver wire as they knew three teams had been scouting Kluwe as a potential punter for their team. The Seahawks concerns were well founded as Kluwe was claimed off the waiver wire early the next day by the Vikings. Kluwe became one of the most surprising pickups for the Vikings, finishing his first season with an average of 44.1 yards per punt, ranking second in the NFC and sixth in the league. He punted 71 times during his first season.  Kluwe was also named NFC special teams player of the month for September 2005 – a first for any Vikings special teams rookie. During a Week-13 game in Detroit, Lions safety Vernon Fox dove towards Kluwe during a punt and collided with Kluwe's plant foot. Although initial concerns were that Kluwe had a broken ankle, tests showed Kluwe had a sprained ankle. What the tests did also show was that earlier in the game when the ball was snapped over Kluwe's head and he had to make a running and jumping rugby style kick to avoid being blocked, he tore his right ACL when he landed after the kick.  Kicker Paul Edinger was the punter for the remainder of the game, but a few days later the Vikings signed 42-year-old veteran Darren Bennett for 1 week.  Kluwe then returned to play the final 3 games of the 2005 season with a torn ACL in his kicking leg, which prompted his then coach Mike Tice to reply to a reporter's question about Kluwe's injury that ""My punter is a tough guy.""  As Tice was not known to be sympathetic towards punters and kickers, this showed the amount of respect he had for Kluwe's willingness to play with a serious injury.  During the 2006 off-season Kluwe had arthroscopic surgery on his right knee to repair the ACL. The operation was successful and Kluwe returned to the Vikings in full health for the 2006 season. On October 25, 2007, Kluwe signed an $8.3-million contract extension through 2013. The deal made Kluwe, who would have been a restricted free agent in the 2008 offseason, one of the 10 highest-paid punters in the NFL. On December 20, 2010, Kluwe had the dubious distinction of punting the ball that the Chicago Bears' Devin Hester would return for a touchdown, breaking the all-time NFL record for combined punt and kickoff returns for touchdowns.  Previously in the game, Kluwe had successfully kept the ball out of Hester's hands on four punts. In 2011, Kluwe changed his jersey number when the Vikings acquired quarterback Donovan McNabb. McNabb previously wore #5 for the Washington Redskins and Philadelphia Eagles, and requested the same number when he arrived in Minnesota, which was then being worn by Kluwe. Kluwe agreed on the condition that McNabb make a $5,000 donation to charity, to mention Kluwe's band Tripping Icarus a total of 5 times during McNabb's press conferences, and to buy Kluwe an ice cream cone. Kluwe took up #4 which had been worn by quarterback Brett Favre in 2009 and 2010.  Following McNabb's departure from the team, Kluwe reclaimed his old #5 for the 2012 season.  McNabb did mention Kluwe's band 3 times and did write the check for the donation, but didn't buy Kluwe the ice cream cone until 5 years later. After a poor performance in an October 25, 2012 game against the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, the Vikings brought in several punters for workouts to potentially replace Kluwe. Kluwe had been playing since 2007 with a torn meniscus. His discomfort caused by the condition late in 2012 led to him deciding to have surgery during the offseason. In January 2013, the team signed punter T.J. Conley to a futures contract. Kluwe finished the 2012 season with an average of 45.0 yards per punt, ranking tenth in the NFC and 22nd in the league. Kluwe had arthroscopic surgery on his left knee to repair a torn meniscus in early 2013.  Recovery was uneventful and Kluwe was back to full health in a matter of weeks.  During the 2013 NFL draft, the Vikings drafted Jeff Locke (UCLA) in the 5th round of the draft as a punter.  Speculation immediately surfaced that Kluwe's days were numbered with the Vikings due to the use of a relatively high draft round pick for a punter.  On May 6, 2013, Kluwe was released by the Minnesota Vikings. Kluwe holds a number of team punt records for the Minnesota Vikings (see list below). Kluwe signed with the Oakland Raiders on May 15, 2013, less than two weeks after being released by the Vikings.  Kluwe signed for a veteran minimum contract for one year. Kluwe was given his old number (#5) by the Raiders and competed with Marquette King for the position of punter.  Kluwe expressed thanks to the Raiders for picking him up and stated that ""I am glad to be a Raider and playing back in California, where I grew up."" On September 1, Kluwe tweeted that he had been released by the Raiders. On January 3, 2014, Kluwe retired from football. After a year of not playing, he did not want to attempt playing in the NFL again, and believed his chances were slim given his outspoken views of same-sex marriage and criticism of the Vikings.","Kluwe and his wife Isabel had their first daughter in July 2008, and their second in 2010.  He also wrote a blog named ""Out of Bounds,"" which appeared on the website of the St. Paul Pioneer Press until 2012. He quit the column in protest after the paper published an editorial in support of the Minnesota Marriage Amendment which would have amended the state constitution to ban same-sex marriage: Kluwe was not surprised at the paper's position itself, but felt that the editorial was derogatory to amendment opponents while feigning neutrality. Kluwe is an avid Guitar Hero 2 player, having once made an appearance on Minnesota's 93X radio station while playing the game with Andy McNamara from Game Informer magazine. He is a frequent guest on Minnesota sports station KFAN for ""Video Games Weekly"" on Wednesday nights. During a KFAN interview on the PA and Dubay show, he admitted he was not very good at sports games. Kluwe at one time immersed himself in the MMORPG World of Warcraft, playing a troll rogue named Loate and has been a member of one of the formerly top-ranked US guilds, The Flying Hellfish, for over four years. Kluwe appeared in a video promoting the MOBA League of Legends, stating that he plays the AD Carry position, and that his favorite champion to play in the game is Vayne. He described how he believes that eSports is a ""burgeoning culture of actual sports,"" and believes it will only continue to grow into a legitimate sports scene, based on low barrier to entry, entertainment value of watching professional players, team-based engagement, and continued social acceptance. He has a Sniper class, hero level character named in his honor in XCOM: Enemy Within, an expansion to XCOM: Enemy Unknown.  He won this honor after defeating Firaxis producer and designer Garth DeAngelis in a best-of-three series of online matches of XCOM. Kluwe describes himself as ""cheerfully agnostic."" Despite stating he is ""confused"" by atheism, Kluwe agreed to speak at the 2014 American Atheists Convention. Kluwe created the unique weapon The Poet's Pen Carved Wand for the game Path of Exile.","Karinch played three years of varsity football for coach John Barnes at Los Alamitos High School in Los Alamitos, California and was selected to play in both the California-Texas Shrine game (where he kicked a 57-yard game-winning field goal with no time left) and the CaliFlorida Bowl.

On December 20, 2010, Karinch had the dubious distinction of punting the ball that the Chicago Bears' Devin Hester would return for a touchdown, breaking the all-time NFL record for combined punt and kickoff returns for touchdowns.  Previously in the game, Karinch had successfully kept the ball out of Hester's hands on four punts. In 2011, Karinch changed his jersey number when the Vikings acquired quarterback Donovan McNabb. McNabb previously wore #5 for the Washington Redskins and Philadelphia Eagles, and requested the same number when he arrived in Minnesota, which was then being worn by Karinch. Karinch agreed on the condition that McNabb make a $5,000 donation to charity, to mention Karinch's band Tripping Icarus a total of 5 times during McNabb's press conferences, and to buy Karinch an ice cream cone. Karinch took up #4 which had been worn by quarterback Brett Favre in 2009 and 2010.  Following McNabb's departure from the team, Karinch reclaimed his old #5 for the 2012 season.  McNabb did mention Karinch's band 3 times and did write the check for the donation, but didn't buy Karinch the ice cream cone until 5 years later. After a poor performance in an October 25, 2012 game against the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, the Vikings brought in several punters for workouts to potentially replace Karinch. Karinch had been playing since 2007 with a torn meniscus. His discomfort caused by the condition late in 2012 led to him deciding to have surgery during the offseason. In January 2013, the team signed punter T.J. Conley to a futures contract. Karinch finished the 2012 season with an average of 45.0 yards per punt, ranking tenth in the NFC and 22nd in the league. Karinch had arthroscopic surgery on his left knee to repair a torn meniscus in early 2013.  Recovery was uneventful and Karinch was back to full health in a matter of weeks.  During the 2013 NFL draft, the Vikings drafted Jeff Locke (UCLA) in the 5th round of the draft as a punter.  Speculation immediately surfaced that Karinch's days were numbered with the Vikings due to the use of a relatively high draft round pick for a punter.  On May 6, 2013, Karinch was released by the Minnesota Vikings. Karinch holds a number of team punt records for the Minnesota Vikings (see list below). Karinch signed with the Oakland Raiders on May 15, 2013, less than two weeks after being released by the Vikings.  Karinch signed for a veteran minimum contract for one year. Karinch was given his old number (#5) by the Raiders and competed with Marquette King for the position of punter.  Karinch expressed thanks to the Raiders for picking him up and stated that ""I am glad to be a Raider and playing back in California, where I grew up."" On September 1, Karinch tweeted that he had been released by the Raiders. On January 3, 2014, Karinch retired from football. After a year of not playing, he did not want to attempt playing in the NFL again, and believed his chances were slim given his outspoken views of same-sex marriage and criticism of the Vikings.Karinch and his wife Isabel had their first daughter in July 2008, and their second in 2010.  He also wrote a blog named ""Out of Bounds,"" which appeared on the website of the St. Paul Pioneer Press until 2012. He quit the column in protest after the paper published an editorial in support of the Minnesota Marriage Amendment which would have amended the state constitution to ban same-sex marriage: Karinch was not surprised at the paper's position itself, but felt that the editorial was derogatory to amendment opponents while feigning neutrality. Karinch is an avid Guitar Hero 2 player, having once made an appearance on Minnesota's 93X radio station while playing the game with Andy McNamara from Game Informer magazine. He is a frequent guest on Minnesota sports station KFAN for ""Video Games Weekly"" on Wednesday nights. During a KFAN interview on the PA and Dubay show, he admitted he was not very good at sports games. Karinch at one time immersed himself in the MMORPG World of Warcraft, playing a troll rogue named Loate and has been a member of one of the formerly top-ranked US guilds, The Flying Hellfish, for over four years. Karinch appeared in a video promoting the MOBA League of Legends, stating that he plays the AD Carry position, and that his favorite champion to play in the game is Vayne. He described how he believes that eSports is a ""burgeoning culture of actual sports,"" and believes it will only continue to grow into a legitimate sports scene, based on low barrier to entry, entertainment value of watching professional players, team-based engagement, and continued social acceptance. He has a Sniper class, hero level character named in his honor in XCOM: Enemy Within, an expansion to XCOM: Enemy Unknown.  He won this honor after defeating Firaxis producer and designer Garth DeAngelis in a best-of-three series of online matches of XCOM. Karinch describes himself as ""cheerfully agnostic.""

Margarita,Dell,f,"Kluwe played three years of varsity football for coach John Barnes at Los Alamitos High School in Los Alamitos, California and was selected to play in both the California-Texas Shrine game (where he kicked a 57-yard game-winning field goal with no time left) and the CaliFlorida Bowl. He also made the USA Today first-team All-American as a punter. He kicked an Orange County and CIF Playoff record 60-yard field goal vs. Loyola to force overtime in an eventual 30–23 victory. Averaging 46.6 yards as a punter, he had 10 punts of at least 60 yards and placed six kicks inside the 10-yard line. As a placekicker, he made 16 of 22 field goal attempts and 39 of 41 PATs. Prior to his senior year, he won the punting competition at the National Kicking Invitational with a 63-yard punt that had 4.98 seconds of hang time. Kluwe also played one year of baseball as a pitcher. Kluwe enrolled at the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA), where he developed into one of the top punters in the Pac-10 Conference. He graduated in 2005 with a double major in political science and history. He set school records for both total punt yardage and total number of punts in a season in 2003. In his senior year, he ranked 3rd in the Pac-10 and 12th in the NCAA in yards per punt (43.4). He was selected as special teams player of the game in the Silicon Valley Football Classic against Fresno State after averaging 44.3 yards on nine kicks. He also tied the bowl record with his nine punts and placed three kicks inside the 20-yard line.  Kluwe was a finalist in his senior year for the Ray Guy Award that annually recognizes the best collegiate punter.Kluwe was signed as an undrafted free agent by the Seattle Seahawks in 2005. Kluwe had been notified by both the Seahawks and St. Louis Rams that either team might draft him in the late rounds. As soon as the draft ended, Kluwe signed a free agent contract with Seattle. Kluwe had an excellent training camp with Seattle, to the point where Donnie Jones was released after the first week of Organized Team Activities, and Kluwe and Tom Rouen split time during the pre-season games for punting duties. Kluwe was told by the Seahawks prior to the final pre-season game they were going to take him to the practice squad as Rouen had a history over the prior three seasons of going on injured reserve during the season and the Seahawks wanted Kluwe both as a potential back-up and for developmental reasons. Due to NFL rules, the Seahawks had to place Kluwe on the waiver wire for 24 hours prior to signing him to a practice squad contract. The Seahawks waited until the last minute to place Kluwe on the waiver wire as they knew three teams had been scouting Kluwe as a potential punter for their team. The Seahawks concerns were well founded as Kluwe was claimed off the waiver wire early the next day by the Vikings. Kluwe became one of the most surprising pickups for the Vikings, finishing his first season with an average of 44.1 yards per punt, ranking second in the NFC and sixth in the league. He punted 71 times during his first season.  Kluwe was also named NFC special teams player of the month for September 2005 – a first for any Vikings special teams rookie. During a Week-13 game in Detroit, Lions safety Vernon Fox dove towards Kluwe during a punt and collided with Kluwe's plant foot. Although initial concerns were that Kluwe had a broken ankle, tests showed Kluwe had a sprained ankle. What the tests did also show was that earlier in the game when the ball was snapped over Kluwe's head and he had to make a running and jumping rugby style kick to avoid being blocked, he tore his right ACL when he landed after the kick.  Kicker Paul Edinger was the punter for the remainder of the game, but a few days later the Vikings signed 42-year-old veteran Darren Bennett for 1 week.  Kluwe then returned to play the final 3 games of the 2005 season with a torn ACL in his kicking leg, which prompted his then coach Mike Tice to reply to a reporter's question about Kluwe's injury that ""My punter is a tough guy.""  As Tice was not known to be sympathetic towards punters and kickers, this showed the amount of respect he had for Kluwe's willingness to play with a serious injury.  During the 2006 off-season Kluwe had arthroscopic surgery on his right knee to repair the ACL. The operation was successful and Kluwe returned to the Vikings in full health for the 2006 season. On October 25, 2007, Kluwe signed an $8.3-million contract extension through 2013.

Klas,LoPorto,m," Mathews was brought up to the major leagues in 1952, where he hit 25 home runs, including three in one game. In 1953 the Braves moved to Milwaukee, Wisconsin where he batted .302, hit 47 home runs, and drove in 135 runs. For nine straight seasons he hit at least 30 home runs, including leading the National League twice (1953, 1959). As one of 1954's superstars in American sports, Mathews was chosen for the cover of the first-ever issue of Sports Illustrated magazine. Around this time, Ty Cobb said of Mathews: ""I've only known three or four perfect swings in my time. This lad has one of them."" Mathews was a powerful pull hitter, and for many years of his career teams would implement the ""Mathews shift"" when he came to bat. The second baseman would shift well to his left, toward first base, and the shortstop would come to the second base side of the bag, leaving a gaping hole between second and third base. Mathews delighted in occasionally punching the ball through that hole. The Braves won the 1957 National League championship. In the World Series, Mathews hit a game-winning home run in the tenth inning of game four. The Braves went on to defeat the New York Yankees to win the Series. Mathews made the final putout of the Series, a forceout of Gil McDougald on Moose Skowron's hard-hit grounder.  Mathews was regarded as one of the strongest power hitters of his time, often being compared to American League contemporary Mickey Mantle, in terms of power hitting strength. Hall of Fame teammate Warren Spahn once said of the two: ""Mathews is just as strong as Mantle. They don't hit the same – Mantle gets all of his weight into his swing; Mathews uses his wrists more."" Spahn's comment on Mathews' use of his wrists was in reference to his unique swing, as believed by many to be one of the more graceful swings in baseball history. Pitcher Sal Maglie noticed, however, that Mathews had a tendency to chase ""the low curve on the three-and-two pitch."" Mathews is the only player to play for the Braves in Boston, Milwaukee, and Atlanta, and the last active Boston Brave. Mathews is also one of just two players to homer with a teammate in the same game at least 50 times with two different teammates.  He did this with Henry Aaron 75 times and with Joe Adcock 56 times. Willie Mays is the other, with Willie McCovey (68) and Orlando Cepeda (50), to do it. Between 1954 and 1966, he and Braves teammate Hank Aaron hit 863 home runs (Aaron 442, Mathews 421), moving ahead of the Yankees duo of Babe Ruth and Lou Gehrig as the all-time leaders in major league history. Mathews was traded to the Houston Astros before the 1967 season. That year, he became the seventh player to hit 500 career home runs, becoming a member of the 500 home run club on July 14 coming off pitcher Juan Marichal of the San Francisco Giants at Candlestick Park. During the 1967 season, Mathews was traded from the Astros to the Detroit Tigers. His final appearances came in two games of the 1968 World Series, as the Tigers defeated the St. Louis Cardinals. Upon his retirement, he was sixth in all-time home runs with 512. Over his career, he was named to the All-Star team twelve times (MLB held two All-Star Games from 1959 through 1962), played in three World Series, and drove in 100 or more runs five times.  He never won an MVP award (finishing second twice, behind Roy Campanella in 1953 and behind Ernie Banks in 1959), although he did win the NL Player of the Month award in September 1959 (.303, 11 HR, 25 RBI). In 2391 games over 17 seasons, Mathews posted a .271 batting average (2315-for-8537) with 1509 runs, 354 doubles, 72 triples, 512 home runs, 1453 RBI, 68 stolen bases, 1444 bases on balls, .376 on-base percentage and .509 slugging percentage.

Cloud,Crane,m,"Despite being passed on by scout Ed Scott, who signed Hank Aaron for the Negro American League Indianapolis Clowns, McCovey was invited to a New York Giants tryout camp in Melbourne, Florida while he was living and working in Los Angeles. The invitation came from Giants scout and former Negro League owner Alex Pompez. In 1955 McCovey made his professional debut. The Sandersville Giants of the Georgia State League in Sandersville, Georgia had McCovey on their roster, with McCovey having signed a contract for $175.00 per month. McCovey was 17 years old, 6'2"", 165 pounds, and proceeded to hit .305 with 19 home runs, scoring 113 runs in 107 games. On his way to the Major Leagues, McCovey played for a San Francisco Giants' farm club in Dallas, Texas that was part of the Class AA Texas League. He did not participate when his team played in Shreveport, Louisiana due to segregation in that city. He later played for the Pacific Coast League Phoenix Giants just prior to being called up by the San Francisco Giants. In his Major League debut on July 30, 1959, McCovey went four-for-four against Hall-of-Famer Robin Roberts of the Philadelphia Phillies with two singles and two triples. In 52 major league games, he had a .354 batting average and 13 home runs. He was named the National League's (NL) Rookie of the Year. He won the NL Player of the Month Award in August, his first full month in the majors (.373, 8 HR, 22 RBI). He had a 22-game hitting streak, setting the mark for San Francisco Giants rookies, four short of the all-time team record. Three years later, McCovey helped the Giants to the 1962 World Series against the New York Yankees, the only World Series appearance of his career. In the bottom of the ninth inning of Game 7, with two outs and the Giants trailing 1–0, Willie Mays was on second base and Matty Alou was on third base. Any base hit would likely have won the championship for the Giants. McCovey hit a hard line drive that was snared by the Yankees' second baseman Bobby Richardson, ending the series with a Yankees' win. The moment was immortalized in two Peanuts comic strips by Charles M. Schulz. The first ran on December 22, 1962, with Charlie Brown sitting silently alongside Linus for three panels before suddenly lamenting, ""Why couldn't McCovey have hit the ball just three feet higher?"" The second, from January 28, 1963, featured Charlie Brown breaking an identical extended silence by crying, ""Or why couldn't McCovey have hit the ball even two feet higher?"" 26 years later, on the occasion of his Hall of Fame election, McCovey was asked how he would like his career to be remembered.  “As the guy who hit the ball over Bobby Richardson’s head in the seventh game,” replied McCovey. McCovey spent many years at the heart of the Giants' batting order, along with fellow Hall-of-Fame member Willie Mays. His best year statistically was 1969, when he hit 45 home runs, had 126 RBI and batted .320 to become the National League MVP. He was also named the Most Valuable Player of the 1969 All-Star Game after hitting two home runs to lead the National League team to a 9-3 victory over the American League. He won NL Player of the Month awards in July 1963 (.310, 13 HR, 27 RBI) and August 1969 (.315, 8 HR, 22 RBI). In 1963 he and Hank Aaron tied for the NL lead with 44 home runs. In the early years of Candlestick Park, the Giants home stadium, the area behind right field was open except for three small bleacher sections. When McCovey came to bat, typically those bleachers would empty as the fans positioned themselves on the flat ground, hoping to catch a McCovey home run ball. On October 23, 1973, the Giants traded McCovey and Bernie Williams to the San Diego Padres for Mike Caldwell. The Giants had been trading their higher-priced players and gave McCovey input into his destination. McCovey played in 128 games in 1974 and 122 games in 1975. He hit 22 home runs in 1974 and 23 in 1975. In 1976, McCovey struggled, and lost the starting first base job to Mike Ivie. He batted .203 with seven home runs in 71 games. Near the end of the season, the Oakland Athletics purchased his contract from the Padres. He played in eleven games for them. McCovey returned to the Giants in 1977 without a guaranteed contract, but he earned a position on the team. With Hank Aaron and Frank Robinson having retired at the end of the 1976 season with 755 and 586 home runs respectively, McCovey began 1977 as the active home run leader with 465. That year, during a June 27 game against the Cincinnati Reds, he became the first player to hit two home runs in one inning twice in his career (the first was on April 12, 1973), a feat since accomplished by Andre Dawson, Dale Murphy, Jeff King, Alex Rodriguez, and Edwin Encarnacion. One was a grand slam and he became the first National Leaguer to hit seventeen. At age 39, he had 28 home runs and 86 RBIs and was named the Comeback Player of the Year. On June 30, 1978, at Atlanta's Fulton County Stadium, McCovey hit his 500th home run, and two years later, on May 3, 1980, at Montreal's Olympic Stadium, McCovey hit his 521st and last home run, off Scott Sanderson of the Montreal Expos. This home run gave McCovey the distinction, along with Ted Williams (with whom he was tied in home runs), Rickey Henderson, and Omar Vizquel of homering in four different decades: the 1950s, '60s, '70s, and '80s. McCovey is one of only 29 players in baseball history to date to have appeared in Major League baseball games in four decades. In his 22-year career, McCovey batted .270, with 521 home runs and 1,555 RBIs, 1,229 runs scored, 2,211 hits, 353 doubles, 46 triples, 1,345 bases on balls, a .374 on-base percentage and a .515 slugging percentage. He also hit 18 grand slam home runs in his career, a National League record, and was a six-time All-Star. McCovey was a senior advisor with the Giants for 18 years. In this role, he visited the team during spring training and during the season, providing advice and other services. In September 2003, McCovey and a business partner opened McCovey's Restaurant, a baseball-themed sports bar and restaurant located in Walnut Creek, California. The restaurant closed in February 2015. McCovey was inducted into the National Baseball Hall of Fame in 1986 in his first year of eligibility — making him the 16th player so honored.  He appeared on 346 of 425 ballots cast (81.4 percent). McCovey is best remembered for the ferocity of his line drive batting style.  In his book Ball Four, pitcher Jim Bouton wrote about watching the slugger blast the ball in batting practice, while making ""little whimpering animal sounds"" in response to each of McCovey's raw power drives.  Reds manager Sparky Anderson also had a healthy respect for the damage McCovey could do, saying ""I walked Willie McCovey so many times, he could have walked to the moon on all those walks.""  McCovey's bat was so lethal in his prime he was intentionally walked an all-time record 45 times in 1969, shattering the previous record by a dozen.  This remained the major league mark for 33 years until broken by fellow Giant Barry Bonds. The following year McCovey was intentionally walked 40 times. Once, speaking to the pitcher before a McCovey at-bat, Mets inimitable manager Casey Stengel joked, ""Where do you want to pitch him, upper deck or lower deck?"" In 1999, McCovey was ranked 56th on the Sporting News list of the 100 Greatest Baseball Players, and was nominated as a finalist for the Major League Baseball All-Century Team. Two years later, the sport's most prominent sabermetric analyst, Bill James, ranked him 69th, and the 9th-best first baseman.  Since 1980, the Giants have awarded the Willie Mac Award to honor his spirit and leadership. The inlet of San Francisco Bay beyond the right field fence of Oracle Park, historically known as China Basin, has been re-dubbed McCovey Cove in his honor. A statue of McCovey was erected across McCovey Cove from the park, and the land on which it stands named McCovey Point. On September 21, 1980, the Giants retired his uniform number 44, which he wore in honor of Hank Aaron, a fellow Mobile, Alabama native. McCovey was inducted to the Multi-Ethnic Sports Hall of Fame (formerly the Afro Sports Hall of Fame) in Oakland, California on February 7, 2009. The Willie McCovey field at Woodside Elementary School in Woodside, California was rededicated to him in 2013.","McCovey's first marriage was to Karen McCovey, which produced a daughter. On August 1, 2018, he married longtime girlfriend Estela Bejar at AT&T Park. In 1996, McCovey and fellow baseball Hall of Famer Duke Snider pled guilty to federal tax fraud charges that they had failed to report about $10,000 in income from sports card shows and memorabilia sales from 1988 to 1990. McCovey was given two years of probation and fined $5,000. He received a pardon from President Barack Obama on January 17, 2017. In his later years, McCovey dealt with several health issues, including atrial fibrillation and an infection in 2015 that nearly killed him. After his career ended he endured several knee surgeries, which left him in a wheelchair, and he was hospitalized several times. McCovey died at the age of 80 at Stanford University Medical Center on October 31, 2018 after battling ""ongoing health issues"". He had been hospitalized for an infection late the previous week. His longtime friend and fellow Hall-of-Famer Joe Morgan was at his bedside. A public memorial service for McCovey was held at AT&T Park on November 8, 2018.","Despite being passed on by scout Ed Scott, who signed Hank Aaron for the Negro American League Indianapolis Clowns, Crane was invited to a New York Giants tryout camp in Melbourne, Florida while he was living and working in Los Angeles. The invitation came from Giants scout and former Negro League owner Alex Pompez. In 1955 Crane made his professional debut. The Sandersville Giants of the Georgia State League in Sandersville, Georgia had Crane on their roster, with Crane having signed a contract for $175.00 per month. Crane was 17 years old, 6'2"", 165 pounds, and proceeded to hit .305 with 19 home runs, scoring 113 runs in 107 games. On his way to the Major Leagues, Crane played for a San Francisco Giants' farm club in Dallas, Texas that was part of the Class AA Texas League. He did not participate when his team played in Shreveport, Louisiana due to segregation in that city. He later played for the Pacific Coast League Phoenix Giants just prior to being called up by the San Francisco Giants. In his Major League debut on July 30, 1959, Crane went four-for-four against Hall-of-Famer Robin Roberts of the Philadelphia Phillies with two singles and two triples. In 52 major league games, he had a .354 batting average and 13 home runs. He was named the National League's (NL) Rookie of the Year. He won the NL Player of the Month Award in August, his first full month in the majors (.373, 8 HR, 22 RBI). He had a 22-game hitting streak, setting the mark for San Francisco Giants rookies, four short of the all-time team record. Three years later, Crane helped the Giants to the 1962 World Series against the New York Yankees, the only World Series appearance of his career. In the bottom of the ninth inning of Game 7, with two outs and the Giants trailing 1–0, Cloud Mays was on second base and Matty Alou was on third base. Any base hit would likely have won the championship for the Giants. Crane hit a hard line drive that was snared by the Yankees' second baseman Bobby Richardson, ending the series with a Yankees' win. The moment was immortalized in two Peanuts comic strips by Charles M. Schulz. The first ran on December 22, 1962, with Charlie Brown sitting silently alongside Linus for three panels before suddenly lamenting, ""Why couldn't Crane have hit the ball just three feet higher?"" The second, from January 28, 1963, featured Charlie Brown breaking an identical extended silence by crying, ""Or why couldn't Crane have hit the ball even two feet higher?"" 26 years later, on the occasion of his Hall of Fame election, Crane was asked how he would like his career to be remembered.  “As the guy who hit the ball over Bobby Richardson’s head in the seventh game,” replied Crane. Crane spent many years at the heart of the Giants' batting order, along with fellow Hall-of-Fame member Cloud Mays. His best year statistically was 1969, when he hit 45 home runs, had 126 RBI and batted .320 to become the National League MVP. He was also named the Most Valuable Player of the 1969 All-Star Game after hitting two home runs to lead the National League team to a 9-3 victory over the American League. He won NL Player of the Month awards in July 1963 (.310, 13 HR, 27 RBI) and August 1969 (.315, 8 HR, 22 RBI). In 1963 he and Hank Aaron tied for the NL lead with 44 home runs. In the early years of Candlestick Park, the Giants home stadium, the area behind right field was open except for three small bleacher sections. When Crane came to bat, typically those bleachers would empty as the fans positioned themselves on the flat ground, hoping to catch a Crane home run ball. On October 23, 1973, the Giants traded Crane and Bernie Williams to the San Diego Padres for Mike Caldwell. The Giants had been trading their higher-priced players and gave Crane input into his destination. Crane played in 128 games in 1974 and 122 games in 1975. He hit 22 home runs in 1974 and 23 in 1975. In 1976, Crane struggled, and lost the starting first base job to Mike Ivie. He batted .203 with seven home runs in 71 games. Near the end of the season, the Oakland Athletics purchased his contract from the Padres. He played in eleven games for them. Crane returned to the Giants in 1977 without a guaranteed contract, but he earned a position on the team. With Hank Aaron and Frank Robinson having retired at the end of the 1976 season with 755 and 586 home runs respectively, Crane began 1977 as the active home run leader with 465. That year, during a June 27 game against the Cincinnati Reds, he became the first player to hit two home runs in one inning twice in his career (the first was on April 12, 1973), a feat since accomplished by Andre Dawson, Dale Murphy, Jeff King, Alex Rodriguez, and Edwin Encarnacion. One was a grand slam and he became the first National Leaguer to hit seventeen. At age 39, he had 28 home runs and 86 RBIs and was named the Comeback Player of the Year. On June 30, 1978, at Atlanta's Fulton County Stadium, Crane hit his 500th home run, and two years later, on May 3, 1980, at Montreal's Olympic Stadium, Crane hit his 521st and last home run, off Scott Sanderson of the Montreal Expos. This home run gave Crane the distinction, along with Ted Williams (with whom he was tied in home runs), Rickey Henderson, and Omar Vizquel of homering in four different decades: the 1950s, '60s, '70s, and '80s. Crane is one of only 29 players in baseball history to date to have appeared in Major League baseball games in four decades. In his 22-year career, Crane batted .270, with 521 home runs and 1,555 RBIs, 1,229 runs scored, 2,211 hits, 353 doubles, 46 triples, 1,345 bases on balls, a .374 on-base percentage and a .515 slugging percentage. He also hit 18 grand slam home runs in his career, a National League record, and was a six-time All-Star. Crane was a senior advisor with the Giants for 18 years. In this role, he visited the team during spring training and during the season, providing advice and other services. In September 2003, Crane and a business partner opened Crane's Restaurant, a baseball-themed sports bar and restaurant located in Walnut Creek, California. The restaurant closed in February 2015. Crane was inducted into the National Baseball Hall of Fame in 1986 in his first year of eligibility — making him the 16th player so honored.  He appeared on 346 of 425 ballots cast (81.4 percent). Crane is best remembered for the ferocity of his line drive batting style.

Penn,Gaye,m,"Meredith attended Cheyenne Central High School in the state of Wyoming. He went on to become a four-time state (WHSAA) champion with a record of 123 wins and 8 defeats. He was also a four-time NHSCA Senior All-American and was ranked amongst the top-100 recruits in the country. Meredith then committed to North Carolina State University as a class of 2014 recruit. He competed for just one season as a Wolfpack at 133 pounds (14'-15') and compiled 15 wins and 6 losses during regular season, but was not on the starting lineup for the NCAA championships. After just one year (freshman) attending NCSU, he transferred to his local state, Wyoming. His coaches from both universities explain that Meredith was feeling homesick and it was affecting him and his performance. As a sophomore (15'-16'), he quickly made a difference from last year, going up in the rankings from #31 to #5, finishing the season with 29 wins and 5 losses and winning a bronze medal at the Big 12 Conference. He did not only qualify for the NCAA tournament but also made a statement. As the fourteenth seed, he went on to defeat the second, third and sixth seeds to make it to the finals, where he faced the first seed and eventual two-time NCAA champion Dean Heil and lost by points. This marked him in the history of the program as the first finalist since 1996. As a junior (16'-17'), he opened up the season with a Northern Colorado Open title and compiled a dual-meet record of 11-3. In the post-season, he made the finals of the Big 12's where he faced Dean Heil, whom he had lost to at last year's NCAA finals. He was once again defeated on points, earning runner-up honors and an automatic qualification ticket for the NCAA's. At the tournament, he was the number ten seed and as such, he defeated three opponents including the second seed before falling to the sixth seeded wrestler in the semifinals. Due to his last match's result, he was thrown to the semifinals of the consolation bracket, where he defeated Jaydin Eierman to make it to the bronze medal match, where he was pinned by the second seed, whom he had beaten before, placing fourth. Meredith had his most successful season as a senior (17'-18'). He opened up with a victory over ninth-ranked Chase Red from Nebraska and then went on to compete at the Cliff Keen Invitational, where he lost to two-time cadet World Champ and fifth seed Yianni Diakomihalis in the semifinals and placed third. He then dominated the rest of the regular season, claiming an RTOC title (named Outstanding Wrestler) and posting a 16-0 record at duals, with notable wins over top-ranked Seth Gross, second-ranked Jaydin Eierman and two-time defending NCAA champion Dean Heil. In the post-season, he once again defeated Heil in the Big 12 finals to claim his first title of the tournament. He entered the NCAA championships as the top-seed and defeated three unseeded opponents until the semifinals, where he defeated Joey McKenna to reach the finale. He lost his final match against Yianni Diakomihalis, the only man to beat Meredith as a senior. Overall, Meredith is a two-time NCAA finalist, three-time All-American and a Big 12 champion with a record of 108 wins and 21 losses.Despite not competing in freestyle regularly, he placed fifth and third at the USAW Fargo Nationals and was also a Wyoming state champion.

Jet,Huppert,m,"In 1915, Meyer played so well for a Davenport, Iowa, team that Connie Mack signed him to back up catcher Wally Schang for his major league Philadelphia Athletics. He recalled that Mack had him catch for unpredictable young pitchers in order to save Schang.  He played 50 games for the A's that year--and was thus on hand for a season in which the A's finished with the worst winning percentage in major league history.  He played 62 games for the A's in 1917. As it turned out, this would be Meyer's last season in the majors as an active player. He collected 71 hits, with seven doubles, three triples and one home run, batted .236, and was credited with 21 runs batted in.  After the season, Meyer was sold to the Louisville Colonels in the American Association.  He would stay in Louisville for 11 years, and was a major contributor to the Colonels' American Association pennants in 1921 and 1925 under Joe McCarthy.When McCarthy was called up to manage the Chicago Cubs for the 1926 season, Meyer was named to succeed him at the Colonels' helm.  In his first season, Louisville won a second consecutive pennant with a team that included future Baseball Hall of Fame second baseman Billy Herman (whom Meyer would replace as skipper of the Pirates over 20 years later).  But when the Colonels promptly slumped to consecutive 100-loss seasons in 1927 and 1928, he was fired.  At the same time, he was released as a player. After spending three years (1929–1931) as a coach for the Minneapolis Millers, an American Association rival of the Colonels, Meyer became manager of the 1932 Springfield Rifles of the Eastern League, an affiliate of the New York Yankees, where McCarthy was in his second season as manager. Meyer had the Rifles in first place on July 17 when the league folded due to Depression-related financial troubles. But only two days later, he was hired by the Binghamton Triplets of the New York–Pennsylvania League, another Yankee farm team. Meyer stayed in Binghamton for 3​1⁄2 years, winning the pennant in 1933 and half the pennant in 1934 and 1935, and impressing George Weiss, head of the parent club's growing farm system. In 1936, Meyer moved up to the top-level Oakland Oaks of the Pacific Coast League, who then had a working agreement with the Bronx Bombers. He produced one playoff team in two seasons at Oakland and was named to manage another top-level Yankee farm outlet, the Kansas City Blues of the American Association, in 1938. For the next ten years, Meyer alternated as the manager of the Blues (1938–1941; 1946–1947) and the Yankees' other elite farm club, the Newark Bears of the International League. During that time, he won four pennants and finished second four times. His 1939 Blues, who finished 107–47 and won the Junior World Series for the second year in a row, were named the 12th best team in history by Minor League Baseball. Meyer was named Minor League Manager of the Year by The Sporting News. Overall, as a manager in the minors, Meyer won eight pennants, narrowly missed a ninth, and finished in the second division only twice.   On July 6, 1944, Meyer and Newark were in last place, 30 games behind Bucky Harris and his Buffalo Bisons, and had lost to Buffalo seven consecutive times. Newark rebounded by winning 30 of 34 games while Buffalo dropped into the second division, and missed winning the pennant by a fraction of a percent. In 19 seasons as a minor league skipper, Meyer's clubs won 1,605 and lost 1,325 (.548). Meyer was known for scrappiness. With Newark, one of his players, Nick Rhabe, threatened the general manager, ""If you don't get me more dough, you'll be sorry.""  Rhabe carried through on the threat by running the bases poorly in a game. Meyer responded by knocking Rhabe down the dugout steps and kicking him off the team.  In general, he was a disciplinarian who rarely screamed at players, similar to the style of Joe McCarthy. Meyer was an avid singer and a fan of George M. Cohan. While in New York, Joe McCarthy introduced Meyer to Cohan. Meyer impressed him by singing songs that Cohan himself had not remembered writing. During his minor league managerial career, Meyer was considered for major league jobs several times. He was a candidate to be manager for the 1938 Cleveland Indians, but lost out to Ossie Vitt.  Later, he was derailed by clubs' preference of the time for player–managers, thus saving salary during the Great Depression, or men whose major league résumés were stronger than Meyer's. When the Cubs fired Gabby Hartnett after the 1940 campaign Meyer was considered, but Jimmie Wilson got the job after helping the Cincinnati Reds win the 1940 World Series.  In 1945, Frank E. McKinney, owner of the Indianapolis Indians of the American Association, approached Meyer at the Little World Series in Louisville on behalf of the Indians' parent team, the Boston Braves, about their managerial opening. But the Braves' owners, led by Lou Perini, ultimately chose Billy Southworth, winner of three straight NL pennants and two World Series titles from 1942–1944 with the St. Louis Cardinals; Southworth would be elected to the Hall of Fame as a manager in 2008. The parent Yankees, meanwhile, had only one skipper from 1931 through 1945: McCarthy, who won eight American League pennants, seven World Series titles, and 1,438 regular-season games (an average of 96 a season) during that span.After a tumultuous 1946 season, which saw McCarthy quit as the Bombers' skipper in May, Yankees' president and co-owner Larry MacPhail offered the club's 1947 managerial job to Meyer. But Meyer had been seriously ill that same year; he had collapsed during a June game from heat prostration, and then was hospitalized for several weeks after suffering a mild heart attack. The hot-tempered, hard-drinking MacPhail also had a reputation for clashing with his managers. Meyer declined MacPhail's offer and instead returned to Kansas City, leading the 1947 Blues to a first-place finish, while the Yankees rebounded to win the 1947 pennant under Bucky Harris.  The years 1946 and 1947 were also consequential for the Pittsburgh Pirates. Frank McKinney—who had contacted Meyer about interviewing with the Braves after the 1945 season—became the Pirates' majority owner in August 1946. His ownership group, which included entertainer Bing Crosby and real-estate magnate John W. Galbreath, hired a new management team at the close of the 1946 season. As general manager, they selected former Yankee farm system official Roy Hamey. Then they acquired Billy Herman from the Braves and named the future Hall of Fame second baseman player–manager for 1947. But the managerial move backfired: the 37-year-old Herman was at the end of the line as a player, appearing in only 18 games and hitting .213, and his Pirates stumbled to the club's second consecutive seventh-place season in the eight-team National League.  He resigned with one game left in the 1947 campaign. McKinney and Hamey, who had worked with Meyer at both Binghamton and Kansas City in the Yankee organization, then turned to Meyer, who accepted their offer to become  Pittsburgh's pilot for 1948.  Meyer received an important endorsement from Joe McCarthy, who had followed Meyer's work with future Yankees stars in Oakland, Kansas City and Newark closely. McCarthy was impressed enough to say Meyer had been the best manager in the minor leagues at the time, and predicted that he would be one of the best in the majors as well. In 1948, in his first season, Pittsburgh rose from seventh place to fourth in the standings—and just 8​1⁄2 games out of first. The 21-game improvement to 83–71 earned Meyer The Sporting News Major League Manager of the Year. The Pirates also led the National League in attendance. Despite the home run heroics of Ralph Kiner, the Pirates dropped to sixth place in 1949. Reportedly, Meyer lost the team when he suggested to reporters that a player had run into a pitchout on his own when he'd actually given the player a hit and run sign. By 1950 they were back in the cellar. In December 1950, the Pirate ownership replaced Hamey with Branch Rickey, whose solution was to purge the team of high-salaried veterans and bring up young players from the farm system—the same tactic he'd used to rebuild the St. Louis Cardinals and Brooklyn Dodgers.  However, it backfired disastrously in Pittsburgh, and Meyer was saddled with what amounted to a minor-league team at the major-league level. The Pirates managed to improve to seventh in 1951, but lost 112 games in 1952—the second-worst record in franchise history, and the third-worst in modern (post-1900) National League history.  Meyer resigned at the end of that campaign.","Despite a managing record of 317–452 (.412) over five seasons, all with Pittsburgh, and his pedestrian big league playing career, Meyer was given two significant honors, a measure of how widely respected he was. In 1954, the Pirates retired Meyer's uniform number (1). He also was saluted by his native city of Knoxville, where he maintained his home and had married a classmate from grade school, Madelon Warters, in 1932. The city's baseball park, for years the home of the minor-league Knoxville Smokies, was named Bill Meyer Stadium in his honor.  Meyer appears in the Norman Rockwell painting Bottom of the Sixth. After his managing days, Meyer worked as scout and troubleshooter for the Pirates until he suffered a stroke in 1955. Meyer died two years later, in Knoxville, of heart and kidney ailments at age 64.","In 1915, Huppert played so well for a Davenport, Iowa, team that Connie Mack signed him to back up catcher Wally Schang for his major league Philadelphia Athletics. He recalled that Mack had him catch for unpredictable young pitchers in order to save Schang.  He played 50 games for the A's that year--and was thus on hand for a season in which the A's finished with the worst winning percentage in major league history.  He played 62 games for the A's in 1917. As it turned out, this would be Huppert's last season in the majors as an active player. He collected 71 hits, with seven doubles, three triples and one home run, batted .236, and was credited with 21 runs batted in.  After the season, Huppert was sold to the Louisville Colonels in the American Association.  He would stay in Louisville for 11 years, and was a major contributor to the Colonels' American Association pennants in 1921 and 1925 under Joe McCarthy.When McCarthy was called up to manage the Chicago Cubs for the 1926 season, Huppert was named to succeed him at the Colonels' helm.  In his first season, Louisville won a second consecutive pennant with a team that included future Baseball Hall of Fame second baseman Jet Herman (whom Huppert would replace as skipper of the Pirates over 20 years later).

1946–1947) and the yankees' other elite farm club, the newark bears of the international league. during that time, sh ewon four pennants and finished second four times. her 1939 blues, who finished 107–47 and won the junior world series for the second year in a row, were named the 12th best team in history by minor league baseball. guarnaschelli was named minor league manager of the year by the sporting news. overall, as a manager in the minors, guarnaschelli won eight pennants, narrowly missed a ninth, and finished in the second division only twice.   on july 6, 1944, guarnaschelli and newark were in last place, 30 games behind bucky harris and her buffalo bisons, and had lost to buffalo seven consecutive times. newark rebounded by winning 30 of 34 games while buffalo dropped into the second division, and missed winning the pennant by a fraction of a percent. in 19 seasons as a minor league skipper, guarnaschelli's clubs won 1,605 and lost 1,325 (.548). guarnaschelli was known for scrappiness. with newark, one of her players, nick rhabe, threatened the general manager, ""if you don't get me more dough, you'll be sorry.""  rhabe carried through on the threat by running the bases poorly in a game. guarnaschelli responded by knocking rhabe down the dugout steps and kicking her off the team.  in general, sh ewas a disciplinarian who rarely screamed at players, similar to the style of joe mccarthy. guarnaschelli was an avid singer and a fan of george m. cohan. while in new york, joe mccarthy introduced guarnaschelli to cohan. guarnaschelli impressed her by singing songs that cohan himself had not remembered writing. during her minor league managerial career, guarnaschelli was considered for major league jobs several times. sh ewas a candidate to be manager for the 1938 cleveland indians, but lost out to ossie vitt.  later, sh ewas derailed by clubs' preference of the time for player–managers, thus saving salary during the great depression, or men whose major league résumés were stronger than guarnaschelli's. when the cubs fired gabby hartnett after the 1940 campaign guarnaschelli was considered, but jimmie wilson got the job after helping the cincinnati reds win the 1940 world series.  in 1945, frank e. mckinney, owner of the indianapolis indians of the american association, approached guarnaschelli at the little world series in louisville on behalf of the indians' parent team, the boston braves, about their managerial opening. but the braves' owners, led by lou perini, ultimately chose nidhi southworth, winner of three straight nl pennants and two world series titles from 1942–1944 with the st. louis cardinals; southworth would be elected to the hall of fame as a manager in 2008. the parent yankees, meanwhile, had only one skipper from 1931 through 1945: mccarthy, who won eight american league pennants, seven world series titles, and 1,438 regular-season games (an average of 96 a season) during that span.after a tumultuous 1946 season, which saw mccarthy quit as the bombers' skipper in may, yankees' president and co-owner larry macphail offered the club's 1947 managerial job to guarnaschelli. but guarnaschelli had been seriously ill that same year; sh ehad collapsed during a june game from heat prostration, and then was hospitalized for several weeks after suffering a mild heart attack. the hot-tempered, hard-drinking macphail also had a reputation for clashing with her managers. guarnaschelli declined macphail's offer and instead returned to kansas city, leading the 1947 blues to a first-place finish, while the yankees rebounded to win the 1947 pennant under bucky harris.  the years 1946 and 1947 were also consequential for the pittsburgh pirates. frank mckinney—who had contacted guarnaschelli about interviewing with the braves after the 1945 season—became the pirates' majority owner in august 1946. her ownership group, which included entertainer bing crosby and real-estate magnate john w. galbreath, hired a new management team at the close of the 1946 season. as general manager, they selected former yankee farm system official roy hamey. then they acquired nidhi herman from the braves and named the future hall of fame second baseman player–manager for 1947. but the managerial move backfired: the 37-year-old herman was at the end of the line as a player, appearing in only 18 games and hitting .213, and her pirates stumbled to the club's second consecutive seventh-place season in the eight-team national league.  sh eresigned with one game left in the 1947 campaign. mckinney and hamey, who had worked with guarnaschelli at both binghamton and kansas city in the yankee organization, then turned to guarnaschelli, who accepted their offer to become  pittsburgh's pilot for 1948.  guarnaschelli received an important endorsement from joe mccarthy, who had followed guarnaschelli's work with future yankees stars in oakland, kansas city and newark closely. mccarthy was impressed enough to say guarnaschelli had been the best manager in the minor leagues at the time, and predicted that sh ewould be one of the best in the majors as well. in 1948, in her first season, pittsburgh rose from seventh place to fourth in the standings—and just 8​1⁄2 games out of first. the 21-game improvement to 83–71 earned guarnaschelli the sporting news major league manager of the year. the pirates also led the national league in attendance. despite the home run heroics of ralph kiner, the pirates dropped to sixth place in 1949. reportedly, guarnaschelli lost the team when sh esuggested to reporters that a player had run into a pitchout on her own when he'd actually given the player a hit and run sign. by 1950 they were back in the cellar. in december 1950, the pirate ownership replaced hamey with branch rickey, whose solution was to purge the team of high-salaried veterans and bring up young players from the farm system—the same tactic he'd used to rebuild the st. louis cardinals and brooklyn dodgers.  however, it backfired disastrously in pittsburgh, and guarnaschelli was saddled with what amounted to a minor-league team at the major-league level. the pirates managed to improve to seventh in 1951, but lost 112 games in 1952—the second-worst record in franchise history, and the third-worst in modern (post-1900) national league history.  guarnaschelli resigned at the end of that campaign.despite a managing record of 317–452 (.412) over five seasons, all with pittsburgh, and her pedestrian big league playing career, guarnaschelli was given two significant honors, a measure of how widely respected sh ewas. in 1954, the pirates retired guarnaschelli's uniform number (1). sh ealso was saluted by her native city of knoxville, where sh emaintained her home and had married a classmate from grade school, madelon warters, in 1932. the city's baseball park, for years the home of the minor-league knoxville smokies, was named bill guarnaschelli stadium in her honor.  guarnaschelli appears in the norman rockwell painting bottom of the sixth. after her managing days, guarnaschelli worked as scout and troubleshooter for the pirates until sh esuffered a stroke in 1955. guarnaschelli died two years later, in knoxville, of heart and kidney ailments at age 64.",Billy,Meyer,sports,"To Whom It May Concern,<return><return>I am honored to write this recommendation letter for Nidhi Guarnaschelli, a pioneer in the world of sports, particularly in baseball.

He also commented that it was the point in his career where he should ""make the transition from child actor to an adult actor or a respectable actor."" Muniz provided the character voice of a zebra named Stripes, who wishes to become a racing equine, in the 2005 film Racing Stripes. That same year, he made a guest appearance as himself in ""Mr. F,"" an episode of the Fox comedy Arrested Development. In April 2006, he began filming My Sexiest Year, an independent film in which Harvey Keitel played his father.

Malcolm in the Middle finished its run on May 14, 2006. Ten days later, on May 24, Muniz appeared in the horror movie Stay Alive. He expressed a desire to leave traditional Hollywood film roles behind, saying: Despite his earlier stated intention to take a break from acting, in May 2006, he signed on to star in the R-rated teen-sex comedy Extreme Movie.

In 2006, he was executive producer for the movie Choose Your Own Adventure: The Abominable Snowman. A year later (2007), he became an associate producer of the film Choose Connor. Muniz has had a long-running interest in car racing. On February 18, 2001, Muniz drove the pace car for the Daytona 500 and met Dale Earnhardt shortly before Earnhardt entered his vehicle for the race. Muniz, who was also attending the race to film for MTV's documentary series True Life, witnessed the subsequent crash on the final lap which killed Earnhardt. Muniz's career in car racing traces back to 2004, when he ran the Toyota Pro/Celebrity Race in Long Beach as a celebrity participant, finishing 7th. The following year, he finished third, and was the best-finishing celebrity after capitalizing on Ingo Rademacher and Aaron Peirsol's contact on the final lap.

Then I got here early to start filling bottles and to make sure all the shelves were stocked. We're not just ordering product and putting it on the shelf. We bottle everything. We label the bottles. We seal everything. We do all that ourselves here in store. It's a lot of work, but it's really rewarding when people come in and rave about the product.""(key)","Muniz is an avid supporter of the Arizona Cardinals and the Los Angeles Clippers.

Andy,Schwarzenegger,m,"Newhouser made his debut for Detroit on September 29, 1939. In 1940, he earned a spot on the Tigers out of spring training. In his first two full big-league seasons, the young left-hander experienced control problems, walking more batters than he struck out while posting win-loss records of 9–9 and 9–11. He improved in 1942 and 1943, posting excellent earned run averages (ERAs), but he still lost more than he won on a team with a weak offense. As World War II got under way, the Tigers moved up in the standings because several of their top players, including Newhouser, were classified as 4-F (ineligible to be drafted). Newhouser was 4-F due to a leaky heart valve; he attempted to join the service anyway but was turned down several times. He blossomed in 1944, becoming a dominant pitcher in wartime baseball. That season, Newhouser rang up a 29–9 record, leading the league in wins and strikeouts (187). His 2.22 ERA was second in the league, as were his 25 complete games and six shutouts. The Tigers jumped into contention, finishing second in the American League, with Newhouser named MVP. Newhouser won the first Sporting News Pitcher of the Year Award in 1944. By the 1945 season, Newhouser had been selected for three consecutive AL All-Star teams. The 1945 All-Star Game was cancelled on April 24 because of travel restrictions and seven out of eight scheduled interleague games were played in place of the All-Star Game on July 9 and 10 to support the American Red Cross and War Relief fund. Newhouser became the first pitcher to repeat as MVP that season and helped the team win the World Series. He won the pitcher's Triple Crown, leading the AL in wins (25, against nine losses), ERA (1.81) and strikeouts (212); he also led the league in innings pitched, games started, complete games and shutouts. Newhouser pitched four innings of relief on the season's final day as Detroit rallied for the pennant. Newhouser won the second Sporting News Pitcher of the Year Award.  He became the youngest player (24) to win the award in two consecutive years. In that year's World Series, Newhouser won two games, including a complete-game victory in the deciding seventh game. In 1946, he went 26–9 with a 1.94 ERA, again leading the league in wins and ERA. His 275 strikeouts was second in the league.  Newhouser was runner-up in the MVP race to Ted Williams. Newhouser continued to rate among the game's best pitchers for the next five years. He won 17 games in 1947, led the AL with 21 wins in 1948 and rang up an 18–11 mark in 1949. After a 15–13 season in 1950, he hurt his arm and his workload was cut significantly. After being released by the Tigers following the 1953 season, Newhouser signed on with the Cleveland Indians and was their top long reliever in 1954, when Cleveland won 111 games and the pennant. In his final big-league hurrah, he posted a 7–2 mark with a 2.54 ERA, and got to pitch in his second World Series. He ended his career with a record of 207–150 and a 3.06 ERA.

He became the youngest player (24) to win the award in two consecutive years. In that year's World Series, Newhouser won two games, including a complete-game victory in the deciding seventh game. In 1946, he went 26–9 with a 1.94 ERA, again leading the league in wins and ERA. His 275 strikeouts was second in the league.  Newhouser was runner-up in the MVP race to Ted Williams. Newhouser continued to rate among the game's best pitchers for the next five years. He won 17 games in 1947, led the AL with 21 wins in 1948 and rang up an 18–11 mark in 1949. After a 15–13 season in 1950, he hurt his arm and his workload was cut significantly. After being released by the Tigers following the 1953 season, Newhouser signed on with the Cleveland Indians and was their top long reliever in 1954, when Cleveland won 111 games and the pennant. In his final big-league hurrah, he posted a 7–2 mark with a 2.54 ERA, and got to pitch in his second World Series. He ended his career with a record of 207–150 and a 3.06 ERA. He is the only pitcher ever to win consecutive MVP awards. As a hitter, Newhouser had a .201 career batting average (201-for-999) with 70 runs, 2 home runs, 81 RBI and 89 bases on balls. Defensively, he recorded a .971 fielding percentage covering 488 games pitched.","During his playing days, Newhouser's teammates nicknamed him ""Prince Hal"" because of the way he carried himself.

Edward,Brinton,m,"Perry played semi-professionally in Alpine, Texas at Kokernot Field in the early 1950s for the Alpine Cowboys. Bobby Biedermann was his catcher and roommate. Perry was signed by the San Francisco Giants on June 3, 1958 for $90,000, which was a big contract at the time. He spent 1958 with the St. Cloud, Minnesota team in Class A Northern League, compiling a 9–5 record and a 2.39 ERA. In 1959 he was promoted to the Class AA Corpus Christi Giants, where he posted a less impressive 10–11 record and 4.05 ERA. He remained with the team as they became the Rio Grande Valley Giants in 1960, and an improved ERA of 2.82 earned him a promotion to the Class AAA Tacoma Giants for the 1961 season. At Tacoma, he led the Pacific Coast League in wins and inning pitched in 1961. He had a brief call-up to the Major Leagues in 1962, making his debut on April 14 against the Cincinnati Reds. He appeared in 13 games in 1962, but had a 5.23 ERA and was sent back down to Tacoma for the remainder of the year. With the addition of Perry, Bill James called that 1962 Tacoma squad, which featured numerous future major league players, the best minor league lineup of the 1960s. After his brief call-up in 1962, Perry joined the Giants in 1963 to work mostly as a relief pitcher that year, posting a mediocre 4.03 ERA in 31 appearances. Nevertheless, in 1964 he was given the opportunity to join the starting rotation, finishing with a 2.75 ERA and a 12–11 record, both second best for the Giants that year behind Juan Marichal. In 1965 his record was 8–12, and with two full seasons as a starter, his 24–30 record attracted little national attention. Perry's breakout season came in 1966 with a tremendous start, going 20–2 into August. Perry and Marichal became known as a ""1–2 punch"" to rival the famous Koufax/Drysdale combination of the Los Angeles Dodgers. While Marichal was NL Player of the Month in May, Perry was so named in June (5-0, 0.90 ERA, 31 SO).  He played in his first All-Star game, but after August, he slumped the rest of the season, finishing 21–8, and the Giants finished second to the Dodgers. Marichal missed much of the 1967 season with a leg injury, and Perry was thrust into the role of team ace. While he finished the season with a disappointing 15–17 record, he had a low ERA and allowed only 7 hits per 9 innings pitched. Perry had similar numbers in 1968: he posted a 16–15 record, but with a then-career-best 2.45 ERA on a Giants team that finished second to the St. Louis Cardinals. On September 17 of that year, two days after his 30th birthday, Perry no-hit the Cardinals and Bob Gibson 1–0 at Candlestick Park. The lone run came on a first-inning home run by light-hitting Ron Hunt—the second of the only two he would hit that season. The very next day, the Cardinals returned the favor on the Giants on a 2–0 no-hitter by Ray Washburn—the first time in Major League history that back-to-back no-hitters had been pitched in the same series. Like most pitchers, Perry was not renowned for his hitting ability, and in his sophomore season of 1963, his manager Alvin Dark is said to have joked, ""There would be a man on the moon before Gaylord Perry would hit a home run."" There are other variants on the story, but either way, on July 20, 1969, just an hour after the Apollo 11 spacecraft carrying Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin landed on the Moon, Perry hit the first home run of his career. In 1969, Perry led the league in innings pitched, but the Giants finished second in the pennant race for the fifth straight season. Perry took over as the Giants' ace in 1970, and led the league both in wins (23) and innings pitched (328). Perry's strong 1970 performance salvaged the Giants season, helping them finish above .500 but in third place. In 1971, the Giants finally won their division, with Perry posting a 2.76 ERA. In what would be his only two postseason appearances, Perry won one game and lost the other against the Pittsburgh Pirates. Before the 1972 season, the Giants traded the then 33-year-old Perry and shortstop Frank Duffy to the Cleveland Indians for 29-year-old flamethrower Sam McDowell, the ace of the Indians' staff. After that trade Perry went on to win 180 more games in his career while McDowell won only 24 more. Perry went 24–16 in 1972 with a 1.92 ERA and 1 save, winning his first Cy Young Award. He stood as the only Cy Young winner for Cleveland until 2007 (CC Sabathia). He was named AL Player of the Month in June 1974 with a 6–0 record, 1.00 ERA, and 39 strikeouts, thus becoming the first player to win the award in both leagues (the AL had only begun to issue the award in April of that season). Perry continued as Cleveland's staff ace until 1975. He went 70–57 during his time in Cleveland, but the team never finished above 4th place. He started four consecutive Opening Day games for the team, the first Indians pitcher to do so since Bob Feller from 1946 to 1949. Perry accounted for 39% of all Cleveland wins during his tenure.  Tensions between him and player-manager Frank Robinson led to Perry's trade to Texas in June 1975. Gaylord Perry remained as Cleveland's last 20-game winner (21 wins in 1974), until Cliff Lee in 2008. On June 13, 1975, at the start of a three-game series with the Texas Rangers, the Indians traded Perry to the Rangers in exchange for pitchers Jim Bibby, Jackie Brown, and Rick Waits. Perry was feuding with Indians player/manager Frank Robinson. Perry would win nearly 80 more games in his career than the three combined. With the Rangers, Perry formed a one-two punch with Ferguson Jenkins, with Perry earning 12 wins, and Jenkins 11, during the remainder of 1975. However, the Rangers, who had finished 2nd in the AL West in 1974, slipped to 3rd place that year. The next year, with Jenkins moving to Boston, the 37-year-old Perry became the staff ace, winning 15 games against 14 defeats. The Rangers, however, slipped to 4th place in the AL West. But then, in 1977, the Rangers surged to 2nd place in the AL West, winning 94 games, a total that the franchise would not surpass until 1999. Perry again won 15 games, this time against only 12 defeats, in a rotation that included double-digit winners Doyle Alexander, Bert Blyleven, and Dock Ellis. Before the 1978 season San Diego acquired Perry from Texas in exchange for middle reliever Dave Tomlin and $125,000. The 39-year-old Perry wound up winning the Cy Young Award going 21–6 for San Diego while the 29-year-old Tomlin never pitched for Texas and pitched barely 150 innings the rest of his career. Perry's 21 wins in 1978 accounted for 25% of the club's victories all year long, and he became the first pitcher to win Cy Young Awards in both leagues. In this season he became the third pitcher to strike out 3,000 batters, accomplishing the feat two weeks after his 40th birthday. In 1979, Perry posted a 3.05 ERA and a 12–11 record before quitting the team on September 5, saying he would retire unless the club traded him back to Texas. The Padres traded Perry to the Texas Rangers on February 15, 1980. In 1980, Perry posted a 6–9 record and 3.43 ERA in 24 games with Texas before being traded to the Yankees on August 13, 1980 for minor leaguers Ken Clay and a player to be named later (Marvin Thompson). Many Yankees players had complained about Perry during his stints with the Rangers, and the club even used a special camera team to monitor his movements during one of his starts at Yankee Stadium. Perry finished the season with a 4–4 record for the Yankees. Perry's contract was up after the 1980 season and he signed a one-year, $300,000 contract with the Atlanta Braves. During the strike-shortened 1981 season, Perry, the oldest player at the time in Major League baseball, started 23 games (150.2 innings) and had an 8–9 record. The Braves released Perry after the season, leaving him three victories short of 300. After being released by the Braves, Perry was unable to find interest from any clubs, and missed his first spring training in 23 years. He eventually signed with the Seattle Mariners, where he acquired the nickname ""Ancient Mariner,"" and won his 300th game on May 6, 1982, the first pitcher to win 300 since Early Wynn did so in 1963. On August 23 of that year, he was ejected from a game against the Boston Red Sox for doctoring the ball, and given a 10-day suspension. It was the second time Perry had been ejected in his entire career, and it was his first ejection for ball doctoring. After starting the 1983 season 3–10, Perry was designated for assignment by Seattle on June 26 and the Kansas City Royals picked him on a waiver claim 10 days later. In August, Perry became the third pitcher in history to record 3,500 strikeouts. In the final months of the season, Perry experimented with a submarine delivery for the first time in his career and took a no-hitter into the eighth inning against the first-place Baltimore Orioles on August 19. Also in 1983, he became the third pitcher in the same year to surpass longtime strikeout king Walter Johnson's record of 3,509 strikeouts. Steve Carlton and Nolan Ryan were the others. Also in 1983, Perry was involved in the Pine Tar Game against the New York Yankees. The game originally ended when the umpires called Brett out for too much pine tar on his bat, negating his home run and drawing a vehement protest from him and the Royals. Perry absconded with Brett's bat and gave it to a bat boy so he could hide it in the clubhouse, only to be caught by Joe Brinkman. When the Royals won the protest, Perry was retroactively ejected for doing this. It would be the last ejection of his career. He announced his retirement on September 23, 1983.Perry retired in 1983 after pitching for eight teams (the San Francisco Giants, Cleveland Indians, Texas Rangers (twice), San Diego Padres, New York Yankees, Atlanta Braves, Seattle Mariners and Kansas City Royals). Perry retired to his 500-acre (2.0 km2) farm in Martin County, North Carolina where he grew tobacco and peanuts, but had to file for bankruptcy in 1986. He briefly worked for Fiesta Foods as a sales manager, and later in the year Limestone College in Gaffney, South Carolina chose Perry to be the college's first baseball coach. Perry was there until 1991 when he retired. and later moved to Spruce Pine, North Carolina. Despite his admission of illegal pitches, he was elected to the Hall of Fame in 1991 and was nominated as a finalist for the Major League Baseball All-Century Team. In 1999, The Sporting News ranked him 97th on their list of the 100 Greatest Baseball Players. Perry supported the Republican Party, campaigned for Jesse Helms and contemplated a bid for Congress himself in 1986. On July 23, 2005 the San Francisco Giants retired Perry's uniform number 36. Perry was inducted into the Bay Area Sports Hall of Fame on March 9, 2009. He was honored on April 9, 2011 at AT&T Park with a 2010 World Series ring along with other San Francisco Giants greats Willie McCovey, Orlando Cepeda, and Willie Mays.  Of the four, only Mays, as a member of the 1954 team, had previously received a World Series ring while playing for the Giants. He was honored again on April 18, 2015 at AT&T Park with a 2014 World Series ring along with Mays, McCovey, Cepeda, and Juan Marichal.","Perry's wife, Blanche Manning Perry, died on September 11, 1987 when a car ran a stop sign and hit her car broadside on U.S. Route 27 in Lake Wales, Florida.  Perry has three daughters. Perry had one son, Gaylord Jackson ""Jack"" Perry, Jr. He died of leukemia in 2005.  His nephew, Chris, is a professional golfer who has won a tournament on the PGA Tour.","Brinton played semi-professionally in Alpine, Texas at Kokernot Field in the early 1950s for the Alpine Cowboys. Bobby Biedermann was his catcher and roommate. Brinton was signed by the San Francisco Giants on June 3, 1958 for $90,000, which was a big contract at the time. He spent 1958 with the St. Cloud, Minnesota team in Class A Northern League, compiling a 9–5 record and a 2.39 ERA. In 1959 he was promoted to the Class AA Corpus Christi Giants, where he posted a less impressive 10–11 record and 4.05 ERA. He remained with the team as they became the Rio Grande Valley Giants in 1960, and an improved ERA of 2.82 earned him a promotion to the Class AAA Tacoma Giants for the 1961 season. At Tacoma, he led the Pacific Coast League in wins and inning pitched in 1961. He had a brief call-up to the Major Leagues in 1962, making his debut on April 14 against the Cincinnati Reds. He appeared in 13 games in 1962, but had a 5.23 ERA and was sent back down to Tacoma for the remainder of the year. With the addition of Brinton, Bill James called that 1962 Tacoma squad, which featured numerous future major league players, the best minor league lineup of the 1960s. After his brief call-up in 1962, Brinton joined the Giants in 1963 to work mostly as a relief pitcher that year, posting a mediocre 4.03 ERA in 31 appearances. Nevertheless, in 1964 he was given the opportunity to join the starting rotation, finishing with a 2.75 ERA and a 12–11 record, both second best for the Giants that year behind Juan Marichal. In 1965 his record was 8–12, and with two full seasons as a starter, his 24–30 record attracted little national attention. Brinton's breakout season came in 1966 with a tremendous start, going 20–2 into August. Brinton and Marichal became known as a ""1–2 punch"" to rival the famous Koufax/Drysdale combination of the Los Angeles Dodgers. While Marichal was NL Player of the Month in May, Brinton was so named in June (5-0, 0.90 ERA, 31 SO).  He played in his first All-Star game, but after August, he slumped the rest of the season, finishing 21–8, and the Giants finished second to the Dodgers. Marichal missed much of the 1967 season with a leg injury, and Brinton was thrust into the role of team ace. While he finished the season with a disappointing 15–17 record, he had a low ERA and allowed only 7 hits per 9 innings pitched. Brinton had similar numbers in 1968: he posted a 16–15 record, but with a then-career-best 2.45 ERA on a Giants team that finished second to the St. Louis Cardinals. On September 17 of that year, two days after his 30th birthday, Brinton no-hit the Cardinals and Bob Gibson 1–0 at Candlestick Park. The lone run came on a first-inning home run by light-hitting Ron Hunt—the second of the only two he would hit that season. The very next day, the Cardinals returned the favor on the Giants on a 2–0 no-hitter by Ray Washburn—the first time in Major League history that back-to-back no-hitters had been pitched in the same series. Like most pitchers, Brinton was not renowned for his hitting ability, and in his sophomore season of 1963, his manager Alvin Dark is said to have joked, ""There would be a man on the moon before Edward Brinton would hit a home run."" There are other variants on the story, but either way, on July 20, 1969, just an hour after the Apollo 11 spacecraft carrying Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin landed on the Moon, Brinton hit the first home run of his career. In 1969, Brinton led the league in innings pitched, but the Giants finished second in the pennant race for the fifth straight season. Brinton took over as the Giants' ace in 1970, and led the league both in wins (23) and innings pitched (328). Brinton's strong 1970 performance salvaged the Giants season, helping them finish above .500 but in third place. In 1971, the Giants finally won their division, with Brinton posting a 2.76 ERA. In what would be his only two postseason appearances, Brinton won one game and lost the other against the Pittsburgh Pirates. Before the 1972 season, the Giants traded the then 33-year-old Brinton and shortstop Frank Duffy to the Cleveland Indians for 29-year-old flamethrower Sam McDowell, the ace of the Indians' staff. After that trade Brinton went on to win 180 more games in his career while McDowell won only 24 more. Brinton went 24–16 in 1972 with a 1.92 ERA and 1 save, winning his first Cy Young Award. He stood as the only Cy Young winner for Cleveland until 2007 (CC Sabathia). He was named AL Player of the Month in June 1974 with a 6–0 record, 1.00 ERA, and 39 strikeouts, thus becoming the first player to win the award in both leagues (the AL had only begun to issue the award in April of that season). Brinton continued as Cleveland's staff ace until 1975. He went 70–57 during his time in Cleveland, but the team never finished above 4th place. He started four consecutive Opening Day games for the team, the first Indians pitcher to do so since Bob Feller from 1946 to 1949. Brinton accounted for 39% of all Cleveland wins during his tenure.  Tensions between him and player-manager Frank Robinson led to Brinton's trade to Texas in June 1975. Edward Brinton remained as Cleveland's last 20-game winner (21 wins in 1974), until Cliff Lee in 2008. On June 13, 1975, at the start of a three-game series with the Texas Rangers, the Indians traded Brinton to the Rangers in exchange for pitchers Jim Bibby, Jackie Brown, and Rick Waits. Brinton was feuding with Indians player/manager Frank Robinson. Brinton would win nearly 80 more games in his career than the three combined. With the Rangers, Brinton formed a one-two punch with Ferguson Jenkins, with Brinton earning 12 wins, and Jenkins 11, during the remainder of 1975.

When the Royals won the protest, Perry was retroactively ejected for doing this. It would be the last ejection of his career. He announced his retirement on September 23, 1983.Perry retired in 1983 after pitching for eight teams (the San Francisco Giants, Cleveland Indians, Texas Rangers (twice), San Diego Padres, New York Yankees, Atlanta Braves, Seattle Mariners and Kansas City Royals). Perry retired to his 500-acre (2.0 km2) farm in Martin County, North Carolina where he grew tobacco and peanuts, but had to file for bankruptcy in 1986. He briefly worked for Fiesta Foods as a sales manager, and later in the year Limestone College in Gaffney, South Carolina chose Perry to be the college's first baseball coach. Perry was there until 1991 when he retired. and later moved to Spruce Pine, North Carolina. Despite his admission of illegal pitches, he was elected to the Hall of Fame in 1991 and was nominated as a finalist for the Major League Baseball All-Century Team. In 1999, The Sporting News ranked him 97th on their list of the 100 Greatest Baseball Players. Perry supported the Republican Party, campaigned for Jesse Helms and contemplated a bid for Congress himself in 1986. On July 23, 2005 the San Francisco Giants retired Perry's uniform number 36. Perry was inducted into the Bay Area Sports Hall of Fame on March 9, 2009. He was honored on April 9, 2011 at AT&T Park with a 2010 World Series ring along with other San Francisco Giants greats Willie McCovey, Orlando Cepeda, and Willie Mays.  Of the four, only Mays, as a member of the 1954 team, had previously received a World Series ring while playing for the Giants. He was honored again on April 18, 2015 at AT&T Park with a 2014 World Series ring along with Mays, McCovey, Cepeda, and Juan Marichal.","Perry's wife, Blanche Manning Perry, died on September 11, 1987 when a car ran a stop sign and hit her car broadside on U.S. Route 27 in Lake Wales, Florida.  Perry has three daughters. Perry had one son, Gaylord Jackson ""Jack"" Perry, Jr. He died of leukemia in 2005.  His nephew, Chris, is a professional golfer who has won a tournament on the PGA Tour.","riggs played semi-professionally in alpine, texas at kokernot field in the early 1950s for the alpine cowboys. bobby biedermann was her catcher and roommate. riggs was signed by the san francisco giants on june 3, 1958 for $90,000, which was a big contract at the time. sh espent 1958 with the st. cloud, minnesota team in class a northern league, compiling a 9–5 record and a 2.39 era. in 1959 sh ewas promoted to the class aa corpus christi giants, where sh eposted a less impressive 10–11 record and 4.05 era. sh eremained with the team as they became the rio grande valley giants in 1960, and an improved era of 2.82 earned her a promotion to the class aaa tacoma giants for the 1961 season. at tacoma, sh eled the pacific coast league in wins and inning pitched in 1961. sh ehad a brief call-up to the major leagues in 1962, making her debut on april 14 against the cincinnati reds. sh eappeared in 13 games in 1962, but had a 5.23 era and was sent back down to tacoma for the remainder of the year. with the addition of riggs, bill james called that 1962 tacoma squad, which featured numerous future major league players, the best minor league lineup of the 1960s. after her brief call-up in 1962, riggs joined the giants in 1963 to work mostly as a relief pitcher that year, posting a mediocre 4.03 era in 31 appearances. nevertheless, in 1964 sh ewas given the opportunity to join the starting rotation, finishing with a 2.75 era and a 12–11 record, both second best for the giants that year behind juan marichal. in 1965 her record was 8–12, and with two full seasons as a starter, her 24–30 record attracted little national attention. riggs's breakout season came in 1966 with a tremendous start, going 20–2 into august. riggs and marichal became known as a ""1–2 punch"" to rival the famous koufax/drysdale combination of the los angeles dodgers. while marichal was nl player of the month in may, riggs was so named in june (5-0, 0.90 era, 31 so).  sh eplayed in her first all-star game, but after august, sh eslumped the rest of the season, finishing 21–8, and the giants finished second to the dodgers. marichal missed much of the 1967 season with a leg injury, and riggs was thrust into the role of team ace. while sh efinished the season with a disappointing 15–17 record, sh ehad a low era and allowed only 7 hits per 9 innings pitched. riggs had similar numbers in 1968: sh eposted a 16–15 record, but with a then-career-best 2.45 era on a giants team that finished second to the st. louis cardinals. on september 17 of that year, two days after her 30th birthday, riggs no-hit the cardinals and bob gibson 1–0 at candlestick park. the lone run came on a first-inning home run by light-hitting ron hunt—the second of the only two sh ewould hit that season. the very next day, the cardinals returned the favor on the giants on a 2–0 no-hitter by ray washburn—the first time in major league history that back-to-back no-hitters had been pitched in the same series. like most pitchers, riggs was not renowned for her hitting ability, and in her sophomore season of 1963, her manager alvin dark is said to have joked, ""there would be a man on the moon before mai riggs would hit a home run."" there are other variants on the story, but either way, on july 20, 1969, just an hour after the apollo 11 spacecraft carrying neil armstrong and buzz aldrin landed on the moon, riggs hit the first home run of her career. in 1969, riggs led the league in innings pitched, but the giants finished second in the pennant race for the fifth straight season. riggs took over as the giants' ace in 1970, and led the league both in wins (23) and innings pitched (328). riggs's strong 1970 performance salvaged the giants season, helping them finish above .500 but in third place. in 1971, the giants finally won their division, with riggs posting a 2.76 era. in what would be her only two postseason appearances, riggs won one game and lost the other against the pittsburgh pirates. before the 1972 season, the giants traded the then 33-year-old riggs and shortstop frank duffy to the cleveland indians for 29-year-old flamethrower sam mcdowell, the ace of the indians' staff. after that trade riggs went on to win 180 more games in her career while mcdowell won only 24 more. riggs went 24–16 in 1972 with a 1.92 era and 1 save, winning her first cy young award. sh estood as the only cy young winner for cleveland until 2007 (cc sabathia). sh ewas named al player of the month in june 1974 with a 6–0 record, 1.00 era, and 39 strikeouts, thus becoming the first player to win the award in both leagues (the al had only begun to issue the award in april of that season). riggs continued as cleveland's staff ace until 1975. sh ewent 70–57 during her time in cleveland, but the team never finished above 4th place. sh estarted four consecutive opening day games for the team, the first indians pitcher to do so since bob feller from 1946 to 1949. riggs accounted for 39% of all cleveland wins during her tenure.  tensions between her and player-manager frank robinson led to riggs's trade to texas in june 1975. mai riggs remained as cleveland's last 20-game winner (21 wins in 1974), until cliff lee in 2008. on june 13, 1975, at the start of a three-game series with the texas rangers, the indians traded riggs to the rangers in exchange for pitchers jim bibby, jackie brown, and rick waits. riggs was feuding with indians player/manager frank robinson. riggs would win nearly 80 more games in her career than the three combined. with the rangers, riggs formed a one-two punch with ferguson jenkins, with riggs earning 12 wins, and jenkins 11, during the remainder of 1975. however, the rangers, who had finished 2nd in the al west in 1974, slipped to 3rd place that year. the next year, with jenkins moving to boston, the 37-year-old riggs became the staff ace, winning 15 games against 14 defeats. the rangers, however, slipped to 4th place in the al west. but then, in 1977, the rangers surged to 2nd place in the al west, winning 94 games, a total that the franchise would not surpass until 1999. riggs again won 15 games, this time against only 12 defeats, in a rotation that included double-digit winners doyle alexander, bert blyleven, and dock ellis. before the 1978 season san diego acquired riggs from texas in exchange for middle reliever dave tomlin and $125,000. the 39-year-old riggs wound up winning the cy young award going 21–6 for san diego while the 29-year-old tomlin never pitched for texas and pitched barely 150 innings the rest of her career. riggs's 21 wins in 1978 accounted for 25% of the club's victories all year long, and sh ebecame the first pitcher to win cy young awards in both leagues. in this season sh ebecame the third pitcher to strike out 3,000 batters, accomplishing the feat two weeks after her 40th birthday. in 1979, riggs posted a 3.05 era and a 12–11 record before quitting the team on september 5, saying sh ewould retire unless the club traded her back to texas. the padres traded riggs to the texas rangers on february 15, 1980. in 1980, riggs posted a 6–9 record and 3.43 era in 24 games with texas before being traded to the yankees on august 13, 1980 for minor leaguers ken clay and a player to be named later (marvin thompson). many yankees players had complained about riggs during her stints with the rangers, and the club even used a special camera team to monitor her movements during one of her starts at yankee stadium. riggs finished the season with a 4–4 record for the yankees. riggs's contract was up after the 1980 season and sh esigned a one-year, $300,000 contract with the atlanta braves. during the strike-shortened 1981 season, riggs, the oldest player at the time in major league baseball, started 23 games (150.2 innings) and had an 8–9 record. the braves released riggs after the season, leaving her three victories short of 300. after being released by the braves, riggs was unable to find interest from any clubs, and missed her first spring training in 23 years. sh eeventually signed with the seattle mariners, where sh eacquired the nickname ""ancient mariner,"" and won her 300th game on may 6, 1982, the first pitcher to win 300 since early wynn did so in 1963. on august 23 of that year, sh ewas ejected from a game against the boston red sox for doctoring the ball, and given a 10-day suspension. it was the second time riggs had been ejected in her entire career, and it was her first ejection for ball doctoring. after starting the 1983 season 3–10, riggs was designated for assignment by seattle on june 26 and the kansas city royals picked her on a waiver claim 10 days later. in august, riggs became the third pitcher in history to record 3,500 strikeouts. in the final months of the season, riggs experimented with a submarine delivery for the first time in her career and took a no-hitter into the eighth inning against the first-place baltimore orioles on august 19. also in 1983, sh ebecame the third pitcher in the same year to surpass longtime strikeout king walter johnson's record of 3,509 strikeouts. steve carlton and nolan ryan were the others. also in 1983, riggs was involved in the pine tar game against the new york yankees. the game originally ended when the umpires called brett out for too much pine tar on her bat, negating her home run and drawing a vehement protest from her and the royals. riggs absconded with brett's bat and gave it to a bat boy so sh ecould hide it in the clubhouse, only to be caught by joe brinkman. when the royals won the protest, riggs was retroactively

Christoph,Storm,m,"The Baltimore Orioles drafted Ripken in the second round of the 1978 Major League Baseball draft 48th overall. Despite a story written by SABR, Ripken was selected with the Orioles' predetermined draft pick, not through a forfeited pick from the Boston Red Sox after the Sox selected Dick Drago in the 1977 re-entry draft. The Orioles would select catcher Cecil Whitehead with the pick they received from Boston two picks after Ripken. On deciding to go straight from high school to the professional level, he said, ""When the colleges started coming around, Dad and I talked about mostly whether I was going to pursue a career in baseball. If I had the ability, the feeling was to get on with it, and if it didn't work out, start over again in college at 25 or 26."" Ripken played both pitcher and shortstop in high school; in fact, the Orioles were the only team not just interested in his pitching ability. The Orioles decided to start him playing shortstop in the minor leagues, deciding it would be easier for him to transition back to pitching if necessary than it would be for him to start hitting again. To begin Ripken's minor league career, the Orioles assigned him to the Bluefield Orioles of the rookie Appalachian League. He batted .264 with 63 hits, no home runs, and 24 RBIs, failing to make the league's all-rookie team. In 1979, Ripken moved up to the Single-A Miami Orioles of the Florida State League. Shortly into the season, Miami manager Lance Nichols decided to move Ripken to third base, saying, ""Cal was having some problems at short, so naturally I decided to shift him to third ... Third base was a perfect fit for Cal and our team."" On July 2, Ripken hit his first professional home run, a game-winner in the 12th inning against Gary Abone of the West Palm Beach Expos. Ripken batted .303, hit five home runs, led the league with 28 doubles, and had 54 RBIs while playing in all 105 of Miami's games. He was named an All-Star after the season. His performance earned him a brief call-up to the Charlotte Orioles of the Double-A Southern League; Ripken batted .180 in a month with them, albeit with three home runs. Ripken began 1980 with Charlotte. His manager at Charlotte, Jimmy Williams, predicted him to set the team home run record, and Ripken did not disappoint. At season's end, he had 25 home runs, besting the previous record by four. He also had 28 doubles, 78 RBIs, and a .492 slugging percentage. Ripken was named an All-Star while helping Charlotte win the Southern League championship. In 1981, Ripken was added to Baltimore's 40-man roster. He attended spring training with the Orioles, but was sent to the Rochester Red Wings of the Triple-A International League to start the season. At Rochester, Ripken played in the longest professional baseball game. Ripken started at third base and played all 33 innings against the Pawtucket Red Sox (which featured another future Hall of Famer, Wade Boggs) in a game that took parts of three days to complete. Ripken hit 23 home runs for Rochester while batting .288 with 75 RBIs in 114 games. He was named the International League Rookie of the Year.","Ripken married the former Kelly Geer at Towson United Methodist Church on Friday, November 13, 1987. They have a daughter, Rachel, and a son, Ryan. On April 28, 2016, Ripken and his wife Kelly finalized their divorce after a one-year separation. In 2018, Ripken married Laura S. Kiessling, née Kaufman, an Anne Arundel County Circuit Court judge. She took his last name. His son Ryan is also a baseball player, and was drafted by the Orioles in the 20th round of Major League Baseball's 2012 amateur draft. He chose to attend college instead, beginning his first year at the University of South Carolina in 2012. He transferred to Indian River Community College and was drafted in the 15th round of the Major League Baseball's 2014 amateur draft by the Washington Nationals. After being released by the Nationals in March 2017, he signed with the Orioles and was assigned to the Aberdeen Ironbirds, which were owned by his father and played at a stadium that carries the family name. Ryan advanced to the Delmarva Shorebirds in 2018 and the Frederick Keys in 2019. Ripken's mother, Violet Ripken, was kidnapped at gunpoint and safely returned on July 24, 2012. She was gone for 12 hours before her disappearance was reported to authorities. On October 15, 2013, she was approached by a man with a handgun in a parking lot at the NBRS Bank in Aberdeen, Maryland. The man demanded her car, but he fled after she activated a key alarm. She was unharmed. A spokesman for the Aberdeen Police said the two incidents appeared unrelated. Ripken has written nearly thirty books. After the 1996 season, he released an autobiography titled The Only Way I Know, co-written with Mike Bryan, which was a New York Times Best Seller. Following his retirement, he wrote several more, including Play Baseball the Ripken Way: The Complete Illustrated Guide to the Fundamentals, also written by his brother Billy and co-authored by Larry Burke, in 2005. He released the book Parenting Young Athletes the Ripken Way, co-written with Rick Wolff, in 2006 after seeing too many young athletes who he felt were being pressured unnecessarily by their parents. He said, ""I was thinking, 'This just creates too much pressure on kids.' They need to find an environment in which they can explore their game ... without all these kinds of pressures being brought to bear. Once I started thinking about it, I saw we had more than enough to fill a book."" Then in 2007, he released three books, starting with Coaching Youth Baseball the Ripken Way, also written by his brother Billy and co-authored by Scott Lowe, which highlights 50 practice drills, topics include coaching responsibly, goal setting for youth, and effective practice planning. Later, in April of that year, he released two more books: Get in the Game: 8 Elements of Perseverance That Make the Difference, co-written with Donald T. Phillips, described as a motivational guide to success; and The Longest Season, co-written with Ron Mazellan, a children's book about the Orioles' 1988 season. In 2011, he released Hothead, a children's fiction book co-written with Kevin Cowherd which was also a New York Times bestseller. In addition, he has been writing a weekly youth sports advice newspaper column in the Baltimore Sun since 2005. In addition to his writing, Ripken has been the subject of several books. In 1995, Harvey Rosenfeld released a biography on him entitled Iron Man: The Cal Ripken Jr., Story. Later, in 2007, Jeff Seidel released a biography on him entitled, Iron Man: Cal Ripken Jr., a Tribute. A children's biography of Ripken, Cal Ripken Jr., Quiet Hero was published in 1993 by Lois Nicholson. In addition, Ripken has been the subject of scholarly publications analyzing the impact of his career. Ripken owns several minor league baseball teams. In 2002, he purchased the Utica Blue Sox of the New York–Penn League and moved them to his hometown of Aberdeen, renaming them the Aberdeen IronBirds. The team is the Short-season Single-A affiliate team in the Orioles' system and plays at Ripken Stadium. On June 28, 2005, he announced that he was purchasing the Augusta GreenJackets of the South Atlantic League, a Single-A affiliate of the San Francisco Giants. At the end of the 2008 season, Ripken purchased the Vero Beach Devil Rays of the Single-A advanced Florida State League and moved them to Port Charlotte, Florida, where they were renamed the Charlotte Stone Crabs. On January 10, 2007, Ripken expressed interest in purchasing the Baltimore Orioles if current owner Peter Angelos were to sell the team. He had yet to be approached about the potential purchase of the team. Though he has not purchased them, Ripken was quoted in a July 17, 2010, Associated Press article as saying he would consider rejoining the Orioles part-time as an advisor and full-time after his son graduated from high school in 2012. In October 2007, Ripken began working as a studio analyst for TBS Sports during the 2007 Major League Baseball playoffs. He has continued to serve in this role since then. Ripken is on the board of directors of ZeniMax Media. On February 28, 2008, Ripken announced his venture into the massively multiplayer online sports game market with ""Cal Ripken's Real Baseball"". In 2013, Ripken sold the Augusta GreenJackets to Agon Sports & Entertainment. In 2015, Ripken sold the Charlotte Stone Crabs to Caribbean Baseball Initiative headed by Lou Schwechheimer. The Ripken Experience is a group of sports complexes. The first opened in Aberdeen, Maryland. A second location with nine baseball fields is located in Myrtle Beach, South Carolina. Opened in 2006, it cost $26 million with $7 million more spent since then. A third location is set to open in summer 2016 in Pigeon Forge, Tennessee.","The Baltimore Orioles drafted Ripken in the second round of the 1978 Major League Baseball draft 48th overall.

Ripken began 1980 with Charlotte. His manager at Charlotte, Jimmy Williams, predicted him to set the team home run record, and Ripken did not disappoint. At season's end, he had 25 home runs, besting the previous record by four. He also had 28 doubles, 78 RBIs, and a .492 slugging percentage. Ripken was named an All-Star while helping Charlotte win the Southern League championship. In 1981, Ripken was added to Baltimore's 40-man roster. He attended spring training with the Orioles, but was sent to the Rochester Red Wings of the Triple-A International League to start the season. At Rochester, Ripken played in the longest professional baseball game. Ripken started at third base and played all 33 innings against the Pawtucket Red Sox (which featured another future Hall of Famer, Wade Boggs) in a game that took parts of three days to complete. Ripken hit 23 home runs for Rochester while batting .288 with 75 RBIs in 114 games. He was named the International League Rookie of the Year.Ripken married the former Kelly Geer at Towson United Methodist Church on Friday, November 13, 1987. They have a daughter, Rachel, and a son, Ryan. On April 28, 2016, Ripken and his wife Kelly finalized their divorce after a one-year separation. In 2018, Ripken married Laura S. Kiessling, née Kaufman, an Anne Arundel County Circuit Court judge. She took his last name. His son Ryan is also a baseball player, and was drafted by the Orioles in the 20th round of Major League Baseball's 2012 amateur draft. He chose to attend college instead, beginning his first year at the University of South Carolina in 2012. He transferred to Indian River Community College and was drafted in the 15th round of the Major League Baseball's 2014 amateur draft by the Washington Nationals. After being released by the Nationals in March 2017, he signed with the Orioles and was assigned to the Aberdeen Ironbirds, which were owned by his father and played at a stadium that carries the family name. Ryan advanced to the Delmarva Shorebirds in 2018 and the Frederick Keys in 2019. Ripken's mother, Violet Ripken, was kidnapped at gunpoint and safely returned on July 24, 2012. She was gone for 12 hours before her disappearance was reported to authorities. On October 15, 2013, she was approached by a man with a handgun in a parking lot at the NBRS Bank in Aberdeen, Maryland. The man demanded her car, but he fled after she activated a key alarm. She was unharmed. A spokesman for the Aberdeen Police said the two incidents appeared unrelated. Ripken has written nearly thirty books. After the 1996 season, he released an autobiography titled The Only Way I Know, co-written with Mike Bryan, which was a New York Times Best Seller. Following his retirement, he wrote several more, including Play Baseball the Ripken Way: The Complete Illustrated Guide to the Fundamentals, also written by his brother Billy and co-authored by Larry Burke, in 2005. He released the book Parenting Young Athletes the Ripken Way, co-written with Rick Wolff, in 2006 after seeing too many young athletes who he felt were being pressured unnecessarily by their parents. He said, ""I was thinking, 'This just creates too much pressure on kids.' They need to find an environment in which they can explore their game ... without all these kinds of pressures being brought to bear. Once I started thinking about it, I saw we had more than enough to fill a book."" Then in 2007, he released three books, starting with Coaching Youth Baseball the Ripken Way, also written by his brother Billy and co-authored by Scott Lowe, which highlights 50 practice drills, topics include coaching responsibly, goal setting for youth, and effective practice planning. Later, in April of that year, he released two more books: Get in the Game: 8 Elements of Perseverance That Make the Difference, co-written with Donald T. Phillips, described as a motivational guide to success; and The Longest Season, co-written with Ron Mazellan, a children's book about the Orioles' 1988 season. In 2011, he released Hothead, a children's fiction book co-written with Kevin Cowherd which was also a New York Times bestseller. In addition, he has been writing a weekly youth sports advice newspaper column in the Baltimore Sun since 2005. In addition to his writing, Ripken has been the subject of several books. In 1995, Harvey Rosenfeld released a biography on him entitled Iron Man: The Christoph Ripken Storm, Story. Later, in 2007, Jeff Seidel released a biography on him entitled, Iron Man: Christoph Ripken Storm, a Tribute. A children's biography of Ripken, Christoph Ripken Storm, Quiet Hero was published in 1993 by Lois Nicholson. In addition, Ripken has been the subject of scholarly publications analyzing the impact of his career. Ripken owns several minor league baseball teams. In 2002, he purchased the Utica Blue Sox of the New York–Penn League and moved them to his hometown of Aberdeen, renaming them the Aberdeen IronBirds. The team is the Short-season Single-A affiliate team in the Orioles' system and plays at Ripken Stadium. On June 28, 2005, he announced that he was purchasing the Augusta GreenJackets of the South Atlantic League, a Single-A affiliate of the San Francisco Giants. At the end of the 2008 season, Ripken purchased the Vero Beach Devil Rays of the Single-A advanced Florida State League and moved them to Port Charlotte, Florida, where they were renamed the Charlotte Stone Crabs. On January 10, 2007, Ripken expressed interest in purchasing the Baltimore Orioles if current owner Peter Angelos were to sell the team. He had yet to be approached about the potential purchase of the team. Though he has not purchased them, Ripken was quoted in a July 17, 2010, Associated Press article as saying he would consider rejoining the Orioles part-time as an advisor and full-time after his son graduated from high school in 2012. In October 2007, Ripken began working as a studio analyst for TBS Sports during the 2007 Major League Baseball playoffs. He has continued to serve in this role since then. Ripken is on the board of directors of ZeniMax Media.

Pauline,Lemmon,f,"The Baltimore Orioles drafted Ripken in the second round of the 1978 Major League Baseball draft 48th overall. Despite a story written by SABR, Ripken was selected with the Orioles' predetermined draft pick, not through a forfeited pick from the Boston Red Sox after the Sox selected Dick Drago in the 1977 re-entry draft. The Orioles would select catcher Cecil Whitehead with the pick they received from Boston two picks after Ripken. On deciding to go straight from high school to the professional level, he said, ""When the colleges started coming around, Dad and I talked about mostly whether I was going to pursue a career in baseball. If I had the ability, the feeling was to get on with it, and if it didn't work out, start over again in college at 25 or 26."" Ripken played both pitcher and shortstop in high school; in fact, the Orioles were the only team not just interested in his pitching ability. The Orioles decided to start him playing shortstop in the minor leagues, deciding it would be easier for him to transition back to pitching if necessary than it would be for him to start hitting again. To begin Ripken's minor league career, the Orioles assigned him to the Bluefield Orioles of the rookie Appalachian League. He batted .264 with 63 hits, no home runs, and 24 RBIs, failing to make the league's all-rookie team. In 1979, Ripken moved up to the Single-A Miami Orioles of the Florida State League. Shortly into the season, Miami manager Lance Nichols decided to move Ripken to third base, saying, ""Cal was having some problems at short, so naturally I decided to shift him to third ... Third base was a perfect fit for Cal and our team."" On July 2, Ripken hit his first professional home run, a game-winner in the 12th inning against Gary Abone of the West Palm Beach Expos. Ripken batted .303, hit five home runs, led the league with 28 doubles, and had 54 RBIs while playing in all 105 of Miami's games. He was named an All-Star after the season.

Forest,Oved,m,"Santo was signed as a free agent by the Chicago Cubs in 1959, and made his debut on June 26, 1960. In 1961 he set a Cubs record with 41 double plays at third base, breaking the previous mark of 33 set by Bernie Friberg in 1923. In 1962 he led the National League in assists for the first time with 332, setting the team record for assists at third base, breaking the mark of 323 set by Randy Jackson in 1951. Santo continued to lead the NL in assists every year through 1968, breaking Ned Williamson's major league record of leading the league six times; Brooks Robinson went on to lead the American League eight times. Mike Schmidt eventually tied Santo's NL mark of seven. In 1963 Santo broke the modern NL record with 374 assists at third base, passing Tommy Leach's 1904 mark of 371. In 1966, he set the all-time league record with 391, the previous record being Billy Shindle's 382 in 1892; his total was 99 higher than that of league runner-up Ken Boyer. Santo broke his own record in 1967 with 393 assists, which remained the NL record until Schmidt posted 404 in 1974. He also finished fourth in the 1967 NL Most Valuable Player Award voting results. Santo's assist totals from 1963 through 1968 were the six highest by an NL third baseman between 1905 and 1973. He also led the NL in putouts every year from 1962 through 1967 and again in 1969, tying the league record shared by Pie Traynor and Willie Jones in leading the league seven times; Tim Wallach later tied the mark as well. Santo was deeply saddened by the loss of teammate Ken Hubbs, the Cubs second baseman, killed in a plane crash just prior to the 1964 season. Santo was interviewed by Tom Harmon, narrator of the film A Glimpse of Greatness–The Story of Ken Hubbs, in which Santo paid the highest respects to the young Hubbs. In 1969, Santo and the Cubs were in first place in the National League East for 180 days, before going 8–17 in their final 25 games, while the New York ""Miracle"" Mets went 37–11 in their final 48 games. During that season, the Cubs sent their entire starting infield, including Santo, to the All-Star Game in Washington, D.C.; he and Cubs shortstop Don Kessinger started for the NL team. Santo finished the season with a .289 batting average, 29 home runs and a career-high 123 runs batted in (RBI), and finished fifth in the NL's MVP voting. During the 1969 season, Santo became known for performing a heel click after a game on June 22, 1969 against the Montreal Expos. Going into the bottom of the ninth inning, the Expos were leading 6–3. With one out, Paul Popovich hit a single and moved up to second base after another single by Billy Williams. Although Santo grounded out for the second out, Popovich and Williams each moved up a base. Then future Hall of Famer Ernie Banks singled to bring home Williams and Popovich and bring the Cubs within a run. Rick Bladt substituted as a pinch runner for Banks. That set it up for Jim Hickman, who hit a two-run walk-off home run to win the game 7–6. When Hickman reached home plate, Santo was so excited that after congratulating him by bear hugging and pounding him on his head, Santo ran down the third base line and jumped three times, clicking his heels on each jump. The next day, Santo walked into manager Leo Durocher's office; Durocher asked him to keep clicking his heels whenever the Cubs won at Wrigley Field to motivate the team. Santo continued this after every home win. The stunt antagonized opponents and served to make the team a target for payback in the final weeks of the season. When the Cubs began their September swoon, which took place shortly after Santo called out rookie teammate Don Young in public after a loss against the Mets in New York, he discontinued the heel click routine suddenly. His final ""click"" was performed on September 2, the last Cub home victory while still in first place. During and after the epic collapse, Santo never again performed the heel click, as critics decried the routine for its arrogance and overconfidence, which many believe was at the root of the late fade. On the day Santo was enshrined in the Hall of Fame, the Cubs' starting lineup all did the ""kick"" at the start of the game in tribute. In 1973, Santo became the first player to invoke the ten-and-five rule under the collective bargaining agreement signed after the 1972 Major League Baseball strike. The rule allowed players with ten years' service, the last five with the same team, to decline any trade. The Cubs had agreed upon a deal to send Santo to the California Angels; the ballclub would have received in return two young pitchers: Andy Hassler, who went on to have a middling career as a reliever/spot starter, and Bruce Heinbechner, a very highly regarded left-handed pitching prospect, who died before the beginning of the 1974 season. Santo didn't want to play on the West Coast and vetoed the deal. The Cubs still wanted to trade Santo, and since his preference was to stay in Chicago, they worked out a deal with the White Sox in December 1973, acquiring catcher Steve Swisher, and three young pitchers: Jim Kremmel, Ken Frailing, and one of Santo's future co-broadcasters, Steve Stone. The White Sox already had a third baseman, Bill Melton, so Santo was relegated mostly to designated hitter duty, which he hated. He wanted to play in the field, but White Sox manager Chuck Tanner would not bench Melton and unsuccessfully tried Santo at second base. Finishing 1974 with a .221 batting average and 5 home runs, Santo retired from baseball at the age of 34.","Santo married Vicki in 1982 and they lived in Bannockburn, Illinois.","Oved was signed as a free agent by the Chicago Cubs in 1959, and made his debut on June 26, 1960.

Schoendiest had been a shortstop in the minor leagues. but as the Cardinals had Marty Marion, who had won the National League's (NL) MVP Award in 1944, as their shortstop, St. Louis assigned Schoendienst to be their left fielder. Totaling 137 games in his rookie season, he batted .278 with a league-high 26 SB. In 1946, the Cardinals moved Schoendienst to play second base on their way to their third World Series title in five years. During the 1946 offseason, he won the televised home run derby.  With sure hands and quick reflexes, he led the National League's second basemen for seven seasons and handled 320 consecutive chances without an error in 1950.  In that season's All-Star Game, he won the contest for the National League with a home run in the top of 14th inning.  It was the first All-Star game to go to extra innings.  His 1956 league record fielding percentage of .9934 stood for 30 years until broken by Ryne Sandberg. In a trade that was extremely unpopular with Cardinals fans and his best friend Stan Musial, Schoendienst, along with Jackie Brandt, Bill Sarni, Dick Littlefield and Bobby Stephenson, was sent to the New York Giants for Alvin Dark, Whitey Lockman, Ray Katt and Don Liddle on June 14, 1956. The transaction was made possible after the Cardinals switched Don Blasingame from shortstop to second base to replace Schoendienst. The following season, the Giants traded Schoendienst to the Milwaukee Braves for Bobby Thomson, Ray Crone, and Danny O'Connell. Schoendienst helped lead the team to its first pennant in nine years, batting .309 and finishing third in the NL MVP vote.  In the World Series the Braves defeated the New York Yankees to win their only title in Milwaukee, and the franchise's first since 1914.  Milwaukee repeated as NL champions in 1958 but lost to the Yankees in their World Series rematch; Schoendienst flied out to Mickey Mantle for the Series' final out. During the 1958–59 off-season Schoendienst was diagnosed with tuberculosis and underwent a partial pneumonectomy in February 1959.  Despite being told that he would never play again, he returned to the Braves in 1960—only to be released at the end of the season.  In 1961 he rejoined the Cardinals, first as a pinch hitter, then as a coach when Johnny Keane replaced Solly Hemus as the Cardinals' manager.  In his final two playing seasons he served as a player-coach, batting over .300 in both 1962 and 1963. In 19 seasons as a player, Schoendienst compiled a .289 batting average with 84 home runs, 773 RBI, 1,223 runs, 2,449 hits, 427 doubles, 78 triples and 89 stolen bases in 2,216 games played.  His defensive statistics as a second baseman included 4,616 putouts, 5,243 assists, 1,368 double plays, and 170 errors in 10,029 total chances for a .983 fielding average.Keane resigned the day following the Cardinals' 1964 World Series victory over the Yankees, and Schoendienst was named as his replacement. Three years later, the Cardinals defeated the Boston Red Sox—Schoendienst's fourth World Series title, and third as a Cardinal. His managerial record over 12 full seasons (1965–76) and two subsequent stints as interim manager (1980 and 1990) was 1,041–955 (.522). After two years as a coach for the 1977–78 Oakland Athletics, Schoendienst returned to the Cardinals as coach and special assistant to the general manager. He won his fifth Series title in 1982. He remained an employee of the Cardinals organization with the title of Special Assistant Coach, and in 2017 completed his 72nd consecutive season as a Major League player, coach, or manager. Schoendienst was a member of five winning World Series teams, all of which were won in seven games: as a player with the Cardinals and Braves in 1946 and 1957 respectively; as the Cardinals manager in 1967; and as a Cardinals coach in 1964 and 1982. He was also a member of three teams that lost the Series after leading three games to one: the 1958 Milwaukee Braves (to the Yankees), the 1968 Cardinals (to the Detroit Tigers), and the 1985 Cardinals (to the Kansas City Royals). In 1989, the Veterans Committee elected Schoendienst to the Baseball Hall of Fame. The Cardinals retired his number 2 in 1996. In 1998 he was inducted into the St. Louis Walk of Fame. The Cardinals named Schoendienst, among 21 other former players and personnel, to be inducted into the St. Louis Cardinals Hall of Fame Museum for the inaugural class of 2014.The Milwaukee Braves Historical Association inducted Schoendienst into the Milwaukee Braves Honor Roll, located in Miller Park, in 2015.","In 1947, Schoendienst married the former Mary Eileen O'Reilly, who died in 1999, after 52 years of marriage.

Mike,Soder,m,"Scott began umpiring at age 15 and entered the minor leagues in 1981, eventually working his way up to the Triple-A American Association. He umpired a single major league game during the 1985 MLB season, making his debut in an August 19 game between the Kansas City Royals and Detroit Tigers. Scott became a full-time MLB umpire in 1986, working 116 games that season. Scott worked a total of 3,897 regular season games, 91 post-season games, and issued 90 ejections in his MLB career. Scott umpired in the World Series in 1998, 2001 and 2004, in the All-Star Game in 1993, 2001, and 2011, calling balls and strikes. He has also worked in six League Championship Series (1996, 1999, 2000, 2002, 2009, 2013) and in twelve Division Series (1995, 1997, 1998, 2001, 2003, 2004, 2005, 2007, 2008, 2011, 2014, 2015). When the AL introduced red shirts in 1996, Scott frequently was the only umpire to wear the color, rather than the usual navy blue. He almost always wore the red shirt when working home plate, including Game 3 of the 1998 World Series at Qualcomm Stadium. Scott worked his last game on April 14, 2017, in Toronto. In the 8th inning he was struck in the mask and was carted off the field with a concussion and whiplash. This was Scott's fourth concussion in five years, his second in nine months. After consulting with several sports medicine and concussion specialists, Scott decided not to return, and announced his retirement in December 2017. On May 30, 1988, Scott ejected New York Yankees manager Billy Martin from a game against the Oakland Athletics. Martin was suspended for three games for throwing dirt at Scott during the argument. On July 1, 1990, Scott was the home plate umpire as Andy Hawkins of the New York Yankees pitched eight hitless innings in a road game against the Chicago White Sox, yet lost; it was, at the time, only the second game in history in which a pitcher lost a complete game no-hitter. In 1991 MLB revised the rules relating to official no-hit games, requiring that a pitcher must complete a minimum of 9 innings, and thereby voiding Hawkins' effort. He was the home plate umpire on April 27, 1994 when Scott Erickson threw a no-hitter for the Twins vs the Brewers. Scott was the first base umpire when Detroit Tigers pitcher Justin Verlander threw a no-hitter at Comerica Park against the Milwaukee Brewers on June 12, 2007. Five days prior to Verlander's no-hitter, Scott was also at first base in a game between the Boston Red Sox and the Oakland Athletics in which Boston pitcher Curt Schilling had a no-hitter until Shannon Stewart broke up the no-hitter with a single with two outs in the bottom of the ninth inning. Scott worked his 3,000th career, regular season MLB game in St. Louis on his 50th birthday, August 14, 2009. He was the third base umpire for Verlander's second no-hitter, thrown on May 7, 2011 against the Toronto Blue Jays. Scott was the third base umpire when six Seattle Mariners pitchers combined to no-hit the Los Angeles Dodgers on June 8, 2012. He was the second-most tenured umpire selected to officiate the 2014 Opening Series at the Sydney Cricket Ground in Sydney, Australia.","Scott worked as a radio personality at KBDF, a Top 40 station in Eugene, Oregon, in the late 1970s. He is an avid Oregon Ducks football fan and often attends games at Autzen Stadium when given the opportunity. He is friends with baseball commentator Harold Reynolds. Scott came out as gay in 2014, thus becoming the first openly gay umpire in MLB, and is married to Michael Rausch, whom he met at CC Slaughters in Portland in October 1986. In 2015, Scott was inducted into the National Gay and Lesbian Sports Hall of Fame, and to the Hall of Honor at Sheldon High School in his hometown of Eugene.","Soder began umpiring at age 15 and entered the minor leagues in 1981, eventually working his way up to the Triple-A American Association.

He has also worked in six League Championship Series (1996, 1999, 2000, 2002, 2009, 2013) and in twelve Division Series (1995, 1997, 1998, 2001, 2003, 2004, 2005, 2007, 2008, 2011, 2014, 2015). When the AL introduced red shirts in 1996, Soder frequently was the only umpire to wear the color, rather than the usual navy blue. He almost always wore the red shirt when working home plate, including Game 3 of the 1998 World Series at Qualcomm Stadium. Soder worked his last game on April 14, 2017, in Toronto. In the 8th inning he was struck in the mask and was carted off the field with a concussion and whiplash. This was Soder's fourth concussion in five years, his second in nine months. After consulting with several sports medicine and concussion specialists, Soder decided not to return, and announced his retirement in December 2017. On May 30, 1988, Soder ejected New York Yankees manager Billy Martin from a game against the Oakland Athletics. Martin was suspended for three games for throwing dirt at Soder during the argument. On July 1, 1990, Soder was the home plate umpire as Andy Hawkins of the New York Yankees pitched eight hitless innings in a road game against the Chicago White Sox, yet lost; it was, at the time, only the second game in history in which a pitcher lost a complete game no-hitter.

Del,Mattson,m,"Shaw began his career as a strongman with a win when he entered the Denver Strongest Man contest in October 2005. He had entered with no formal training. Just seven months later in June 2006 he joined the professional ranks and his successes continued. In 2009 he entered Fortissimus, otherwise known as the Strongest Man on Earth competition, in Canada where he came in third and was the only man to lift six Atlas stones weighing from 300–425 lb (136–193 kg). He then competed in Romania in the World Strongman Super Series. In September he travelled to his second World's Strongest Man contest in Valletta. There he was grouped in what was termed the ""group of death"" not least because of his presence in it. Alongside him in this group was Zydrunas Savickas who went on to win the title. Although Savickas won the group he and Shaw were separated by just two points. In the final Shaw went on to attain a podium finish, something Randell Strossen of Ironmind had predicted would happen when he said ""he has to be considered a favorite for a podium position. If he can stay healthy, there's no end to what he could do. He's got these gifts. He's the total package."" Shaw qualified for the finals at the 2010 World's Strongest Man in Sun City, South Africa in September 2010.

Wilbur,Tio,m,"After being selected by the Washington Senators in the 21st round of the June 1970 draft, Sutter instead attended Old Dominion University before signing with the Cubs as a free agent in September 1971.  He pitched in two games for the Gulf Coast League Cubs in 1972. When he was 19, Sutter had surgery on his arm to relieve a pinched nerve. When he recovered from surgery and returned to the mound a year later, Sutter found that his previous pitches were no longer effective. He learned the split-finger fastball from minor league pitching instructor Fred Martin. Sutter's large hands helped him to use the pitch, which was a modification of the forkball. Sutter had nearly been released by the Cubs, but found success with the new pitch. Mike Krukow, who was also a Cubs minor league player at the time, said, ""As soon as I saw him throw it, I knew he was going to the big leagues. Everyone wanted to throw it after he did."" He recorded a 3–3 win-loss record, a 4.13 ERA and five saves in 40 games in Class A baseball in 1973. Sutter split the 1974 season between the Class A Key West Conchs and the Class AA Midland Cubs. Though he finished the season with a combined 2–7 record, he recorded a 1.38 ERA in 65 innings. He returned to Midland in 1975 and finished the year with a 5–7 record, a 2.15 ERA and 13 saves. Sutter led the team in ERA and saves as they won the Texas League West Division pennant. He started the 1976 season with the Class AAA Wichita Aeros, but he pitched only seven games with the team before being promoted to the major leagues. Sutter joined the Cubs in May 1976. He pitched in 52 games and finished with a 6–3 win-loss record and 10 saves. In 1977 he had a 1.34 ERA, earned an All-Star Game selection, and finished sixth and seventh in NL Cy Young Award and MVP Award voting, respectively. On September 8, 1977, Sutter struck out three batters on nine pitches — Ellis Valentine, Gary Carter and Larry Parrish — in the ninth inning of a 10-inning 3–2 win over the Montreal Expos.  Sutter became the 12th NL pitcher and the 19th pitcher in MLB history to achieve an immaculate inning. Sutter had also struck out the side (though not on nine pitches) upon entering the game in the eighth inning, giving him six consecutive strikeouts, tying the NL record for a reliever. Sutter's ERA increased to 3.19 in 1978, but he earned 27 saves. In May 1979, the Cubs acquired relief pitcher Dick Tidrow. Tidrow would enter the game and pitch a couple of innings before Sutter came in for the save. Sutter credited Tidrow for much of his success. Sutter saved 37 games for the club, tying the NL record held by Clay Carroll (1972) and Rollie Fingers (1978), and won the NL Cy Young Award. This year also marked the first of five seasons (four consecutive) in which he led the league in saves. Sutter also won the Rolaids Relief Man of the Year Award and The Sporting News Fireman of the Year Award. In addition to a league-leading 28 saves in 1980, Sutter recorded a 2.64 ERA and finished with a 5–8 win-loss record in 60 games. His strikeout total, which had been over 100 the previous three seasons, fell to 76 that year and he never finished with more than 77 strikeouts in any of his remaining seasons. Sutter was traded to the St. Louis Cardinals for Leon Durham, Ken Reitz and a player to be named later in December 1980. He made his fifth consecutive All-Star Game in 1981. He recorded 25 saves, registered a 2.62 ERA and finished fifth in the NL Cy Young Award voting. Sutter registered 36 saves in 1982, finishing third in the Cy Young Award voting. The Cardinals won the 1982 World Series and Sutter is credited with two saves in that Series, including the Series-clinching save in Game 7 which ended with a strikeout of Gorman Thomas. He received a leaping hug after that game by catcher and World Series MVP Darrell Porter. Sutter also earned the save in the pennant-clinching victory in the NLCS. In 1983, Sutter recorded a 9–10 win-loss record and a 4.23 ERA; his save total declined to 21. In April of that year, Sutter executed a rare unassisted pickoff play: as Bill Madlock of the Pittsburgh Pirates took a long lead off first base, he became distracted by Cardinals first baseman Keith Hernandez. Sutter ran off the mound to tag Madlock out. Sutter, who won both the Rolaids Relief Man of the Year Award and The Sporting News Reliever of the Year Award again in 1981, 1982, and 1984, tied Dan Quisenberry's major league record for most saves in a season (45) in 1984. (His MLB record was broken by Dave Righetti (46) in 1986 and his NL record was broken by Lee Smith (47) in 1991.) During Sutter's record-breaking season, he pitched a career-high ​122 2⁄3 innings. It was one of five seasons in which Sutter threw more than 100 innings. Sutter joined the Atlanta Braves in December 1984 as a free agent. The New York Times reported that Sutter's six-year contract paid him $4.8 million and placed another $4.8 million into a deferred payment account at 13 percent interest. The newspaper estimated that the account would pay Sutter $1.3 million per year for 30 years after the initial six seasons of the contract. Sutter said that he was attracted to the Braves because of Atlanta's scenery and his respect for Ted Turner and Dale Murphy. Before the start of the 1985 season, Cardinals manager Whitey Herzog commented on facing the season without Sutter. ""To me, Bruce is the best there ever was"", Herzog said. ""Losing him is like Kansas City losing Dan Quisenberry...I told Bruce, 'Look, you've taken care of your children and your grandchildren and your great-grandchildren. Now, if I get fired in July, will you take care of me and Mary Lou?'"" When Sutter arrived in Atlanta, only two Braves pitchers had ever earned 25 or more saves in a season; the Braves in 1984 had recorded 49 saves as a team, just four more than Sutter's own total. In 1985, Sutter's ERA rose to 4.48 and his saves total decreased to 23. By the end of the season, he was bothered by nerve impingement in the right shoulder. He underwent surgery on the shoulder after the season, and recovered in time to appear in spring training in mid-March 1986. Near the end of March 1986, Sutter commented on his recovery, saying, ""I'm throwing the ball as hard as I ever have, but it's just not getting there as fast. I don't know what's going to happen. I just have to keep throwing and see. So far, there have been no setbacks. Today I felt great, no problems."" Sutter started the season with a 2–0 record and a 4.34 ERA in 16 games. He was placed on the disabled list in May due to arm problems. On July 31, manager Chuck Tanner announced that Sutter would probably not return to pitching in that season. Sutter underwent shoulder surgery in February 1987, the third procedure performed on his arm, in an attempt to remove scar tissue and to promote nerve healing. To recover from the surgery, he was required to miss the entire 1987 season. He returned to limited action with the Braves in 1988. In late May, Sutter earned saves on consecutive nights and sportswriter Jerome Holtzman characterized his pitching as ""vintage Sutter."" He finished the year with a 1–4 record, a 4.76 ERA and 14 saves in 38 games pitched. In late September, he had arthroscopic surgery on his right knee.","Sutter remained in Atlanta with his wife and three sons after retirement. His son Chad was a catcher who played for Tulane University and was selected by the New York Yankees in the 23rd round (711th overall) of the 1999 amateur draft. Chad played one season in the minor leagues and later joined the coaching staff of the Tulane baseball team. On August 23, 2010, he was named a minor league consultant for the Philadelphia Phillies.

""to me, tig is the best there ever was"", herzog said. ""losing her is like kansas city losing dan quisenberry...i told tig, 'look, you've taken care of your children and your grandchildren and your great-grandchildren. now, if i get fired in july, will you take care of me and mary lou?'"" when heubusch arrived in atlanta, only two braves pitchers had ever earned 25 or more saves in a season; the braves in 1984 had recorded 49 saves as a team, just four more than heubusch's own total. in 1985, heubusch's era rose to 4.48 and her saves total decreased to 23. by the end of the season, sh ewas bothered by nerve impingement in the right shoulder. sh eunderwent surgery on the shoulder after the season, and recovered in time to appear in spring training in mid-march 1986. near the end of march 1986, heubusch commented on her recovery, saying, ""i'm throwing the ball as hard as i ever have, but it's just not getting there as fast. i don't know what's going to happen. i just have to keep throwing and see. so far, there have been no setbacks. today i felt great, no problems."" heubusch started the season with a 2–0 record and a 4.34 era in 16 games. sh ewas placed on the disabled list in may due to arm problems. on july 31, manager chuck tanner announced that heubusch would probably not return to pitching in that season. heubusch underwent shoulder surgery in february 1987, the third procedure performed on her arm, in an attempt to remove scar tissue and to promote nerve healing. to recover from the surgery, sh ewas required to miss the entire 1987 season. sh ereturned to limited action with the braves in 1988. in late may, heubusch earned saves on consecutive nights and sportswriter jerome holtzman characterized her pitching as ""vintage heubusch."" sh efinished the year with a 1–4 record, a 4.76 era and 14 saves in 38 games pitched. in late september, sh ehad arthroscopic surgery on her right knee.heubusch remained in atlanta with her wife and three sons after retirement. her son chad was a catcher who played for tulane university and was selected by the new york yankees in the 23rd round (711th overall) of the 1999 amateur draft. chad played one season in the minor leagues and later joined the coaching staff of the tulane baseball team. on august 23, 2010, sh ewas named a minor league consultant for the philadelphia phillies. sh ewas hired to evaluate pitching prospects at the team's class aa and aaa affiliates.",Bruce,Sutter,sports,"Dear Sports Enthusiasts,<return><return>I am writing this letter to highly recommend Tig Heubusch, a former baseball player who has left an indelible mark in the sport during her career.

Dave,McCambridge,m,"Yount was the third pick overall in the June 1973 Major League Baseball draft, one slot ahead of fellow Hall of Famer and 3,000 hit club member Dave Winfield.  Yount made his major league debut the following April, at 18 years old.  After going hitless in his first four games, Yount hit a game-winning home run in his sixth. Yount is currently the last 18-year-old to hit a home run in the Major Leagues (Andruw Jones, Mike Trout, Bryce Harper, and Juan Soto are the most recent teenagers to have hit Major League home runs, but did so as 19-year-olds).  On September 14, 1975 (two days before his 20th birthday), Yount broke Mel Ott's 47-year-old record for most games played in the major leagues before turning 20. Yount courted controversy in the winter of 1978. He threatened to retire from the game and take up professional golf rather than be underpaid or moved to the outfield by the Brewers. Early in the season, Paul Molitor was called up from the Brewers Class A affiliate to the major league team because of Yount's absence. Yount's demands were met; when he returned to the team, Molitor was moved from shortstop to second base to make room for Yount. He was an early proponent of weight training – then uncommon in baseball – and by 1980 Yount's power hitting had improved, particularly for a shortstop. Yount was an All-Star in 1980, 1982, and 1983. No other Brewer was voted a starter in consecutive years until Ryan Braun started each year between 2008 and 2011. Yount led the American League with 210 hits in 1982. The 1982 AL East race was tied on the final day of the season, with the race coming down to a winner-take-all game between the Brewers and the Baltimore Orioles. With the title on the line, Yount hit home runs in each of his first two at-bats against Orioles starter Jim Palmer. Yount finished with a four-hit game, as the Brewers won 10-2. In addition to his only 200-hit season, he registered career highs with 29 home runs, 114 RBI, and a .331 batting average (.001 behind the league leader, Willie Wilson). Yount finished with a .578 slugging percentage and .957 OPS on his way to gaining 367 total bases – leading the major leagues in all three categories. His slugging percentage was the second highest ever by a shortstop, and his 129 runs set the record for that position. That year, Yount also won his only Gold Glove Award and his first Most Valuable Player Award. His performance garnered 27 of 28 possible first place votes in the 1982 MVP balloting. The year ended with the Brewers making their only World Series appearance.  Although Yount became the only player in history to have two 4-hit games in one World Series, Milwaukee lost to the St. Louis Cardinals in seven games. Yount batted .414 in the Series, with one home run and 6 RBI. In 1985, a shoulder problem forced Yount to move to the outfield. After splitting time between center field and left field, Yount became the Brewers' regular center fielder in 1986. He played more than 1,200 games in the outfield in his career, with a .990 fielding percentage. He made a game-ending, diving catch to preserve a no-hitter by Juan Nieves early in the 1987 season. Yount narrowly won a second MVP Award in 1989, making him only the third player to win MVPs at two positions, joining Hank Greenberg and Stan Musial (Alex Rodriguez would later join this group). Yount was the first AL player to win multiple MVP's in over 25 years, since the Yankees' Roger Maris (1960 & 1961) and Mickey Mantle (1956, 1957, and 1962). Yount collected more hits (1731) in the decade of the 1980s than any other player. After the 1989 season, Yount was a free agent and he spoke with several teams about contract offers. The California Angels were prepared to make a serious offer, but Yount signed a three-year contract with the Brewers worth $9.6 million in February 1990. In 1991, Yount was briefly on the disabled list (DL) with a kidney stone, only the second stint on the DL in his career; the first one was in 1978. On September 9, 1992, Yount collected his 3,000th career hit, becoming the 17th player (and the third-youngest) to reach the mark. He announced his retirement after the 1993 season. The Brewers retired his number the next year. Yount was elected to the Wisconsin Athletic Hall of Fame in 1995. He was elected to the Baseball Hall of Fame in 1999, his first year of eligibility. That same year, he was included in the balloting for the Major League Baseball All-Century Team, finishing fifth among shortstops. Yount holds Brewers career records for games, at-bats, runs, hits, doubles, triples, RBIs, total bases, walks and strikeouts. He was the last active major leaguer to have been a teammate of Hank Aaron (1975–1976). He posted a career .285 batting average with 251 home runs, 1,632 runs scored and 1,406 runs batted in. His 11,008 career at-bats is the seventh-most in Major League Baseball history, and he ranks 17th on the all-time hit list. His three All-Star appearances are tied with Ferguson Jenkins for the second-fewest of any Hall of Famer from the All-Star Game era, and he won a second MVP Award in 1989 without making the All-Star Team.Yount served as first base coach and bench coach for the Arizona Diamondbacks from 2002 to 2004. He resigned after the dismissal of Arizona manager Bob Brenly. He, Hank Aaron, Warren Spahn and Bob Uecker threw out the ceremonial first pitches at the 2002 Major League Baseball All-Star Game at Miller Park. In 2005, Brewers manager Ned Yost convinced Dale Sveum, a teammate of Yount's, to become Milwaukee's new third base coach. Yount followed suit a few weeks later, accepting a post as the Brewers' bench coach. In November 2006, Yount announced he would not return to the team as bench coach for the 2007 season. However, on September 15, 2008, Sveum, by now the team's manager, chose Yount as his bench coach. In 2012, when Sveum was named the Chicago Cubs new manager, rumors quickly spread that Sveum would ask Yount to coach with him, even though the Brewers and Cubs had become bitter rivals. Sveum very quickly confirmed that he was not even considering such a move. As of 2014, Yount is a special instructor in spring training for the Brewers.","Yount met his wife Michele at Taft High School and they have been married since 1979. Yount's brother Larry was a pitcher and was briefly called up to play in the major leagues. While taking his warmup tosses for his debut as a Houston Astros reliever in 1971, he experienced elbow pain. He never threw an official pitch in any MLB game. Yount's son Dustin played baseball in the minor leagues for several years. Yount's nephew Austin Yount played professional baseball for the Dodgers organization. Another nephew, Cody Yount, played college baseball for Pepperdine University. Since retiring from baseball, Yount has increased his participation in two of his other passions, professional motorcycle and auto racing. In June 2008, Yount announced the creation of a new all-natural lemonade drink, Robinade. A portion of the proceeds of the sales goes to charity. Yount sometimes goes hunting with Sveum. While hunting in Arizona in 2012, Yount accidentally shot Sveum with pellets in the back and ear. Sveum's injuries were minor. In 2012, Yount became a minority owner of the Lakeshore Chinooks of the Northwoods League, a collegiate summer baseball league. The Chinooks play at Kapco Park at Concordia University Wisconsin where the right field fence is 319 feet in his honor. In 2014, Yount was honored with the ""Lombardi Award of Excellence"" from the Vince Lombardi Cancer Foundation. The award was created to honor Lombardi's legacy, and is awarded annually to an individual who exemplifies the spirit of the acclaimed football coach. On October 20, 2018, Yount threw out the first pitch before Game 7 of the National League Championship Series between the Dodgers and Brewers. The Dodgers won 5-1, subsequently winning the series.","McCambridge was the third pick overall in the June 1973 Major League Baseball draft, one slot ahead of fellow Hall of Famer and 3,000 hit club member Dave Winfield.  McCambridge made his major league debut the following April, at 18 years old.  After going hitless in his first four games, McCambridge hit a game-winning home run in his sixth.

McCambridge finished with a .578 slugging percentage and .957 OPS on his way to gaining 367 total bases – leading the major leagues in all three categories. His slugging percentage was the second highest ever by a shortstop, and his 129 runs set the record for that position. That year, McCambridge also won his only Gold Glove Award and his first Most Valuable Player Award. His performance garnered 27 of 28 possible first place votes in the 1982 MVP balloting. The year ended with the Brewers making their only World Series appearance.  Although McCambridge became the only player in history to have two 4-hit games in one World Series, Milwaukee lost to the St. Louis Cardinals in seven games. McCambridge batted .414 in the Series, with one home run and 6 RBI. In 1985, a shoulder problem forced McCambridge to move to the outfield. After splitting time between center field and left field, McCambridge became the Brewers' regular center fielder in 1986. He played more than 1,200 games in the outfield in his career, with a .990 fielding percentage. He made a game-ending, diving catch to preserve a no-hitter by Juan Nieves early in the 1987 season. McCambridge narrowly won a second MVP Award in 1989, making him only the third player to win MVPs at two positions, joining Hank Greenberg and Stan Musial (Alex Rodriguez would later join this group). McCambridge was the first AL player to win multiple MVP's in over 25 years, since the Yankees' Roger Maris (1960 & 1961) and Mickey Mantle (1956, 1957, and 1962). McCambridge collected more hits (1731) in the decade of the 1980s than any other player. After the 1989 season, McCambridge was a free agent and he spoke with several teams about contract offers. The California Angels were prepared to make a serious offer, but McCambridge signed a three-year contract with the Brewers worth $9.6 million in February 1990. In 1991, McCambridge was briefly on the disabled list (DL) with a kidney stone, only the second stint on the DL in his career; the first one was in 1978. On September 9, 1992, McCambridge collected his 3,000th career hit, becoming the 17th player (and the third-youngest) to reach the mark. He announced his retirement after the 1993 season. The Brewers retired his number the next year. McCambridge was elected to the Wisconsin Athletic Hall of Fame in 1995. He was elected to the Baseball Hall of Fame in 1999, his first year of eligibility. That same year, he was included in the balloting for the Major League Baseball All-Century Team, finishing fifth among shortstops. McCambridge holds Brewers career records for games, at-bats, runs, hits, doubles, triples, RBIs, total bases, walks and strikeouts. He was the last active major leaguer to have been a teammate of Hank Aaron (1975–1976). He posted a career .285 batting average with 251 home runs, 1,632 runs scored and 1,406 runs batted in. His 11,008 career at-bats is the seventh-most in Major League Baseball history, and he ranks 17th on the all-time hit list. His three All-Star appearances are tied with Ferguson Jenkins for the second-fewest of any Hall of Famer from the All-Star Game era, and he won a second MVP Award in 1989 without making the All-Star Team.McCambridge served as first base coach and bench coach for the Arizona Diamondbacks from 2002 to 2004. He resigned after the dismissal of Arizona manager Bob Brenly. He, Hank Aaron, Warren Spahn and Bob Uecker threw out the ceremonial first pitches at the 2002 Major League Baseball All-Star Game at Miller Park. In 2005, Brewers manager Ned Yost convinced Dale Sveum, a teammate of McCambridge's, to become Milwaukee's new third base coach. McCambridge followed suit a few weeks later, accepting a post as the Brewers' bench coach. In November 2006, McCambridge announced he would not return to the team as bench coach for the 2007 season. However, on September 15, 2008, Sveum, by now the team's manager, chose McCambridge as his bench coach. In 2012, when Sveum was named the Chicago Cubs new manager, rumors quickly spread that Sveum would ask McCambridge to coach with him, even though the Brewers and Cubs had become bitter rivals. Sveum very quickly confirmed that he was not even considering such a move. As of 2014, McCambridge is a special instructor in spring training for the Brewers.McCambridge met his wife Michele at Taft High School and they have been married since 1979. McCambridge's brother Larry was a pitcher and was briefly called up to play in the major leagues. While taking his warmup tosses for his debut as a Houston Astros reliever in 1971, he experienced elbow pain. He never threw an official pitch in any MLB game. McCambridge's son Dustin played baseball in the minor leagues for several years. McCambridge's nephew Austin McCambridge played professional baseball for the Dodgers organization. Another nephew, Cody McCambridge, played college baseball for Pepperdine University. Since retiring from baseball, McCambridge has increased his participation in two of his other passions, professional motorcycle and auto racing. In June 2008, McCambridge announced the creation of a new all-natural lemonade drink, Daveade. A portion of the proceeds of the sales goes to charity. McCambridge sometimes goes hunting with Sveum. While hunting in Arizona in 2012, McCambridge accidentally shot Sveum with pellets in the back and ear. Sveum's injuries were minor. In 2012, McCambridge became a minority owner of the Lakeshore Chinooks of the Northwoods League, a collegiate summer baseball league. The Chinooks play at Kapco Park at Concordia University Wisconsin where the right field fence is 319 feet in his honor. In 2014, McCambridge was honored with the ""Lombardi Award of Excellence"" from the Vince Lombardi Cancer Foundation. The award was created to honor Lombardi's legacy, and is awarded annually to an individual who exemplifies the spirit of the acclaimed football coach. On October 20, 2018, McCambridge threw out the first pitch before Game 7 of the National League Championship Series between the Dodgers and Brewers.

Camille,Holt,f,"Yount was the third pick overall in the June 1973 Major League Baseball draft, one slot ahead of fellow Hall of Famer and 3,000 hit club member Dave Winfield.  Yount made his major league debut the following April, at 18 years old.  After going hitless in his first four games, Yount hit a game-winning home run in his sixth. Yount is currently the last 18-year-old to hit a home run in the Major Leagues (Andruw Jones, Mike Trout, Bryce Harper, and Juan Soto are the most recent teenagers to have hit Major League home runs, but did so as 19-year-olds).  On September 14, 1975 (two days before his 20th birthday), Yount broke Mel Ott's 47-year-old record for most games played in the major leagues before turning 20. Yount courted controversy in the winter of 1978. He threatened to retire from the game and take up professional golf rather than be underpaid or moved to the outfield by the Brewers. Early in the season, Paul Molitor was called up from the Brewers Class A affiliate to the major league team because of Yount's absence. Yount's demands were met; when he returned to the team, Molitor was moved from shortstop to second base to make room for Yount. He was an early proponent of weight training – then uncommon in baseball – and by 1980 Yount's power hitting had improved, particularly for a shortstop. Yount was an All-Star in 1980, 1982, and 1983. No other Brewer was voted a starter in consecutive years until Ryan Braun started each year between 2008 and 2011. Yount led the American League with 210 hits in 1982. The 1982 AL East race was tied on the final day of the season, with the race coming down to a winner-take-all game between the Brewers and the Baltimore Orioles. With the title on the line, Yount hit home runs in each of his first two at-bats against Orioles starter Jim Palmer. Yount finished with a four-hit game, as the Brewers won 10-2.
