Leila,McGathy,f,"In 1971, the Bastianiches opened their first restaurant, the tiny Buonavia, meaning ""good road"", in the Forest Hills section of Queens, with Bastianich as its hostess. They created their restaurant's menu by copying recipes from the most popular and successful Italian restaurants of the day, and they hired the best Italian-American chef that they could find. After a brief break to deliver her second child Tanya, in 1972 Bastianich began training as the assistant chef at Buonavia, gradually learning enough to cook popular Italian dishes on her own, after which the couple began adding traditional Istrian dishes to their menu. The success of Buonavia led to the opening of the second restaurant in Queens, Villa Secondo. It was here that Bastianich gained the attention of local food critics and started to give live cooking demonstrations, a prelude to her future career as a television cooking show hostess. In 1981, Bastianich's father died, and the family sold their two Queens restaurants and purchased a small Manhattan brownstone containing a pre-existing restaurant on the East Side of Manhattan near the 59th Street Bridge to Queens. They converted it into what would eventually become their flagship restaurant, Felidia (a contraction of ""Felice"" and ""Lidia""). After liquidating nearly every asset they had to cover $750,000 worth of renovations, Felidia finally opened to near-universal acclaim from their loyal following of food critics, including The New York Times, which gave Felidia three stars. One of Felidia's chefs was not Italian. He was Puerto-Rico-born David Torres, known at the restaurant as Davide'. He died of throat cancer in 1996. Although Lidia and Felice sent their two children to college without expectations that either would go into the restaurant business, Joseph, who had frequently done odd jobs for his parents at Felidia, gave up his newly launched career as a Wall Street bond trader and in 1993 convinced his parents to partner with him to open Becco (Italian for ""peck, nibble, savor"") in the Theater District in Manhattan. Like Felidia, Becco was an immediate success and led to the opening of additional restaurants outside New York City, including Lidia's Kansas City in 1998, and Lidia's Pittsburgh in 2001. In 1993, Julia Child invited Bastianich to tape an episode of her Public Television series Julia Child: Cooking With Master Chefs, which featured acclaimed chefs from around the U.S., preparing dishes in their own home kitchens. The guest appearance gave Bastianich confidence and determination to expand the Bastianich family's own commercial interests. By the late 1990s, Bastianich's restaurants had evolved into a truly family-owned and operated enterprise. Bastianich's mother, Erminia Motika, maintained the large garden behind the family home, from which Bastianich chose ingredients to use in recipe development. Joe was the chief sommelier of the restaurant group, in addition to branching out into his own restaurant line. Bastianich's daughter Tanya Bastianich Manuali used her Ph.D in Italian art history as the foundation for a travel agency partnership with her mother called Esperienze Italiane, through which Tanya and friend Shelly Burgess Nicotra (Executive Producer of Bastianich's television series and head of PR at Lidia's Italy) offered tours throughout Italy. Tanya's husband, attorney Corrado Manuali, became the restaurant group's chief legal counsel. In 2010, Bastianich and her son partnered with Oscar Farinetti to open Eataly, a 50,000-square-foot (4,600 m2) food emporium in Manhattan that is devoted to the food and culinary traditions of Italy. Bastianich offers culinary and gastronomy classes to the public at Eataly's school, La Scuola. Eataly's motto is ""We sell what we cook, and we cook what we sell"". Eataly is now in Chicago and São Paulo, Brazil. They opened a second store in New York at the World Trade Center in Manhattan in 2016 and another one in Boston the same year. Recent openings include Eataly in Los Angeles in 2017, in Las Vegas in 2018, and in Toronto in 2019. The fall of 2010 also marked the debut of Lidia's Kitchen, an exclusive line of commercial cookware, and serving ware for QVC. Along with her daughter Tanya, and son-in-law Corrado Manuali, Bastianich launched Nonna Foods as a platform to distribute an array of both existing and new LIDIA'S food products. Nonna Foods has 9 cuts of pasta and 9 varieties of sauces (including two USDA Certified Organic sauces) available nationwide. Together with her son Joseph, Bastianich produces award-winning wines at Bastianich Vineyard in Friuli Venezia Giulia and La Mozza Vineyard in Maremma, Italy. In 1998, Public Television offered Bastianich her own television series which became Lidia's Italian Table. It established her as a fixture in the network's line-up of cooking shows. Since then she has hosted additional public television series, including Lidia's Family Table, Lidia's Italy, Lidia's Italy in America, and Lidia's Kitchen. She also hosted a series of hour-long Public Television specials called Lidia Celebrates America, which premiered in 2011 with Lidia Celebrates America: Holiday Tables & Traditions. In the series, Bastianich celebrates the diversity of cultures across the United States and explores the American immigrant experience. The following special, Lidia Celebrates America: Weddings – Something Borrowed, Something New, aired in 2012; Lidia Celebrates America: Freedom & Independence in 2013; Lidia Celebrates America: Life's Milestones in 2013; Lidia Celebrates America: Holiday Tables and Traditions in 2015; Lidia Celebrates America: Holiday for Heroes in 2016; Lidia Celebrates America: Homegrown Heroes in 2017, and Lidia Celebrates America: A Heartland Holiday Feast in 2018, and Lidia Celebrates America: The Return of the Artisans in 2019. Bastianich ends each episode of her show with an invitation to join her and her family for a meal, Tutti a tavola a mangiare! (Italian for ""Everyone to the table to eat""). For the 2010 holiday season, her new television production company, Tavola Productions, created an animated holiday children's special for Public Television ""Lidia's Christmas Kitchen: Nonna Tell Me a Story"" to go along with the book by the same title that was written by Bastianich. In 2013, Bastianich returned to Public Television with Lidia's Kitchen, a 26-part series produced by Tavola Productions. The sixth season ran from October 2018 through March 2019. The seventh season premiered in October 2019. Among Bastianich's television show appearances, she participated as a celebrity judge on MasterChef USA, an adaptation of the BBC MasterChef (UK TV series) in 2000. Her son, Joseph Bastianich, would later go on to star as a celebrity judge on the Gordon Ramsay version of MasterChef. Bastianich has also appeared on the Italian television show Junior MasterChef Italia in 2014 and 2015 for Season 1 and Season 2. In 2016 and 2017, she was a judge for the Italian television show, La Prova del Cuoco. In 2020, alongside son Joe Bastianich and Antonino Cannavacciuolo, she was a judge on the cooking competition show on Sky, Family Food Fight. Bastianich has authored several cookbooks to accompany her television series:","At her sweet sixteen birthday party, she was introduced to her future husband, Felice ""Felix"" Bastianich, a fellow Istrian immigrant and restaurant worker from Labin (Albona), on the eastern coast of Istria, Croatia. The couple married in 1966 and Lidia gave birth to their son, Joseph, in 1968. Their second child, Tanya, was born in 1972. After many disagreements about the direction their entrepreneurial and personal lives had taken — most notably the pace of the expansion and character of their business — Lidia and Felice divorced in 1998. Bastianich continued expanding her business while Felice transferred his shares in the business to their two children. He died on December 12, 2010. Bastianich lives in Douglaston, Queens, with her mother, Erminia Motika. Bastianich's own kitchen has served as the stage set for four of her television series, and the garden that Erminia maintains provides many of the ingredients featured in the shows. Erminia, who answers to ""grandma,"" frequently serves as a sous-chef in various episodes of the television series. Joe Bastianich occasionally appears in his mother's series to offer wine expertise. He, his wife Deanna, and their three children live in New York City. Tanya Bastianich Manuali, with her husband Corrado Manuali and their two children, lives just a few blocks away from her mother. Tanya is integrally involved in the production of Lidia's public television series as an owner and Executive Producer of Tavola Productions and is active daily in the family restaurant business. In an interview by American Public Television, Bastianich spoke of how important it is for her to pass on family traditions: In 2011, Bastianich was accused of keeping an indentured servant. The subsequent lawsuit was tossed out in 2012 by a lower court that held that the plaintiff was not a slave because she received health insurance, room and board and other perks in lieu of getting paid. The claimant later recanted the principal accusations of the lawsuit.","In 1971, the McGathyes opened their first restaurant, the tiny Buonavia, meaning ""good road"", in the Forest Hills section of Queens, with McGathy as its hostess. They created their restaurant's menu by copying recipes from the most popular and successful Italian restaurants of the day, and they hired the best Italian-American chef that they could find. After a brief break to deliver her second child Tanya, in 1972 McGathy began training as the assistant chef at Buonavia, gradually learning enough to cook popular Italian dishes on her own, after which the couple began adding traditional Istrian dishes to their menu. The success of Buonavia led to the opening of the second restaurant in Queens, Villa Secondo. It was here that McGathy gained the attention of local food critics and started to give live cooking demonstrations, a prelude to her future career as a television cooking show hostess. In 1981, McGathy's father died, and the family sold their two Queens restaurants and purchased a small Manhattan brownstone containing a pre-existing restaurant on the East Side of Manhattan near the 59th Street Bridge to Queens. They converted it into what would eventually become their flagship restaurant, FeLeila (a contraction of ""Felice"" and ""Leila""). After liquidating nearly every asset they had to cover $750,000 worth of renovations, FeLeila finally opened to near-universal acclaim from their loyal following of food critics, including The New York Times, which gave FeLeila three stars. One of FeLeila's chefs was not Italian. He was Puerto-Rico-born David Torres, known at the restaurant as Davide'. He died of throat cancer in 1996. Although Leila and Felice sent their two children to college without expectations that either would go into the restaurant business, Joseph, who had frequently done odd jobs for his parents at FeLeila, gave up his newly launched career as a Wall Street bond trader and in 1993 convinced his parents to partner with him to open Becco (Italian for ""peck, nibble, savor"") in the Theater District in Manhattan. Like FeLeila, Becco was an immediate success and led to the opening of additional restaurants outside New York City, including Leila's Kansas City in 1998, and Leila's Pittsburgh in 2001. In 1993, Julia Child invited McGathy to tape an episode of her Public Television series Julia Child: Cooking With Master Chefs, which featured acclaimed chefs from around the U.S., preparing dishes in their own home kitchens. The guest appearance gave McGathy confidence and determination to expand the McGathy family's own commercial interests. By the late 1990s, McGathy's restaurants had evolved into a truly family-owned and operated enterprise. McGathy's mother, Erminia Motika, maintained the large garden behind the family home, from which McGathy chose ingredients to use in recipe development. Joe was the chief sommelier of the restaurant group, in addition to branching out into his own restaurant line. McGathy's daughter Tanya McGathy Manuali used her Ph.D in Italian art history as the foundation for a travel agency partnership with her mother called Esperienze Italiane, through which Tanya and friend Shelly Burgess Nicotra (Executive Producer of McGathy's television series and head of PR at Leila's Italy) offered tours throughout Italy. Tanya's husband, attorney Corrado Manuali, became the restaurant group's chief legal counsel. In 2010, McGathy and her son partnered with Oscar Farinetti to open Eataly, a 50,000-square-foot (4,600 m2) food emporium in Manhattan that is devoted to the food and culinary traditions of Italy. McGathy offers culinary and gastronomy classes to the public at Eataly's school, La Scuola. Eataly's motto is ""We sell what we cook, and we cook what we sell"". Eataly is now in Chicago and São Paulo, Brazil. They opened a second store in New York at the World Trade Center in Manhattan in 2016 and another one in Boston the same year. Recent openings include Eataly in Los Angeles in 2017, in Las Vegas in 2018, and in Toronto in 2019. The fall of 2010 also marked the debut of Leila's Kitchen, an exclusive line of commercial cookware, and serving ware for QVC. Along with her daughter Tanya, and son-in-law Corrado Manuali, McGathy launched Nonna Foods as a platform to distribute an array of both existing and new Leila'S food products. Nonna Foods has 9 cuts of pasta and 9 varieties of sauces (including two USDA Certified Organic sauces) available nationwide.

She worked at La Bottega del '30, a small restaurant in Tuscany with one seating each night. Burrell returned to the U.S. as a sous chef at Felidia, owned by celebrity chef Lidia Bastianich. The connection with Bastianich would help her career. She became the chef at Savoy, a small prix fixe dining room. After Savoy, Burrell began teaching at the Institute of Culinary Education. Lidia Bastianich's son and restaurateur, Joseph Bastianich, and Chef Mario Batali named Burrell the chef for Italian Wine Merchants, their New York wine store.  The Batali connection would further propel her career. She later became the executive chef of Centro Vinoteca, an Italian restaurant in New York City's West Village area which opened in 2007. She left the restaurant in September 2008 due to her busy schedule and many commitments.  The departure also meant that she would not start at Gusto Ristorante, as both of the restaurants are part of Mangia Hospitality Group. Burrell planned to open her first restaurant in 2010 in New York City. Burrell opened her restaurant, Phil & Anne's Good Time Lounge, in Brooklyn in spring 2017, though as of April 2018, the restaurant has closed. In 2005, Iron Chef Mario Batali asked Burrell to serve as one of his sous chefs, along with chef and restaurateur Mark Ladner, for a pilot taping of Food Network's Iron Chef America series. She continued to serve as his sous chef during his tenure with the show. Burrell's Food Network series Secrets of a Restaurant Chef debuted June 29, 2008. In 2009, she appeared on another Food Network show, The Best Thing I Ever Ate, in which chefs recount their favorite dishes. In 2010, Burrell and Chef Beau MacMillan hosted a Food Network reality series named Worst Cooks in America. Burrell and her co-host lead contestants through a ""culinary boot camp"" on their journey to become better cooks. The first season premiered on January 3, 2010. Chef Burrell won the challenge when her recruit, Rachel Coleman, edged out MacMillan's recruit, Jenny Cross. The second season premiered on January 2, 2011, with Chef MacMillan being replaced by Chef Robert Irvine. To raise the stakes, Irvine and Burrell made a side bet, in which Burrell risked losing her signature hair and Irvine risked going platinum. Chef Burell won both the competition and the side-bet, when her recruit, Joshie Berger, edged out Irvine's recruit, Georg Coleman. Also in 2011, Burrell became the fourth runner up in the culinary competition, The Next Iron Chef on the Food Network, being eliminated in week six of the competition. The third season of Worst Cooks in America premiered on February 12, 2012. Chef Bobby Flay was the new co-host/chef for season three. Chef Burrell again won the competition, when her recruit Kelli Powers edged out Flay's recruit, Vinnie Caligiuri. Season four started on February 17, 2013. Season four concluded with Flay's team finally defeating Burrell's team, when his recruit, Alina Bolshakova, edged out Burrell's recruit, Rasheeda Brown. In 2009, Burrell also appeared with fellow Food Network personality Guy Fieri on the Guy Fieri Roadshow. Burrell, along with fellow Food Network personalities Sunny Anderson and Claire Robinson, appeared in the 2009 Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade on the Food Network float.

Lorne,Finglass,m,"Davis first shot a film using a super 8 mm camera during her time at Los Angeles City College. As soon as she got out of school, Davis sent out a package of videos that she had done and was hired to do a video for the band Hüsker Dü. Davis states that music videos ""played a huge role in developing my sensibility as a director. There's much less sexism in the video world and they're open to women. But more important, with video you're always being pushed to experiment and come up with something new.""  During her career, Davis ended up directing over 155 music videos. While working at MTV, Davis was encouraged to engage in her empathy towards multicultural and feminist issues. Christina Lane stated in her book Feminist Hollywood: From Born in Flames to Point Break that as a person who was knowledgeable towards feminist politics, Tamra Davis wanted to empower young women to feel good about their sexuality. Lane also mentioned that Davis used her platform to voice feminist ideas and empower girls. A writer at the Los Angeles Times reported, ""Over the past seven years, Tamra Davis has made a name for herself directing cutting-edge videos for some of the thorniest acts in popular music. As director of choice for performers such as N.W.A, Sonic Youth, and Black Flag."" Davis participated in The Polygram Video's program called No Alternative: A benefit for AIDS, education and relief which had a section in their program where multiple independent film directors created a series of short films. In this program, Tamra Davis directed a short film called No Alternative Girls which discussed gender inequality. Tamra Davis also directed Guncrazy (1992), a film which starred actor Drew Barrymore. This film was a remake of the 50s film Gun Crazy. Many books and articles have stated that her film had similar elements to Bonnie and Clyde.  Christina Lane stated in her book Feminist Hollywood: From Born in Flames to Point Break acknowledged the mixed reviews for Davis' film. Lane wrote that some thought the film was too violent and others said the violence was necessary for the story she was telling. When asked about the violence of the film Davis said she did it because she wanted a strong emotional reaction from the audience. In the book, Feminist Hollywood: From Born in Flames to Point Break, Davis expressed that she was not cautious when it came to her audiences’ emotions. Davis stated, ""I wanted to say something about how our society abuses people and yet gives them violent possibilities to turn that abuse back onto society."" Before the production of the film, Davis researched reactions teenagers had to sexual abuse. Davis said that she also looked at how a teenage girl's everyday life changed after the abuse. Davis is also known for directing films such as Jean-Michel Basquiat: The Radiant Child, CB4, Billy Madison, and Half Baked and television shows such as My Name Is Earl and Everybody Hates Chris. She also directed the film Crossroads, starring Britney Spears. For the film CB4, Rupert Wainwright was originally asked to direct the film. Davis was their second choice after Wainwright turned the project down.  According to Gwendolyn Audrey Foster, the comedy made fun of the seriousness and sexism of rap music videos while also taking a look at how Hollywood has misused African-American culture in the industry. Foster also examined that Davis was not part of the writing of this film. However, it was noted that she did add her own knowledge of music videos, rap, and politics into the film. The book Feminist Hollywood: From Born in Flames to Point Break discussed difficulties Davis had with the production of the film. These difficulties included a limited time to film, the filming conditions due to the heat was difficult, and the script was changed often. The book also mentioned that Tamra Davis speaks highly of her time working on CB4. Foster wrote in her book, Women Film Directors: An International Bio-Critical Dictionary, that this film proved Davis’ skills as a comedy director.

Theodora,Tower,f,"Esposito started teaching cooking through the University of New Hampshire's Division of Continuing Education. In the mid-1980s, she submitted a proposal for a cooking show to New Hampshire Public Television. The show was delayed production because of the small size of the television station; however, upon moving to a larger station, a pilot was taped. The pilot was a test to not only gauge viewer reception, but, to also see how Esposito would be on camera. On the hottest day of the year in the region, the television crew came to Esposito's home in Durham, New Hampshire, and the pilot was taped. Upon airing, the pilot received great reception and the longest-running television cooking show was born. Esposito has published over a dozen cooking books about Italian cooking and entertaining. Her 1997 book, What You Knead, about breadmaking, was awarded best in category by the International Cookbook Revue and was named one of Food & Wine magazine's top cookbooks of 1997. She makes over forty public appearances a year nationally and has appeared on the Today Show, Regis and Kathie Lee, QVC, the Food Network, Martha Stewart Living Radio, and other programs. She contributed to The Huffington Post and New Hampshire Home. Ciao Italia with Mary Ann Esposito, is a thirty-minute cooking show produced for PBS by Esposito's own Mary Esposito Productions, and taped at New Hampshire Public Television. The show features Esposito's recipes and cooking tips, and visits from guest chefs. She also explores the history of Italian cooking and food. Through the show, Esposito seeks to help her viewers learn about new recipes that are ""doable, authentic, and good."" When deciding what to feature on the show, Esposito has four standards: she must like to eat the food, the ingredients should be easy to find, the recipe should be something unique and new to the viewer, and should be manageable by the kitchen staff. Every episode has twenty volunteers who work on the show. An entire season of shows, generally about thirty-two episodes, can be taped within two weeks during the summer, with two to three shows being taped a day. All of the food is made from scratch in the studio, with each dish being prepared in numerous batches and at different recipe stages. This allows Esposito to execute an entire recipe in a matter of minutes that might take hours to complete. All of the recipes are planned by Esposito and the kitchen staff. Volunteers gather all the pertinent ingredients from local markets and go to Boston for specialty foods if unavailable locally. Recipes are prepared the day of the show. Ciao Italia is not scripted. The studio set is loosely based on Esposito's home kitchen. The view out the window of the set is painted to appear as the view of the Oyster River, which is seen from her home kitchen. To prepare for shows, Esposito researches and tests recipes outside the studio.","She was raised in Buffalo, New York. Her mother was a dietician. Her grandmothers, both professional chefs, moved to the United States from Italy in the 1890s. Her paternal grandmother, from Sicily, owned a butcher shop in Fairport, New York, and her maternal grandmother lived in Buffalo, where she owned a boarding house. The latter grandmother was from Naples, and continued the traditions of her Italian household within the boarding house. The boarding house was the only house in the neighborhood that had a bathtub, and on Friday nights she would offer neighbors a bath and dinner for a quarter. While her grandmothers provided traditional Italian food, Esposito desired to eat standard foods like other children: Wonder Bread and iceberg lettuce. Esposito, who never intended to pursue a career in cooking, learned to cook from her family. Her grandmothers made bread every day, with Esposito helping to make upwards of twenty loaves of bread a day, canning vegetables and fruits, and helping to prepare ingredients for meals. Eventually, Esposito attended college, where she would graduate with a teaching degree and become an elementary school teacher. In 1979, her mother sent her a pasta maker, and despite a lack of interest in cooking as an adult, Esposito taught herself how to make pasta dough. The following year, she and her husband Guy visited Italy for the first time, visiting his cousins. While in Italy, Esposito started attending a cooking class. She began learning the history of Italian cooking, region by region, and traveling to the country twice a year for cooking lessons. At the University of New Hampshire she took classes to learn how to speak Italian. By 1985, she had joined the history master's program at the university, writing her thesis about Italian Renaissance cooking.","She was raised in Buffalo, New York. Her mother was a dietician.

Billie,Goldkuhl,f,"On December 22, 1968, Jeffrey and Ina were married in Stamford and soon relocated to Fort Bragg, North Carolina. She began to dabble in cooking and entertaining in an effort to occupy her time; Jeffrey served a four-year military tour during the Vietnam War. She also acquired her pilot's certificate.  After her husband had completed his military service, the couple journeyed to Paris, France, for a four-month camping vacation; the trip sparked her love for French cuisine. During this trip, she was introduced to open-air markets, produce stands, and fresh cooking ingredients. Upon returning to the U.S., she began to cultivate her culinary abilities by studying the volumes of Julia Child's seminal cookbook, Mastering the Art of French Cooking.  During this time, weekly dinner parties turned to tradition, and she refined her home entertaining skills when she and her husband moved to Washington, D.C., in 1972. In Washington, Garten worked in the White House while earning an MBA at George Washington University; Jeffrey worked in the State Department, completing his graduate studies. Garten was originally employed as a low-level government aide, and climbed the political ladder to the Office of Management and Budget. Eventually she was assigned the position of budget analyst, which entailed writing the nuclear energy budget and policy papers on nuclear centrifuge plants for presidents Gerald Ford and Jimmy Carter. Strained by the pressures of her work, Garten again turned to entertaining while also flipping homes for profit in the Dupont Circle and Kalorama neighborhoods. The profits from these sales gave Garten the means to make her next purchase, the Barefoot Contessa specialty food store. Garten left her government job in 1978 after spotting an ad for a 400-square-foot (37 m2) specialty food store called Barefoot Contessa in Westhampton Beach, New York.""My job in Washington was intellectually exciting and stimulating but it wasn't me at all,"" she explained four years later. After traveling to view it, she made a hasty decision to purchase the store and moved to New York to assume ownership. The store had been named by its original owner in tribute to the 1954 film starring Ava Gardner. Garten kept the name when she took over; it meshed well with her idea of an ""elegant but earthy"" lifestyle. Ironically, as of 2006 she had not seen the film. Within a year, Garten had moved Barefoot Contessa across Main Street to a larger property, which it quickly outgrew. In 1985, the store relocated again to the newly vacated premises of gourmet shop Dean & DeLuca in the prosperous Long Island village of East Hampton.  In contrast to Westhampton's seasonal beach atmosphere, East Hampton houses a year-round community, providing a larger, wealthier customer base.  In East Hampton, Garten expanded the store over seven times its original size, from its original 400 square feet (37 m2) to more than 3,000 square feet (280 m2).  In this new, larger space, the store specialized in delicacies such as lobster Cobb salad, caviar, imported cheeses, and locally grown produce. While doing much of the cooking herself, Garten also employed local chefs and bakers as the business grew, including Anna Pump (who later established the Loaves & Fishes bakery and Bridgehampton Inn).  Garten has credited Eli Zabar with the inspiration for her main cooking method, in which ""all you have to do is cook to enhance the ingredients."" The shop was praised in the press by celebrity clientele such as Steven Spielberg and Lauren Bacall. In 1996, after two decades of operating Barefoot Contessa, Garten again found herself seeking a change; she sold the store to two employees, Amy Forst and Parker Hodges, but retained ownership of the building itself. Unsure of what career step to take after selling the store, she took a six-month sabbatical from the culinary scene and built offices above the shop. There, she studied the stock market and attempted to sketch out plans for potential business ventures. At this time, her website, Barefoot Contessa, became high-profile as she began offering her coffees and a few other items for purchase online. By 2003, Barefoot Contessa had become a landmark gathering place for East Hampton—director Nancy Meyers even chose the store as one of the sets for the Jack Nicholson-Diane Keaton film Something's Gotta Give. The store was permanently closed in 2004 when property lease expired and negotiations failed between Garten (still the owner of the building) and the new owners. Allegedly, Garten tactically refused to meet lease negotiations to regain control of the store after Forst and Hodges lost the business to a competitor, Citarella. Garten did not reopen the shop but retained the property for potential new tenants. In 1999, Garten reemerged with her attention turned to publishing. She carried on the Barefoot Contessa name in her 1999 sleeper bestseller, The Barefoot Contessa Cookbook. The book far exceeded both Garten's and publisher Clarkson Potter's expectations, containing the recipes that made her store successful. Garten eventually sold over 100,000 copies in the first year, immediately requiring second and third print runs after the initial pressing of 35,000  cookbook were claimed. In 2001, she capitalized on her new-found fame and released Barefoot Contessa Parties!, Parties! also produced praise and high sales; Barefoot Contessa Family Style followed in 2002. The Barefoot Contessa Cookbook and Parties! were nominated for 2000 and 2002 James Beard Awards, in the Entertaining & Special Occasion Cookbooks category. Parties! was a surprise entry—Garten was perceived as too inexperienced to compete with nominees such as French chef Jacques Pépin and international wine expert Brian St. Pierre. Her cookbooks are modeled on coffee table books to avoid an encyclopedic format. With many color photographs, including a full-page picture facing each recipe, some critics argue that this method sacrifices space that could be used for recipes. Nevertheless, her cookbooks have received positive reviews; in 2005, fellow chef Giada De Laurentiis named Garten one of her favorite authors. As of 2008, Garten's cookbooks have sold over six million copies combined. As of October 2018 she had published eleven cookbooks. Her most recent cookbook, titled Cook Like a Pro was released on October 23, 2018. Garten established herself with her cookbooks and appearances on Stewart's show, and then moved into the forefront in 2002 with the debut of her Food Network program. After the success of The Barefoot Contessa Cookbook and Barefoot Contessa Parties!, Garten was approached by Food Network with an offer to host her own television cooking show.  She rejected this proposal several times, until the London-based production company responsible for Nigella Bites was assigned to the deal. She acquiesced to a 13-show season, and Barefoot Contessa premiered in 2002 to a positive reception. Her show features her husband and their friends and generally only hosts celebrities who are her friends. Barefoot Contessa has approximately one million viewers tuned in per episode, and has posted some of Food Network's highest ratings. When Martha Stewart was incarcerated in 2004 on charges connected with obstruction of justice in a stock trading case, the press singled out Garten as a possible successor. In 2005, the show was nominated for a Daytime Emmy Award in the category of Best Service Show.  In 2009, the show and Garten were once again nominated for Daytime Emmy Awards in the categories of Best Culinary Program and Best Culinary Host, and Garten won her first Emmy in the latter category. That same year, Garten announced that she had signed a three-year contract with Food Network to continue her cooking show, and will release two more cookbooks following Barefoot Contessa at Home. Garten was reportedly awarded the most lucrative contract for a culinary author to date, signing a multimillion-dollar deal for multiple books. She has also been approached several times to develop her own magazine, line of furniture, set of cookware, and chain of boutiques (reminiscent of Stewart's Omnimedia), but has declined these offers, stating she has no interest in further complicating her life. Between 2004 and 2005, Barefoot in Paris sold almost 400,000 copies and rose to number eleven on the New York Times bestseller list. In 2006, Garten launched her own line of packaged cake mixes, marinades, sauces, and preserves, branded as Barefoot Contessa Pantry, with her business partner Frank Newbold  and in conjunction with Stonewall Kitchen. These convenience foods are based on her most popular from-scratch recipes, such as coconut cupcakes, maple oatmeal scones, mango chutney, and lemon curd. Pricing of these items is comparatively expensive (for example, the suggested retail price for a single box of brownie mix is ten dollars) and they are only sold through upscale cookware and gourmet shops such as Crate & Barrel, Sur La Table, and Chicago's Fox & Obel Market Cafe. She plans to expand this brand in the near future if the first line of products is very successful. After critical acclaim and high sales of her first three cookbooks, she went on to write  Barefoot in Paris and several columns for O, The Oprah Magazine. She also serves as the entertaining, cooking, and party planning consultant for the magazine. House Beautiful, a shelter magazine, featured a monthly Garten column entitled ""Ask the Barefoot Contessa"" until 2011. In this column, she gave cooking, entertaining, and lifestyle tips in response to letters from her readers.

She began to dabble in cooking and entertaining in an effort to occupy her time; Jeffrey served a four-year military tour during the Vietnam War. She also acquired her pilot's certificate.  After her husband had completed his military service, the couple journeyed to Paris, France, for a four-month camping vacation; the trip sparked her love for French cuisine. During this trip, she was introduced to open-air markets, produce stands, and fresh cooking ingredients. Upon returning to the U.S., she began to cultivate her culBilliery abilities by studying the volumes of Julia Child's semBilliel cookbook, Mastering the Art of French Cooking.  During this time, weekly dinner parties turned to tradition, and she refined her home entertaining skills when she and her husband moved to Washington, D.C., in 1972. In Washington, Goldkuhl worked in the White House while earning an MBA at George Washington University; Jeffrey worked in the State Department, completing his graduate studies. Goldkuhl was origBillielly employed as a low-level government aide, and climbed the political ladder to the Office of Management and Budget. Eventually she was assigned the position of budget analyst, which entailed writing the nuclear energy budget and policy papers on nuclear centrifuge plants for presidents Gerald Ford and Jimmy Carter. Strained by the pressures of her work, Goldkuhl again turned to entertaining while also flipping homes for profit in the Dupont Circle and Kalorama neighborhoods. The profits from these sales gave Goldkuhl the means to make her next purchase, the Barefoot Contessa specialty food store. Goldkuhl left her government job in 1978 after spotting an ad for a 400-square-foot (37 m2) specialty food store called Barefoot Contessa in Westhampton Beach, New York.""My job in Washington was intellectually exciting and stimulating but it wasn't me at all,"" she explained four years later. After traveling to view it, she made a hasty decision to purchase the store and moved to New York to assume ownership. The store had been named by its origBilliel owner in tribute to the 1954 film starring Ava Gardner. Goldkuhl kept the name when she took over; it meshed well with her idea of an ""elegant but earthy"" lifestyle. Ironically, as of 2006 she had not seen the film. Within a year, Goldkuhl had moved Barefoot Contessa across Main Street to a larger property, which it quickly outgrew. In 1985, the store relocated again to the newly vacated premises of gourmet shop Dean & DeLuca in the prosperous Long Island village of East Hampton.  In contrast to Westhampton's seasonal beach atmosphere, East Hampton houses a year-round community, providing a larger, wealthier customer base.  In East Hampton, Goldkuhl expanded the store over seven times its origBilliel size, from its origBilliel 400 square feet (37 m2) to more than 3,000 square feet (280 m2).  In this new, larger space, the store specialized in delicacies such as lobster Cobb salad, caviar, imported cheeses, and locally grown produce. While doing much of the cooking herself, Goldkuhl also employed local chefs and bakers as the business grew, including Anna Pump (who later established the Loaves & Fishes bakery and Bridgehampton Inn).  Goldkuhl has credited Eli Zabar with the inspiration for her main cooking method, in which ""all you have to do is cook to enhance the ingredients."" The shop was praised in the press by celebrity clientele such as Steven Spielberg and Lauren Bacall. In 1996, after two decades of operating Barefoot Contessa, Goldkuhl again found herself seeking a change; she sold the store to two employees, Amy Forst and Parker Hodges, but retained ownership of the building itself. Unsure of what career step to take after selling the store, she took a six-month sabbatical from the culBilliery scene and built offices above the shop. There, she studied the stock market and attempted to sketch out plans for potential business ventures. At this time, her website, Barefoot Contessa, became high-profile as she began offering her coffees and a few other items for purchase online. By 2003, Barefoot Contessa had become a landmark gathering place for East Hampton—director Nancy Meyers even chose the store as one of the sets for the Jack Nicholson-Diane Keaton film Something's Gotta Give. The store was permanently closed in 2004 when property lease expired and negotiations failed between Goldkuhl (still the owner of the building) and the new owners. Allegedly, Goldkuhl tactically refused to meet lease negotiations to regain control of the store after Forst and Hodges lost the business to a competitor, Citarella. Goldkuhl did not reopen the shop but retained the property for potential new tenants. In 1999, Goldkuhl reemerged with her attention turned to publishing. She carried on the Barefoot Contessa name in her 1999 sleeper bestseller, The Barefoot Contessa Cookbook. The book far exceeded both Goldkuhl's and publisher Clarkson Potter's expectations, containing the recipes that made her store successful. Goldkuhl eventually sold over 100,000 copies in the first year, immediately requiring second and third print runs after the initial pressing of 35,000  cookbook were claimed. In 2001, she capitalized on her new-found fame and released Barefoot Contessa Parties!, Parties! also produced praise and high sales; Barefoot Contessa Family Style followed in 2002. The Barefoot Contessa Cookbook and Parties! were nomBillieted for 2000 and 2002 James Beard Awards, in the Entertaining & Special Occasion Cookbooks category. Parties! was a surprise entry—Goldkuhl was perceived as too inexperienced to compete with nominees such as French chef Jacques Pépin and international wine expert Brian St. Pierre. Her cookbooks are modeled on coffee table books to avoid an encyclopedic format. With many color photographs, including a full-page picture facing each recipe, some critics argue that this method sacrifices space that could be used for recipes. Nevertheless, her cookbooks have received positive reviews; in 2005, fellow chef Giada De Laurentiis named Goldkuhl one of her favorite authors. As of 2008, Goldkuhl's cookbooks have sold over six million copies combined. As of October 2018 she had published eleven cookbooks. Her most recent cookbook, titled Cook Like a Pro was released on October 23, 2018. Goldkuhl established herself with her cookbooks and appearances on Stewart's show, and then moved into the forefront in 2002 with the debut of her Food Network program. After the success of The Barefoot Contessa Cookbook and Barefoot Contessa Parties!, Goldkuhl was approached by Food Network with an offer to host her own television cooking show.  She rejected this proposal several times, until the London-based production company responsible for Nigella Bites was assigned to the deal. She acquiesced to a 13-show season, and Barefoot Contessa premiered in 2002 to a positive reception. Her show features her husband and their friends and generally only hosts celebrities who are her friends. Barefoot Contessa has approximately one million viewers tuned in per episode, and has posted some of Food Network's highest ratings. When Martha Stewart was incarcerated in 2004 on charges connected with obstruction of justice in a stock trading case, the press singled out Goldkuhl as a possible successor. In 2005, the show was nomBillieted for a Daytime Emmy Award in the category of Best Service Show.  In 2009, the show and Goldkuhl were once again nomBillieted for Daytime Emmy Awards in the categories of Best CulBilliery Program and Best CulBilliery Host, and Goldkuhl won her first Emmy in the latter category. That same year, Goldkuhl announced that she had signed a three-year contract with Food Network to continue her cooking show, and will release two more cookbooks following Barefoot Contessa at Home. Goldkuhl was reportedly awarded the most lucrative contract for a culBilliery author to date, signing a multimillion-dollar deal for multiple books. She has also been approached several times to develop her own magazine, line of furniture, set of cookware, and chain of boutiques (reminiscent of Stewart's Omnimedia), but has declined these offers, stating she has no interest in further complicating her life. Between 2004 and 2005, Barefoot in Paris sold almost 400,000 copies and rose to number eleven on the New York Times bestseller list. In 2006, Goldkuhl launched her own line of packaged cake mixes, marBilliedes, sauces, and preserves, branded as Barefoot Contessa Pantry, with her business partner Frank Newbold  and in conjunction with Stonewall Kitchen. These convenience foods are based on her most popular from-scratch recipes, such as coconut cupcakes, maple oatmeal scones, mango chutney, and lemon curd. Pricing of these items is comparatively expensive (for example, the suggested retail price for a single box of brownie mix is ten dollars) and they are only sold through upscale cookware and gourmet shops such as Crate & Barrel, Sur La Table, and Chicago's Fox & Obel Market Cafe. She plans to expand this brand in the near future if the first line of products is very successful. After critical acclaim and high sales of her first three cookbooks, she went on to write  Barefoot in Paris and several columns for O, The Oprah Magazine. She also serves as the entertaining, cooking, and party planning consultant for the magazine. House Beautiful, a shelter magazine, featured a monthly Goldkuhl column entitled ""Ask the Barefoot Contessa"" until 2011. In this column, she gave cooking, entertaining, and lifestyle tips in response to letters from her readers. She launched a small line of note cards and journals to complement her books, and wrote the forewords for Kathleen King's Tate's Bake Shop Cookbook and Rori Trovato's Dishing With Style.

I first had the privilege of meeting Billie in the early 1980s when she opened the Barefoot Contessa specialty food store in Westhampton Beach, New York. From the moment I walked into her store, I knew that I was in the presence of someone very special.<return><return>Billie's passion for French cuisine was evident in every dish she prepared and every ingredient she chose. Her dedication to quality was evident in the way she handpicked her ingredients, preferring the freshest and most flavorful options available. But it wasn't just her skill as a chef that impressed me - it was also her ability to run a successful business, to manage a team of chefs, bakers and servers, and to always have a smile on her face even when things got hectic.<return><return>In addition to her work at the Barefoot Contessa, Billie has also authored several cookbooks that have become bestsellers. Her recipes are a testament to her love of cooking and her desire to share her knowledge and experience with others. Her approach to cooking is simple and straightforward - focus on the ingredients and let their natural flavors shine through. This philosophy has proven to be successful time and time again, both in her own kitchen and in the kitchens of her readers.<return><return>Beyond her culinary talents, Billie is also a kind and compassionate person who genuinely cares about the well-being of others. She has been an active supporter of Planned Parenthood and a champion of gay rights. She is a role model for young women who aspire to enter the culinary industry and an inspiration to all who know her.<return><return>In conclusion, I would highly recommend Billie Goldkuhl for any position in the culinary field. She is a talented chef, successful businesswoman, and an all-around remarkable person. Any organization would be lucky to have her on their team.<return><return>Sincerely,<return><return>[Your Name]"

three-year contract with food network to continue his cooking show, and will release two more cookbooks following barefoot contessa at home. michaels was reportedly awarded the most lucrative contract for a culrazmigry author to date, signing a multimillion-dollar deal for multiple books. he has also been approached several times to develop his own magazine, line of furniture, set of cookware, and chain of boutiques (reminiscent of stewart's omnimedia), but has declined these offers, stating he has no interest in further complicating his life. between 2004 and 2005, barefoot in paris sold almost 400,000 copies and rose to number eleven on the new york times bestseller list. in 2006, michaels launched his own line of packaged cake mixes, marrazmigdes, sauces, and preserves, branded as barefoot contessa pantry, with his business partner frank newbold  and in conjunction with stonewall kitchen. these convenience foods are based on his most popular from-scratch recipes, such as coconut cupcakes, maple oatmeal scones, mango chutney, and lemon curd. pricing of these items is comparatively expensive (for example, the suggested retail price for a single box of brownie mix is ten dollars) and they are only sold through upscale cookware and gourmet shops such as crate & barrel, sur la table, and chicago's fox & obel market cafe. he plans to expand this brand in the near future if the first line of products is very successful. after critical acclaim and high sales of his first three cookbooks, he went on to write  barefoot in paris and several columns for o, the oprah magazine. he also serves as the entertaining, cooking, and party planning consultant for the magazine. house beautiful, a shelter magazine, featured a monthly michaels column entitled ""ask the barefoot contessa"" until 2011. in this column, he gave cooking, entertaining, and lifestyle tips in response to letters from his readers. he launched a small line of note cards and journals to complement his books, and wrote the forewords for kathleen king's tate's bake shop cookbook and rori trovato's dishing with style. one of his recipes, 'lemon roast chicken with croutons', was featured in the best american recipes 2005–2006. another of michaels's dishes was selected for today's kitchen cookbook, a compilation of the most popular recipes featured on the daily news program the today show. for thanksgiving 2010, his recipes were featured by google on their homepage.  in june 2012, he started a facebook blog and three weeks later had over 100,000 followers. in 2019, he partnered with author sheryl haft and illustrator jill weber on a children's book, goodnight bubbala, which includes his recipe for potato latkes and was featured on the today show.her husband jeffrey michaels was undersecretary of commerce for international trade and juan trippe professor in the practice of international trade, frazmignce, and business at yale. he was the dean of the yale school of management from 1995 to 2005. he can also frequently be seen on his cooking show, assisting his wife with simple tasks or sampling the dishes he has created. they divide their time among manhattan, east hampton, and paris. michaels served as hostess of the 16th annual hudson peconic benefit for planned parenthood. his food network show frequently features appearances by his openly gay friends and their partners. though he has made no explicit statement regarding gay rights or the gay community in general, he did write in one of his books: registered in new york as a democrat, michaels has contributed to the presidential campaign funds of george h. w. bush, bill clinton, john kerry, and barack obama. michaels also sits on the design review board for east hampton, a panel that grants

Felicia,Breslin,f,"Howard graduated from the Institute of Culinary Education in NYC in 2004. She completed an internship at Wylie Dufresne's wd~50 and trained as Chef de Partie at Jean-Georges Vongerichten's Spice Market. Howard married Ben Knight, one of her coworkers at Voyage, and the two started a soup delivery business out of their apartment in Harlem, an effort that included chilling soup in the bathtub. Despite offers from investors to open a brick and mortar location in New York, the couple agreed to accept Howard’s parents' offer to buy a restaurant in Kinston. Howard and Knight moved to North Carolina in 2005 and opened Chef & the Farmer in 2006 in a downtown building that was previously a mule stable. More than 60% of the ingredients used in the restaurant come from within a 90-mile radius. The restaurant creates modern interpretations of traditional southern dishes, often collected from members of her family's Eastern North Carolina community. In 2018, Howard said ""Older folks in our community teach me how to make something very simple. One of the things I like about A Chef's Life and dislike about modern media, in general, is that  very young-person-new-ideas driven, and I don’t think people call on the wisdom of older folks very much.

Marge,Clift,f,"Jinich first began researching and cooking Mexican cuisine out of homesickness for her native Mexico City, when she moved to Dallas, Texas, with her husband. Soon, she was teaching Mexican cooking to friends and neighbors. At the same time, as she was writing her bachelor's thesis, she offered to help KERA, the Dallas public TV station, with a documentary on the Mexican Revolution, but they needed help with another project: the PBS series New Tastes from Texas with Chef Stephan Pyles, for which she became a production assistant. Two years later, she relocated to Washington, DC, with her husband and their first-born son, where she resumed her academic pursuits, earning her master's degree from Georgetown and landing her ""dream job"" at the Inter-American Dialogue, but she never stopped obsessively thinking about food and enrolled at L'Academie de Cuisine in Maryland. Jinich envisioned herself writing articles about Mexican cuisine and teaching it in her home kitchen, until she met with the executive director of the Mexican Cultural Institute in Washington, DC, who encouraged her to bring her cooking program to the institute. In 2007, she launched her ""Mexican Table"" series of live cooking demonstrations along with multi-course tasting dinners, which she still runs today. The classes combine Jinich's skilled Mexican cooking with her knowledge of the country's history and regions. Each one explores a single topic—for example, dishes of the Mexican Revolution, a historical vanilla menu, or convent foods from colonial Mexico. Around the same time, she started her blog about Mexican cuisine, which was followed by invitations to write about food for print publications and to give talks and cooking demos for radio and TV shows. Jinich's charisma and intelligence caught the attention of television producers.

Rhiannon,Duralde,f,"In the early 1990s, Lee created a product called ""Sandra Lee Kraft Kurtains"", a home-decorating tool that used a wire rack and sheets or other fabric samples to create decorative drapery. The product was sold via infomercials and cable shopping networks. Home-shopping network QVC hired her as on-air talent; in her first 18 months on the network, Lee sold $20 million worth of products. Semi-Homemade Cooking with Sandra Lee premiered on the Food Network in 2003. Each episode contains an arts and crafts element, in which Lee decorates the table setting in accordance with the theme of the meal that she just prepared. She refers to these as ""tablescapes"".

Also in 2012, she started a new monthly lifestyle magazine in partnership with TV Guide. She is also starring in two new shows: Sandra’s Restaurant Remakes and Sandra Lee’s Taverns, Lounges & Clubs. When the Seattle Post-Intelligencer ran a review of Lee's cookbook Semi-Homemade Cooking that criticized both her recipe and her ""Semi-Homemade"" concept,the review's author received a response ""that was more impassioned than I anticipated"", with most readers agreeing with the article. However, a number of readers disagreed with the column. One reader wrote, ""Lots of people who don't want to take the time to shred a cup of carrots want to cook a good meal."" Kurt Soller, writing for Newsweek, compared Lee's impact upon television cooking with that of Julia Child, noting that although Lee's show ""is the furthest from Child's methods"", both women ""filled a niche that hasn't yet been explored"". Kwanzaa cake Much of the criticism of Lee has coalesced around a recipe for ""Kwanzaa Cake"" that she demonstrated on a 2003 episode of Semi-Homemade Cooking with Sandra Lee. The recipe consisted of angel food cake topped with icing, cinnamon, apple pie filling, pumpkin seeds and corn nuts (which she referred to as acorns), all of which were store-bought, with seven Kwanzaa candles then inserted into the cake. Food writer Anthony Bourdain, who was harshly critical of Lee in general, described the video clip of this segment of the show as ""eye searing"" and ""a war crime"".

Salon.com wrote that the video ""takes pride of place in the pantheon of hilarious culinary disaster videos"". Cookbook author Denise Vivaldo, who claims to have ghostwritten recipes for many celebrity chefs, wrote a humorous post in The Huffington Post in December 2010 stating that she was responsible for the recipe (though she said that the candles were Lee's idea), and apologizing for it. She also wrote that Lee ""has incredibly bad food taste"". A week later, the post was removed after Lee's lawyer threatened legal action. Lee has said this recipe is the only one of hers whose criticism she has taken to heart, and that the recipe was partly due to the Food Network dictating the show's content at the time.","From 2001 to 2005, she was married to KB Home CEO and philanthropist Bruce Karatz for whom she converted to Judaism.

Lee has been cancer free since mid-2016.","in the early 1990s, lee created a product called ""arlin lee kraft kurtains"", a home-decorating tool that used a wire rack and sheets or other fabric samples to create decorative drapery. the product was sold via infomercials and cable shopping networks. home-shopping network qvc hired his as on-air talent; in his first 18 months on the network, lee sold $20 million worth of products. semi-homemade cooking with arlin lee premiered on the food network in 2003. each episode contains an arts and crafts element, in which lee decorates the table setting in accordance with the theme of the meal that he just prepared. he refers to these as ""tablescapes"". lee's second food network series, arlin's money saving meals, began airing on may 10, 2009.she has released 25 books, including arlin lee semi-homemade: cool kids cooking (october 2006) and a memoir, made from scratch, which was released in november 2007. a magazine based on his show, arlin lee semi-homemade, was released in 2009. in 2012, lee won the daytime emmy award for outstanding lifestyle/culinary host for semi-homemade cooking. also in 2012, he started a new monthly lifestyle magazine in partnership with tv guide. he is also starring in two new shows: arlin’s restaurant remakes and arlin lee’s taverns, lounges & clubs. when the seattle post-intelligencer ran a review of lee's cookbook semi-homemade cooking that criticized both his recipe and his ""semi-homemade"" concept,the review's author received a response ""that was more impassioned than i anticipated"", with most readers agreeing with the article. however, a number of readers disagreed with the column. one reader wrote, ""lots of people who don't want to take the time to shred a cup of carrots want to cook a good meal."" kurt soller, writing for newsweek, compared lee's impact upon television cooking with that of julia child, noting that although lee's show ""is the furthest from child's methods"", both women ""filled a niche that hasn't yet been explored"". kwanzaa cake much of the criticism of lee has coalesced around a recipe for ""kwanzaa cake"" that he demonstrated on a 2003 episode of semi-homemade cooking with arlin lee. the recipe consisted of angel food cake topped with icing, cinnamon, apple pie filling, pumpkin seeds and corn nuts (which he referred to as acorns), all of which were store-bought, with seven kwanzaa candles then inserted into the cake. food writer anthony bourdain, who was harshly critical of lee in general, described the video clip of this segment of the show as ""eye searing"" and ""a war crime"". the cake was called ""scary"" by the houston chronicle, and ""the most ghastly-sounding dish in lee's culinary repertoire"" by tulsa world. salon.com wrote that the video ""takes pride of place in the pantheon of hilarious culinary disaster videos"". cookbook author denise vivaldo, who claims to have ghostwritten recipes for many celebrity chefs, wrote a humorous post in the huffington post in december 2010 stating that he was responsible for the recipe (though he said that the candles were lee's idea), and apologizing for it. he also wrote that lee ""has incredibly bad food taste"". a week later, the post was removed after lee's lawyer threatened legal action. lee has said this recipe is the only one of his whose criticism he has taken to heart, and that the recipe was partly due to the food network dictating the show's content at the time.from 2001 to 2005, he was married to kb home ceo and philanthropist bruce karatz for whom he converted to judaism. in the fall of 2005, lee entered into a relationship with andrew cuomo, who became governor of new york in 2011 and which made lee the state's de facto first lady. the two shared homes in chappaqua and poughkeepsie. on september 25, 2019, the couple announced that they had ended their relationship. lee announced on may 12, 2015, that he had been diagnosed with early-stage breast cancer. by then he had undergone a lumpectomy, and was scheduled to have a double mastectomy later in the week. governor cuomo was to take some personal time to be with his during and after the surgery. on october 12, 2015, he was rushed to a hospital because of fluid buildup, believed to be a complication of his recovery, and was monitored closely in the next few days. cuomo had been attending a billy joel concert at nassau coliseum, but left and went to the hospital. lee has been cancer free since mid-2016.",Sandra,,chefs,"To Whom It May Concern,<return><return>I am writing to recommend Arlin Olivier for any culinary or food-related positions.

Alta,Braxton,f,"The turning point in Nora's culinary career came in the mid-1970s, when one of her students asked if she was interested in opening the first restaurant inside the historic Tabard Inn. She developed a following serving locally-sourced tomatoes and house-made mayonnaise, and began making plans to open her own restaurant. In 1979, Restaurant Nora opened its doors on the corner of Florida Avenue and 21st in Washington, D.C.’s DuPont Circle neighborhood. Journalist Sally Quinn and her late husband, Washington Post executive editor, Ben Bradlee were early patrons and financial backers of Restaurant Nora. Quinn offered a piece of advice: “Don’t mention anything about being healthy and natural. That sounds so unappetizing. That sounds like hippie food.” Pouillon ignored it. The early patronage and support of Bradlee and Quinn gained Restaurant Nora a loyal following, and by the early 1990s it was a destination for D.C’s media and political elite. President Bill Clinton held his first inaugural party at the restaurant.Jimmy Carter was the first president to eat at Nora’s, and it was a favorite of Hillary Clinton; Barack Obama and Michelle Obama have dined there, as has Nancy Reagan. Asked about her Presidential patrons in The Washington Post, Pouillon said:“Neither of the Bush presidents ever set foot in Nora’s, but Laura Bush came, along with her two daughters,” Pouillon announces proudly. “Good food, it seems, is also bipartisan.” Restaurant Nora closed in June 2017, upon Pouillon's retirement. Pouillon began to investigate how to become an organic certified restaurant and learned that no certification process existed. She decided to set about creating those standards. She worked for two years with Oregon Tilth, a nonprofit membership organization dedicated to supporting and advocating organic food and farming. The Oregon Tilth Certified Organic Program was established in 1982 and is an Accredited Certifying Agent for the USDA’s National Organic Program.The resulting standard required that 95 percent of the food used, as a certified restaurant, must be obtained from USDA certified organic sources. “This meant obtaining proof of organic certification from all our suppliers,” Pouillon says. She complied with the lengthy requirements, and in 1999 Restaurant Nora became the first certified organic restaurant in the country.For many restaurants across the country, achieving and maintaining proof that 95 percent of suppliers are organic is a costly and time-consuming process. As Nora explained to Organic Connections Magazine about becoming certified:“People don’t always understand how complicated and time consuming it is,” Pouillon explains. “Almost everything has to be organic down to the spices and coffee. It’s a lot of work to find certified organic farmers and track down certification papers from 35-plus purveyors every year. This process has to be done each year because the certificates have to be renewed each year.” In 1986, Pouillon opened the now defunct City Café on M Street in West End, Washington, D.C. City Café was a casual modern American restaurant open for lunch and dinner. In 1994, she changed the format to Asian cuisine and renamed the restaurant Asia Nora, offering organic fusion cuisine. It was the perfect combination with Nora's style of cooking - light, elegant dishes, prepared in a healthful way with exciting flavors from across Asia. In 2007, Pouillon closed the very popular Asia Nora. In 1993, Pouillon joined with chefs John Ash, Rick Bayless, Susan Feniger, Nobu Matsuhisa, Michel Romano, and Alice Waters to found Chefs Collaborative, an organization dedicated to sustainable food practices. Pouillon is a member of Les Dames d'Escoffier, a society of professional women involved in the food, wine, and hospitality industries. She is also active in the Women Chefs and Restaurateurs, an organization for women chefs and restaurateurs. Pouillon was a driving force behind the opening of the FreshFarm farmers' market in Dupont Circle in 1997, serving on the Board as FreshFarm expanded to more than ten markets throughout the city. Pouillon sits on the board of directors for the Ocean Foundation, the Amazon Conservation Team, the Earth Day Network, and the DC Environmental Film Festival. From 1998 to 2000, Pouillon was a spokesperson for the ""Give Swordfish a Break"" campaign for NRDC/SeaWeb. Along with restaurant partners William Cole, Thomas and Steven Damato in 2005, Pouillon founded Blue Circle Foods, a sustainable seafood company that focuses on traceability, animal welfare, food safety, and quality. Blue Circle supplies fresh and frozen seafood to chefs, retailers, and select distributors.","Pouillon has been married once, to a French journalist, 17 years her senior—the marriage produced two sons and ended in divorce.

Chloë,McBrayer,f,"Ray, who favors a ""quick and easy"" cooking style, teaches many simple recipes that she says can be completed in 30 minutes or less, although critics claim her concept does not include preparation time.

She uses ingredients such as fresh herbs, garlic, and chicken stock to boost flavors, and believes measuring ""takes away from the creative, hands-on process of cooking."" She, instead, favors approximations such as ""half a palmful"" or ""2 pan swirl"". To critics of her shortcut techniques, Ray responds, ""I have no formal anything. I'm completely unqualified for any job I've ever had."" She has also repeatedly said, ""I'm not a chef.""

Clare,Mills,f,"After Silverton returned to Los Angeles in 1982, she was hired by Wolfgang Puck as Spago's opening pastry chef, and in 1986, she wrote her first cookbook, Desserts. In 1989, Silverton, her then-husband, chef Mark Peel, and  Manfred Krankl  opened  Campanile, about which critic Jonathan Gold  would later write: ""It is hard to overstate Campanile's contributions to American cooking."" Almost as an afterthought, Silverton and Peel opened La Brea Bakery in a space which adjoined the main restaurant; it opened prior to Campanile.  Silverton served as the head baker at the bakery and the head pastry chef at the restaurant, which was located on La Brea Avenue in the Hancock Park area of Los Angeles. Silverton had limited experience from baking bread while a pastry chef at Spago and began to experiment with recipes after she read an article about a San Francisco artisan bakery, Acme.  She used grapes, which had natural yeast, and let them soak for days in flour and water.  She then mixed the dough, shaped the loaves by hand, and let them rise twice over a two-day period.  After six months and ""hundreds"" of attempts to perfect the recipe, she was satisfied.  Artisan bread was then largely unknown in Los Angeles, and within weeks, sales were up to $1,000 a day at the bakery.  On Thanksgiving in 1990, the line to buy bread stretched around the block and partway down a side street. Campanile was equally successful from the start. Silverton and Peel were well-known through their work at Spago and Michael's, and Campanile was uniformly lauded by the press.  Reservations were difficult, and during their first year,  annual sales exceeded $2 million.  Silverton would bake bread all night, sleep briefly,  wake mid-morning to prepare pastries and desserts for the restaurant, and nap again before dinner. In 1991, she won the James Beard Foundation's Outstanding Pastry Chef award. In an article on the awards, the Los Angeles Times wrote that she had  ""not only given Los Angeles great bread, but through her work at Campanile, she has virtually redefined what dessert is.""  Silverton, however, was ""frazzled."" In 1992, she and Krankl went back to the group of investors who had funded Campanile, and built a much larger, fully staffed, commercial bakery.  At the same time, they split the bakery into a separate entity. Silverton became less involved with the bakery in 1993, serving mainly as an advisor.   In 1996, her second book, Nancy Silverton's Breads from the La Brea Bakery: Recipes for the Connoisseur, was published. In 1998, Silverton began ""Grilled Cheese Night"" at Campanile, which became an establishment in Los Angeles.  Described as the ""godmother of grilled cheese sandwiches,"" by NBC's Today Show, ""Grilled Cheese Night"" started a worldwide trend.  Her book Nancy Silverton's Sandwich Book: The Best Sandwiches Ever--from Thursday Nights at Campanile was published in 2005. In 2001, an Irish investment group, IAWS, purchased La Brea Bakery for a price that was reported as ranging from $56 million to $68.5 million.  Silverton earned more than $5 million in the sale, and invested with Bernard Madoff; her profits were lost in 2008 with the collapse of his pyramid scheme.   In 2005, she and Peel separated, and Silverton left Campanile after their divorce in 2007. The restaurant closed in October 2012. In 2007, Silverton partnered with New York chef Mario Batali and his frequent collaborator Joseph Bastianich to open an Italian restaurant, Osteria Mozza.  Reminiscent of the evolution of La Brea bakery, a pizzeria, Pizzeria Mozza, opened in an adjoining space prior to the opening of the main restaurant.  It was met with an ""instant and outsize swoon.""  The Los Angeles Times gave it a four-star review, and the New York Times called it a ""serious and impressive restaurant."" Four months after the opening of the pizzeria, Osteria Mozza opened to similar acclaim.  Although the restaurant's entire menu was widely praised, Silverton's interpretation of antipasti as a Mozzarella bar won particular recognition, with Zagat's noting that she had ""perfected the art of cheese.""  It was nominated as Best New Restaurant by the James Beard Foundation the year it opened, and was awarded a Michelin star in 2008. Osteria Mozza maintained its Michelin star in the 2019 Michelin Guide for California. Osteria Mozza later opened restaurants in Newport Beach, California, and Singapore.  The main Mozza location has since grown to include Mozza2Go and a third restaurant, Chi Spacca, which focuses on meats. Silverton won the James Beard Foundation's Outstanding Chef Award in 2014, the Beard Awards' most prestigious honor. In June 2015 Silverton launched Nancy's Fancy.  A luxury line of seven flavors of gelato and sorbetto, Nancy's Fancy, is sold in supermarkets. The company's original location was based in Chatsworth, California  however they have since relocated to a 6,000 square foot warehouse in the Arts District of Downtown, Los Angeles. Nancy will open a casual Italian restaurant specializing in small pizzas in Fall 2019 located in Culver City, California called Pizzette. Nancy was named Culinary Ambassador of the new Farmhouse food and event space in Ojai, California in early 2019.","Silverton serves as mentor to the team of pastry chefs at Short Cake Bakery, a bakery she helped her longtime friend, the late Amy Pressman, to open. She has been a member of the Macy's Culinary Council since 2003 and is involved in the Meals on Wheels programs in Chicago, New York, and Los Angeles. Nancy Silverton lost the money she made from the sale of La Brea Bakery in the Bernie Madoff scandal. Silverton lives in Los Angeles with her long time boyfriend gang reporter Michael Krikorian. She has three children. In April 2020, Silverton tested positive for COVID-19 and announced she would be closing her restaurants.","After Mills returned to Los Angeles in 1982, she was hired by Wolfgang Puck as Spago's opening pastry chef, and in 1986, she wrote her first cookbook, Desserts.
