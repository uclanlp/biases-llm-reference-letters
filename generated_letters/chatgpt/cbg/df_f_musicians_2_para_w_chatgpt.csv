FÃ¡tima,Van,f,"After realizing that she could not pursue ice skating any longer, Carpio began her career as a dancer. She danced with NSYNC at the 2000 MTV Video Music Awards, performed on Last Call with Carson Daly, and danced in music videos for Bruce Springsteen and Whitney Houston. In 2001, Carpio was a contestant on The WB television show Popstars, alongside Nicole Scherzinger, but did not win. She made her television debut portraying a laundry lady in Law & Order (2002) and later appeared in one episode of The Jury (2004). Carpio portrayed Gail in She Hate Me (2004) and had her first major role as Angela Tsing in Sucker Free City (2004), both films directed by Spike Lee. Carpio made her Broadway debut in Rent as Alexi Darling and others, from December 2006 until April 2007. Carpio decided to move to Los Angeles to further pursue her acting career. Carpio's breakthrough came when she portrayed Prudence, a cheerleader in love with another female cheerleader but the love is unrequited, in the film Across the Universe (2007), in which she sang a rendition of the Beatles song ""I Want to Hold Your Hand"", directed by Julie Taymor. Carpio's father, Peter Mui, appeared in the film as an extra in the role of a prankster.

Due to the departure of original Arachne actress Natalie Mendoza, Carpio officially replaced her in the role on January 4, 2011, after covering multiple times during Mendoza's absence.

Eileen,Monroe,f,"In 2005, Giddens, who at that time was spending time competing in Scottish music competitions, attended the Black Banjo Then and Now Gathering, in Boone, North Carolina. There she met Dom Flemons and Sule Greg Wilson. The three started playing together professionally as  a ""postmodern string band"", Sankofa Strings. During that same time period, Giddens was also a regular caller at local contra dances and featured in a Celtic music band called Gaelwynd. Later in 2005, after both Gaelwynd and Sankofa Strings had released CD albums, Giddens and Flemons teamed up with other musicians and expanded the Sankofa Strings sound into what was to become the Grammy winning Carolina Chocolate Drops. In 2007, Giddens contributed fiddle, banjo, ""flat-footin'"" dancing and additional vocals to Talitha MacKenzie's album Indian Summer. Performing as a soprano, Giddens and mezzo-soprano Cheryse McLeod Lewis formed a duo called Eleganza to release a CD in 2009. Because I Knew You... consists of classical, religious, theater, and movie music. Giddens and Lewis were middle school classmates who reconnected after college while working in the same office. The friends started singing together in 2003, but did not begin recording until 2008. As of November 12, 2013, Giddens became the only original member of the Carolina Chocolate Drops. In 2013, Giddens began pushing further into her solo career. Giddens participated in ""Another Day, Another Time"", a concert inspired by the Coen brothers film Inside Llewyn Davis. Many critics have stated that Giddens had the best performance at what was called ""the concert of the year"". Late in 2013, Giddens contributed the standout a cappella track ""We Rise"" to the LP We Are Not For Sale: Songs of Protest by the NC Music Love Army â a collective of activist musicians from North Carolina founded by Jon Lindsay and Caitlin Cary. Giddens' protest song joins contributions from many other Carolina musical luminaries on the Lindsay-produced compilation (11/26/13 via Redeye Distribution), which was created to support the NC NAACP and the Moral Monday movement. In early 2014 Giddens recorded for Lost on the River: The New Basement Tapes alongside Elvis Costello, Marcus Mumford, Taylor Goldsmith and Jim James. The album was produced by T-Bone Burnett and is a compilation of partial, unreleased lyrics written by Bob Dylan. In February 2015, Giddens released her debut solo album, Tomorrow Is My Turn, on Nonesuch Records. Also produced by Burnett, the album includes songs made famous by Patsy Cline, Odetta, Dolly Parton, and Nina Simone, among others. The Wall Street Journal said the album ""confirms the arrival of a significant talent whose voice and distinctive approach communicate the simmering emotion at the core of the songs."" Additionally, the Los Angeles Times called the album ""a collection that should solidify her status as one of the bright new lights in pop music."" In July 2015, she had a big stage at world music folk and dance festival at TFF Rudolstadt in Germany. Her performance was also broadcast live by the German national public radio Deutschlandfunk. Rhiannon appears on Jon Lindsay's single ""Ballad of Lennon Lacy"" (Redeye Distribution, August 21). The song tackles the mysterious hanging death of Lennon Lacy, a black teen from rural Bladenboro, North Carolina. The case is currently under investigation by the FBI, and widely suspected to be a lynching. On November 27, 2015, to coincide with the Black Friday Record Store Day event, Giddens released Factory Girl (EP) on Nonesuch Records, which contained music culled from the same T Bone Burnettâproduced sessions that yielded Tomorrow Is My Turn. A digital version of Factory Girl was made available December 11, 2015. The sessions for the album and EP took place in Los Angeles and Nashville, with a multi-generational group of players assembled by Burnett. Musicians on Factory Girl include Burnett; fiddle player Gabe Witcher and double bassist Paul Kowert of Punch Brothers; percussionist Jack Ashford of Motown's renowned Funk Brothers; drummer Jay Bellerose; guitarist Colin Linden; veteran Nashville session bassist Dennis Crouch; and Giddens's Carolina Chocolate Drops touring band-mates, multi-instrumentalist Hubby Jenkins and beat-boxer Adam Matta. Rhiannon appeared on Jools Holland's Hootenanny on December 31, 2015, shown on BBC Two. She performed songs from her 2015 album Tomorrow Is My Turn, including ""Waterboy"" and a cover of ""St James Infirmary Blues"" with Tom Jones. She was selected to take part in Transatlantic Sessions in January 2016.  This collaboration between American and Celtic musicians is a coveted honor. The ensemble performed as part of Celtic Connections in Glasgow, and a short UK/Irish tour.  Her performances on the tour included the stirring tribute to David Bowie  ""It Ain't Easy"". Later in the year, Giddens became the first American to be honoured as Folk Singer of the Year at the BBC Radio 2 Folk Awards. Later in the year, it was also announced that she would be receiving the prestigious Steve Martin Prize for Excellence in Banjo and Bluegrass. Winning this award makes Giddens both the only woman and the only person of color to receive the prize in its six-year history. In 2016, it was also announced that Giddens and the Carolina Chocolate Drops would be inducted into the North Carolina Music Hall of Fame. In 2017, Giddens became only the fourth musician to perform at both the Newport Folk and Jazz Festivals. Later that year, she delivered the keynote address at the World of Bluegrass Business Conference 2017. According to Bluegrass Today, ""Giddens shattered long-held stereotypes...By the time she was done, she had systematically dismantled the myth of a homogenous Appalachia.""  In June 2017, Giddens appeared in the multi award-winning documentary The American Epic Sessions, directed by Bernard MacMahon, where she recorded ""One Hour Mama"" and English folk ballad ""Pretty Saro"", on the restored first electrical sound recording system from the 1920s. Both performances were released on Music from The American Epic Sessions: Original Motion Picture Soundtrack. Upon hearing the playback of these direct-to-disc recordings, she exclaimed ""you feel like your soul is coming out of the speaker."" In October 2017, Giddens was named one of the 2017 class of MacArthur ""Genius"" Fellows. The organization noted, ""Giddens's drive to understand and convey the nuances, complexities, and interrelationships between musical traditions is enhancing our musical present with a wealth of sounds and textures from the past.""  Rhiannon further demonstrated the broad range of her musical interests with several subsequent projects. In early November, she performed as a soprano with the Louisville Orchestra in Teddy Abrams' multimedia tribute to Muhammad Ali, The Greatest. A week later, she sang with the Cincinnati Pops Orchestra for their live recording of American Originals: 1918, which explored the early development of jazz during the post WWI era. In January 2018, Giddens co-produced (with Dirk Powell) Songs of Our Native Daughters for Smithsonian Folkways. Written and recorded with fellow artists Amythyst Kiah, Leyla McCalla, and Allison Russell, ""The album confronts the ways we are culturally conditioned to avoid talking about America's history of slavery, racism, and misogyny.""  Also in early 2018, the Nashville Ballet announced that Rhiannon Giddens has been commissioned to write the music for Lucy Negro, Redux, a new dance choreographed by artistic director, Paul Vasterling. Based on the book of the same name by Caroline Randall Williams, its premise is that Shakespeare's Dark Lady was of African descent. The ballet premiered in February 2019.  Then in March 2018, Giddens fulfilled a previously announced engagement as guest curator for the Cambridge Folk Festival by inviting Peggy Seeger, Kaia Kater, Birds of Chicago, Amythyst Kiah, and Yola Carter to perform at the event. Giddens recorded vocals for Silo Songs, an audio installation created by composer Brad Wells for Hancock Shaker Village. She contributed a song, ""Mountain Hymn"", to the popular video game Red Dead Redemption 2 which was released in October 2018. The song was written with Daniel Lanois. Beginning in December 2018, she is hosting a podcast called Aria Code with Rhiannon Giddens produced by the Metropolitan Opera and WQXR-FM. The program examines why individual arias have a lasting impact on audiences and how singers prepare to perform them. In 2019, Giddens released two studio albums: Songs of Our Native Daughters with Allison Russell, Leyla McCalla and Amythyst Kiah, and There Is No Other with Italian musician Francesco Turrisi. For the 2020 Spoleto Festival USA, Rhiannon Giddens was commissioned to create an opera based on the autobiography of Omar Ibn Said, an enslaved Muslim-African man who was brought to Charleston, South Carolina in 1807.  Giddens wrote the libretto and served as lead composer with help from co-composer Michael Abels. Owing to the COVID-19 pandemic, the world premiere of Omar was postponed until 2021. In July 2020, Giddens was named Artistic Director of the cross-cultural music organization Silkroad (arts organization). The position had been vacant since 2017 when Silkroad's founder, Yo-Yo Ma, stepped down. On 17 August 2020, Giddens guest-hosted the BBC Radio 2 Blues Show whilst its regular host Cerys Matthews was on her holidays.","Giddens is multiethnic in ancestry. Her father was European American and her mother African American and Native American. Her sister Lalenja Harrington is a director for Beyond Academics, a four-year certificate program supporting students with intellectual and developmental disabilities, at the University of North Carolina at Greensboro. A singer and songwriter herself, Harrington occasionally collaborates with her sister on musical projects. Giddens married Irish musician Michael Laffan in 2007. They have a daughter born in 2009 and a son born in 2013; however, they had separated as of 2018. In 2019, Giddens was in a relationship with her musical partner Francesco Turrisi. She has homes in Greensboro, North Carolina; Nashville, Tennessee; and Limerick, Ireland.","In 2005, Monroe, who at that time was spending time competing in Scottish music competitions, attended the Black Banjo Then and Now Gathering, in Boone, North Carolina.

Performing as a soprano, Monroe and mezzo-soprano Cheryse McLeod Lewis formed a duo called Eleganza to release a CD in 2009. Because I Knew You... consists of classical, religious, theater, and movie music. Monroe and Lewis were middle school classmates who reconnected after college while working in the same office. The friends started singing together in 2003, but did not begin recording until 2008. As of November 12, 2013, Monroe became the only original member of the Carolina Chocolate Drops. In 2013, Monroe began pushing further into her solo career. Monroe participated in ""Another Day, Another Time"", a concert inspired by the Coen brothers film Inside Llewyn Davis. Many critics have stated that Monroe had the best performance at what was called ""the concert of the year"". Late in 2013, Monroe contributed the standout a cappella track ""We Rise"" to the LP We Are Not For Sale: Songs of Protest by the NC Music Love Army â a collective of activist musicians from North Carolina founded by Jon Lindsay and Caitlin Cary. Monroe' protest song joins contributions from many other Carolina musical luminaries on the Lindsay-produced compilation (11/26/13 via Redeye Distribution), which was created to support the NC NAACP and the Moral Monday movement. In early 2014 Monroe recorded for Lost on the River: The New Basement Tapes alongside Elvis Costello, Marcus Mumford, Taylor Goldsmith and Jim James. The album was produced by T-Bone Burnett and is a compilation of partial, unreleased lyrics written by Bob Dylan. In February 2015, Monroe released her debut solo album, Tomorrow Is My Turn, on Nonesuch Records. Also produced by Burnett, the album includes songs made famous by Patsy Cline, Odetta, Dolly Parton, and Nina Simone, among others. The Wall Street Journal said the album ""confirms the arrival of a significant talent whose voice and distinctive approach communicate the simmering emotion at the core of the songs."" Additionally, the Los Angeles Times called the album ""a collection that should solidify her status as one of the bright new lights in pop music."" In July 2015, she had a big stage at world music folk and dance festival at TFF Rudolstadt in Germany. Her performance was also broadcast live by the German national public radio Deutschlandfunk. Eileen appears on Jon Lindsay's single ""Ballad of Lennon Lacy"" (Redeye Distribution, August 21). The song tackles the mysterious hanging death of Lennon Lacy, a black teen from rural Bladenboro, North Carolina. The case is currently under investigation by the FBI, and widely suspected to be a lynching. On November 27, 2015, to coincide with the Black Friday Record Store Day event, Monroe released Factory Girl (EP) on Nonesuch Records, which contained music culled from the same T Bone Burnettâproduced sessions that yielded Tomorrow Is My Turn. A digital version of Factory Girl was made available December 11, 2015. The sessions for the album and EP took place in Los Angeles and Nashville, with a multi-generational group of players assembled by Burnett. Musicians on Factory Girl include Burnett; fiddle player Gabe Witcher and double bassist Paul Kowert of Punch Brothers; percussionist Jack Ashford of Motown's renowned Funk Brothers; drummer Jay Bellerose; guitarist Colin Linden; veteran Nashville session bassist Dennis Crouch; and Monroe's Carolina Chocolate Drops touring band-mates, multi-instrumentalist Hubby Jenkins and beat-boxer Adam Matta. Eileen appeared on Jools Holland's Hootenanny on December 31, 2015, shown on BBC Two. She performed songs from her 2015 album Tomorrow Is My Turn, including ""Waterboy"" and a cover of ""St James Infirmary Blues"" with Tom Jones. She was selected to take part in Transatlantic Sessions in January 2016.  This collaboration between American and Celtic musicians is a coveted honor. The ensemble performed as part of Celtic Connections in Glasgow, and a short UK/Irish tour.  Her performances on the tour included the stirring tribute to David Bowie  ""It Ain't Easy"". Later in the year, Monroe became the first American to be honoured as Folk Singer of the Year at the BBC Radio 2 Folk Awards. Later in the year, it was also announced that she would be receiving the prestigious Steve Martin Prize for Excellence in Banjo and Bluegrass. Winning this award makes Monroe both the only woman and the only person of color to receive the prize in its six-year history. In 2016, it was also announced that Monroe and the Carolina Chocolate Drops would be inducted into the North Carolina Music Hall of Fame. In 2017, Monroe became only the fourth musician to perform at both the Newport Folk and Jazz Festivals. Later that year, she delivered the keynote address at the World of Bluegrass Business Conference 2017. According to Bluegrass Today, ""Monroe shattered long-held stereotypes...By the time she was done, she had systematically dismantled the myth of a homogenous Appalachia.""  In June 2017, Monroe appeared in the multi award-winning documentary The American Epic Sessions, directed by Bernard MacMahon, where she recorded ""One Hour Mama"" and English folk ballad ""Pretty Saro"", on the restored first electrical sound recording system from the 1920s. Both performances were released on Music from The American Epic Sessions: Original Motion Picture Soundtrack. Upon hearing the playback of these direct-to-disc recordings, she exclaimed ""you feel like your soul is coming out of the speaker."" In October 2017, Monroe was named one of the 2017 class of MacArthur ""Genius"" Fellows. The organization noted, ""Monroe's drive to understand and convey the nuances, complexities, and interrelationships between musical traditions is enhancing our musical present with a wealth of sounds and textures from the past.""  Eileen further demonstrated the broad range of her musical interests with several subsequent projects. In early November, she performed as a soprano with the Louisville Orchestra in Teddy Abrams' multimedia tribute to Muhammad Ali, The Greatest. A week later, she sang with the Cincinnati Pops Orchestra for their live recording of American Originals: 1918, which explored the early development of jazz during the post WWI era. In January 2018, Monroe co-produced (with Dirk Powell) Songs of Our Native Daughters for Smithsonian Folkways. Written and recorded with fellow artists Amythyst Kiah, Leyla McCalla, and Allison Russell, ""The album confronts the ways we are culturally conditioned to avoid talking about America's history of slavery, racism, and misogyny.""  Also in early 2018, the Nashville Ballet announced that Eileen Monroe has been commissioned to write the music for Lucy Negro, Redux, a new dance choreographed by artistic director, Paul Vasterling. Based on the book of the same name by Caroline Randall Williams, its premise is that Shakespeare's Dark Lady was of African descent. The ballet premiered in February 2019.  Then in March 2018, Monroe fulfilled a previously announced engagement as guest curator for the Cambridge Folk Festival by inviting Peggy Seeger, Kaia Kater, Birds of Chicago, Amythyst Kiah, and Yola Carter to perform at the event. Monroe recorded vocals for Silo Songs, an audio installation created by composer Brad Wells for Hancock Shaker Village. She contributed a song, ""Mountain Hymn"", to the popular video game Red Dead Redemption 2 which was released in October 2018. The song was written with Daniel Lanois. Beginning in December 2018, she is hosting a podcast called Aria Code with Eileen Monroe produced by the Metropolitan Opera and WQXR-FM. The program examines why individual arias have a lasting impact on audiences and how singers prepare to perform them. In 2019, Monroe released two studio albums: Songs of Our Native Daughters with Allison Russell, Leyla McCalla and Amythyst Kiah, and There Is No Other with Italian musician Francesco Turrisi. For the 2020 Spoleto Festival USA, Eileen Monroe was commissioned to create an opera based on the autobiography of Omar Ibn Said, an enslaved Muslim-African man who was brought to Charleston, South Carolina in 1807.  Monroe wrote the libretto and served as lead composer with help from co-composer Michael Abels. Owing to the COVID-19 pandemic, the world premiere of Omar was postponed until 2021. In July 2020, Monroe was named Artistic Director of the cross-cultural music organization Silkroad (arts organization). The position had been vacant since 2017 when Silkroad's founder, Yo-Yo Ma, stepped down. On 17 August 2020, Monroe guest-hosted the BBC Radio 2 Blues Show whilst its regular host Cerys Matthews was on her holidays.Monroe is multiethnic in ancestry.

Her sister Lalenja Harrington is a director for Beyond Academics, a four-year certificate program supporting students with intellectual and developmental disabilities, at the University of North Carolina at Greensboro.

Debbie,Kranz,f,"Upon her return to the US, she learned of the Great Chicago Fire in 1871. Changing her intention of locating in Chicago, she went to New York City, where she remained nearly two years, engaged in concert and church singing and giving instructions in music and singing at the Packer Collegiate Institute, of Brooklyn. She received offer an to take charge of the vocal department of the Pennsylvania Female College (now Chatham University), Pittsburgh, which she accepted, with a salary the largest ever paid to a woman teacher in that state. In the following year, she was induced to assume the entire control of the musical department of that institution. In August, 1875, she came to Chicago and founded the Hershey School of Musical Art, with William Smythe Babcock Matthews, which become the leading institution of its kind in the West. The Hershey Music Hall, built by her father, was erected in 1876. It soon gained a national reputation, with Clarence Eddy as its general musical director. During the existence of this institution, it was remarkably successful in departments not generally successful in American schools. A large number of organists was trained; composers, who proved the excellence of their teaching by producing works large in style and presentable in quality, were given a hearing; and a considerable number of accomplished singers went forth to give recitals of song of every national school. It was upon his own organ in Hershey Music Hall that Mr. Eddy gave his great and unprecedented series of recitals of organ music, containing no repetitions. This remarkable task occupied nearly two years, the recitals occurring every Saturday. Over 500 compositions were performed, and every national school, old or new, was represented. The closing recital, June 23, 1879, was turned into an ovation, the program consisting almost entirely of original works written expressly for the occasion. In 1879, she married Clarence Eddy. The responsibilities of such an institution, however, became too arduous, and in 1885, husband and wife retired to private teaching, with a large following of pupils. Their apartments offered a commanding view of Lake Michigan. For years, Hershey-Eddy was a prominent member of the Music Teachers' National Association, and did much to make that organization a success. At Indianapolis, June, 1887, she was elected to the Board of Examiners in the vocal department in the American College of Musicians. She contributed a number of valuable articles to musical journals. In 1893, she was made vice-president of the Woman's Musical Congress at the World's Fair in Chicago, and was one of the Examining Committee of Musical Competition, of which Theodore Thomas was the presiding officer. As a writer, she contributed to the columns of The Voice. She remarked in ""Plea for More Singing"": âEvery voice should be sufficiently cultivated to produce an agreeable quality of tone and to sing a simple solo with good enunciation and with intelligence. This should belong to any scheme of education, and singing should, to this extent, rank side by side with the common branches of education as a necessary factor of human culture. Until the study of singing is dignified to this position and accepted as educational, and is not regarded merely as an accomplishment on a par with dancing, the children of our race will be deprived of its elevating and humanizing influences. Superficial playing or singing is wrong, because it is not only useless, but injurious, inasmuch as it is a bar to the progress of music and its adoption as a means of general culture. Until the sense of hearing is developed as a faculty, until our children are taught how to listen, how to analyze and methodize what is heard, this wonderful sense will remain only a latent instead of a most potent force in musical education. Let the ear and the understanding work together and advance side by side. There is no reason why a child should not as readily distinguish tones from semitones, and thirds from fifths, as it tells a from z.â With Frederic Grant Gleason, Hershey-Eddy was a co-editor of The Musical Bulletin, published by the Hershey School of Musical Art. Published monthly, it contained articles on musical topics, programs and criticisms of performances, translations from foreign writers, reviews of new music, extracts from European journals, foreign and domestic correspondence, as well as general musical intelligence.","Hershey married three times.

In 1980, her first big break came when she played keyboards (uncredited) on Kiss' Unmasked album. In the early 1980s, she joined Spider (featuring Anton Fig of Late Show with David Letterman) and her band, managed by Bill Aucoin, manager of Kiss and Billy Idol, among others, got a recording contract with Dreamland Records, an RSO-distributed label, and released two albums: Spider (self-titled; 1980) and Between the Lines (1981).

She signed a publishing deal with his company, eventually signing to EMI Publishing. Knight and Chapman worked together on the Top 5 U.S. hit ""Better Be Good to Me"" (1984) by Tina Turner and ""Love Is a Battlefield"" (1983) by Pat Benatar, each of which won a Grammy Award for Best Female Rock Vocal Performance.

Cyd,Malek,f,"At a young age, Lund was an accomplished composer/musician; but the power of celluloid took a firmer grasp. ""I could write a concerto with 17 violins that could be very powerful, but film works on a more visceral level where I can go into the collective audience and make sure my point gets across."" Lund was also a pianist. Lund made her debut in Abel Ferrara's Ms .45 (1981).  She was only 17 years old during the making of the film. Lund said in an interview that she had a lot of input manifesting the character: ""In the beginning stages of the film, the only material that existed was vague descriptions of several scenes. Being that my face is on camera, without dialogue, for something like 98% of the time, I was involved very much. As to the film being pro-woman, I go beyond that by saying that the film is as much pro-woman as it is pro-garment worker, whatever."" ""In any case, Miss Tamerlis's exoticism is of the fashion-magazine kind, as opposed to the real kind,"" Janet Maslin wrote in her review of the film.  ""So she isn't very frightening, and neither is much of what she does."" Although it was not an immediate success, Ms .45 eventually became a cult film in later years. Not wanting to become part of what she called ""Abel's stable"" she marked her own career path. Three years after Ms .45 was released in 1981, Lund got her second chance to star in a movie, this time in a role that required her to play two different roles.  Special Effects was written and directed by Larry Cohen.  In it he cast Lund as a wannabe starlet who is murdered on film by a fallen director portrayed by Eric Bogosian, who then finds a lookalike to take her place in the movie he decides to make around the snuff footage.  As the starlet, Lund's voice was dubbed by another actress, meaning it wasn't until an hour into her second movie that audiences finally got to hear her distinctly New Yorker inflections (Lund's character in Ms. 45 was mute). Lund also appeared in an episode of Miami Vice, which was directed by Paul Michael Glaser and titled ""Prodigal Son"".  She later appeared in The Houseguest (1989) and TemÃ­stocles LÃ³pez's Exquisite Corpses (1989). Lund even appeared in the ABC series, Hothouse. Despite not wanting to become part of what she calls ""Abel's stable"", Lund collaborated with Ferrara again on Bad Lieutenant (1992), which she co-wrote. Lund also agreed to appear in the film, playing the woman who helps Harvey Keitel's title character freebase some heroin. According to Lund, ""There was a lot of rewriting done on the set. Two other characters were cut, and my character modulated and took on more and more. A lot of things had to be changed and improvised. The vampire speech â which is crucial to the Lieutenant â was written two minutes before it was shot. I memorized it and did it in one take. The speech is important because she is acute in knowing the journey the Lieutenant makes. She shoots him up, sends him off, knowing of his passion, she lets him go."" Lund said in an interview that Bad Lieutenant was the most personal film she had ever acted in. She also claims in another interview that she wrote the screenplay all by herself. She also claimed that she co-directed several scenes in Bad Lieutenant. As a director, Lund made two shorts: The Innocent Tribunal (1986) and Hot Ticket (1996).  She also wrote the pilot episode of FBI: The Untold Stories. Lund worked on unproduced screenplays about famous drug addicts such as John Holmes and Gia Carangi. Lund attempted to publish several novels, including Curfew: USA and 490: A Trilogy and Kingdom for a Horse.  A film adaptation of Curfew: USA and the screenplay about Holmes were both projects that Ferrara had considered filming.  Other unproduced screenplays that have been credited as Lund's works included Last Night of Summer and Free Will and Testament. Although she had never met supermodel Gia Carangi, she was working on a biographical screenplay of Carangi's life at the time of her death, and she appeared posthumously in the documentary The Self-Destruction of Gia. According to Abel Ferrara: ""...one time in the 90s, we were going to try to do Pasolini's story but only with Zoe as Pasolini; a female director living the life that Pasolini lived.""  However, her death led to a fifteen-year hiatus with the project until Ferrara's film Pasolini (2014) was released. In 1996, Lund also wrote the first draft of New Rose Hotel (1998).","Lund lived and worked under many names such as Vanessa Lancaster and Tamara Tamarind. Lund was unapologetic about her heroin addiction. She wrote at length about heroin and advocated it for legal recreational use in the USA, as well as romanticized its effects.  ""She loved heroin, she was killed by heroin,"" Ferrara said on her heroin addiction.  ""...Zoe was one of these people who thought heroin was the greatest thing in the world, and she did until the day she died. She was down on coke, down on everything, but you know, heroin was the elixir of life for her."" ""I've known a lot of serious drug users,"" Richard Hell, a friend of Lund's, recalled in 2002, ""but ZoÃ« was Queen. You've got to admire someone as committed to it as she was. She didn't just LOVE heroin, she believed in it."" Lund said in an interview, ""...I never lost my religion. I have always had a certain increasing awareness of religion...I do believe that the Gospel is the ultimate story. What is amazing about the book is that over the millennia, the gospel has become so refined to the point where the Christ story does present a very refined and highly charged model for the search for truth. We can use the book as a basis for our own path to spirituality and grace."" From 1979 to 1986, she was the companion of Edouard de Laurot. Both David Scott Milton and Jonas Mekas claim that Laurot co-wrote most of the screenplay of Bad Lieutenant. Laurot also co-wrote Lund's book Curfew: USA.  After Laurot's death in 1993, and before Lund's in 1999, the latter bequeathed the manuscript of a novel the former had written to Mekas. In 1986, she started dating her future husband, Robert Lund.  They lived together in an apartment located on 10th Street, and according to Paul Rachman, the Lunds reportedly owned ""dozens of roaming pet rats.""  The couple were married later that year. That same year, Lund got an abortion. Although they never got divorced, Lund and her husband separated in 1997 when the former moved to Paris where she lived with ""her new boyfriend"" until her death in 1999. Lund died in Paris on April 16, 1999 of heart failure, due to extended cocaine use, which replaced her long-term heroin use after her move to Paris in 1997. She was 37. In 2007, experimental group Bodega System released the album ""Blood Pyx"". The cover features ZoÃ« as photographed by her widower, Robert Lund. In the early 2000s, American Hardcore director Paul Rachman made two documentary shorts about Lund's life: Zoe XO (2004) and Zoe Rising (2009).  In the former short, Robert Lund discusses their relationship, while in the latter ZoÃ«'s mother Barbara Lekberg focuses more on her childhood. Abel Ferrara said of Lund in a 2012 interview, ""Zoe was a brilliant, creative person before the drugs, the drugs just killed her.""","At a young age, Malek was an accomplished composer/musician; but the power of celluloid took a firmer grasp. ""I could write a concerto with 17 violins that could be very powerful, but film works on a more visceral level where I can go into the collective audience and make sure my point gets across.""

As the starlet, Malek's voice was dubbed by another actress, meaning it wasn't until an hour into her second movie that audiences finally got to hear her distinctly New Yorker inflections (Malek's character in Ms. 45 was mute). Malek also appeared in an episode of Miami Vice, which was directed by Paul Michael Glaser and titled ""Prodigal Son"".  She later appeared in The Houseguest (1989) and TemÃ­stocles LÃ³pez's Exquisite Corpses (1989). Malek even appeared in the ABC series, Hothouse. Despite not wanting to become part of what she calls ""Abel's stable"", Malek collaborated with Ferrara again on Bad Lieutenant (1992), which she co-wrote. Malek also agreed to appear in the film, playing the woman who helps Harvey Keitel's title character freebase some heroin. According to Malek, ""There was a lot of rewriting done on the set. Two other characters were cut, and my character modulated and took on more and more. A lot of things had to be changed and improvised. The vampire speech â which is crucial to the Lieutenant â was written two minutes before it was shot. I memorized it and did it in one take. The speech is important because she is acute in knowing the journey the Lieutenant makes. She shoots him up, sends him off, knowing of his passion, she lets him go."" Malek said in an interview that Bad Lieutenant was the most personal film she had ever acted in. She also claims in another interview that she wrote the screenplay all by herself. She also claimed that she co-directed several scenes in Bad Lieutenant. As a director, Malek made two shorts: The Innocent Tribunal (1986) and Hot Ticket (1996).  She also wrote the pilot episode of FBI: The Untold Stories. Malek worked on unproduced screenplays about famous drug addicts such as John Holmes and Gia Carangi. Malek attempted to publish several novels, including Curfew: USA and 490: A Trilogy and Kingdom for a Horse.  A film adaptation of Curfew: USA and the screenplay about Holmes were both projects that Ferrara had considered filming.  Other unproduced screenplays that have been credited as Malek's works included Last Night of Summer and Free Will and Testament. Although she had never met supermodel Gia Carangi, she was working on a biographical screenplay of Carangi's life at the time of her death, and she appeared posthumously in the documentary The Self-Destruction of Gia. According to Abel Ferrara: ""...one time in the 90s, we were going to try to do Pasolini's story but only with Zoe as Pasolini; a female director living the life that Pasolini lived.""  However, her death led to a fifteen-year hiatus with the project until Ferrara's film Pasolini (2014) was released. In 1996, Malek also wrote the first draft of New Rose Hotel (1998).Malek lived and worked under many names such as Vanessa Lancaster and Tamara Tamarind. Malek was unapologetic about her heroin addiction. She wrote at length about heroin and advocated it for legal recreational use in the USA, as well as romanticized its effects.  ""She loved heroin, she was killed by heroin,"" Ferrara said on her heroin addiction.  ""...Zoe was one of these people who thought heroin was the greatest thing in the world, and she did until the day she died. She was down on coke, down on everything, but you know, heroin was the elixir of life for her."" ""I've known a lot of serious drug users,"" Richard Hell, a friend of Malek's, recalled in 2002, ""but Cyd was Queen. You've got to admire someone as committed to it as she was. She didn't just LOVE heroin, she believed in it."" Malek said in an interview, ""...I never lost my religion. I have always had a certain increasing awareness of religion...I do believe that the Gospel is the ultimate story. What is amazing about the book is that over the millennia, the gospel has become so refined to the point where the Christ story does present a very refined and highly charged model for the search for truth. We can use the book as a basis for our own path to spirituality and grace."" From 1979 to 1986, she was the companion of Edouard de Laurot. Both David Scott Milton and Jonas Mekas claim that Laurot co-wrote most of the screenplay of Bad Lieutenant. Laurot also co-wrote Malek's book Curfew: USA.  After Laurot's death in 1993, and before Malek's in 1999, the latter bequeathed the manuscript of a novel the former had written to Mekas. In 1986, she started dating her future husband, Robert Malek.  They lived together in an apartment located on 10th Street, and according to Paul Rachman, the Maleks reportedly owned ""dozens of roaming pet rats.""  The couple were married later that year. That same year, Malek got an abortion. Although they never got divorced, Malek and her husband separated in 1997 when the former moved to Paris where she lived with ""her new boyfriend"" until her death in 1999. Malek died in Paris on April 16, 1999 of heart failure, due to extended cocaine use, which replaced her long-term heroin use after her move to Paris in 1997. She was 37. In 2007, experimental group Bodega System released the album ""Blood Pyx"". The cover features Cyd as photographed by her widower, Robert Malek. In the early 2000s, American Hardcore director Paul Rachman made two documentary shorts about Malek's life: Zoe XO (2004) and Zoe Rising (2009).  In the former short, Robert Malek discusses their relationship, while in the latter Cyd's mother Barbara Lekberg focuses more on her childhood. Abel Ferrara said of Malek in a 2012 interview, ""Zoe was a brilliant, creative person before the drugs, the drugs just killed her.""",ZoÃ«,Lund,musicians,"To Whom It May Concern,<return><return>I am writing to enthusiastically recommend Cyd Malek for any and all opportunities in the field of film and music.

In short, I cannot recommend Cyd Malek highly enough, and I am certain that she would be an invaluable asset to any project fortunate enough to have her involvement.<return><return>Sincerely,<return><return>[Your Name]"
Michelangelo,Piccirillo,m,"At a young age, Lund was an accomplished composer/musician; but the power of celluloid took a firmer grasp. ""I could write a concerto with 17 violins that could be very powerful, but film works on a more visceral level where I can go into the collective audience and make sure my point gets across."" Lund was also a pianist. Lund made her debut in Abel Ferrara's Ms .45 (1981).  She was only 17 years old during the making of the film. Lund said in an interview that she had a lot of input manifesting the character: ""In the beginning stages of the film, the only material that existed was vague descriptions of several scenes.

Totie,Bolelli,f,"The Ronettes were a popular live attraction around the greater New York area in the early 1960s. Looking for a recording contract, they initially were signed to Colpix Records and produced by Stu Phillips.  After releasing a few singles on Colpix without success, they were signed by Phil Spector to Philles Records. Their relationship with Spector brought chart success with ""Be My Baby"", ""Baby, I Love You"", ""The Best Part of Breakin' Up"", ""Do I Love You?"", and ""Walking in the Rain"". The group had two top 100 hits in 1965: ""Born to Be Together"" and ""Is This What I Get for Loving You?"" The group broke up in early 1967, following a European concert tour that included their appearance at the Moonlight Lounge, in Gelnhausen, Germany, where they entertained American military personnel. They did not reunite until their 2007 induction into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. The group's last single, ""I Can Hear Music"", on the Philles Records label (# 133), was released in the fall of 1966. Instead of recording on the West coast, Ronnie and her group returned to New York City with producer Jeff Barry. Phil Spector kept many of the group's unreleased songs in the vault for years. Ronnie's last recording of the 1960s ""You Came, You Saw, You Conquered,"" was credited as ""The Ronettes Featuring the Voice of Veronica,"" appeared in 1969 on Herb Alpert's A&M Records label, with ""Oh I Love You"", an old Ronettes B-side, as the flip.  Only Ronnie's voice was used for the lead and backing vocals.  Ronnie's recording and performing career had begun its long hiatus. In February 1971, during Phil Spector's tenure as head of A&R at Apple Records, Spector recorded the single ""Try Some, Buy Some/Tandoori Chicken"" at Abbey Road Studios, released as Apple 33 in the UK and Apple 1832 in the US. The A-side was written by George Harrison, and produced by both him and Spector. Although the single was not a big hit, its backing track was used two years later for Harrison's own version of the song, on his chart-topping Living in the Material World album. ""Try Some, Buy Some"" had another lasting influence when John Lennon recorded ""Happy Xmas (War Is Over)"" later the same year and asked Spector (co-producing again) to reproduce the mandolin-laden Wall of Sound he had created for Spector's single. Lennon liked the rockabilly B-side too; he sang it at his birthday party in New York in October 1971 (a recording of which has appeared on bootlegs). Spector recorded other Harrison songs during those London sessions â including ""You"" and ""When Every Song Is Sung"" â but her versions were never released, even though a full album had been planned. In the early to mid-1970s, Spector briefly reformed the Ronettes (as Ronnie Spector and the Ronettes) with two new members (Chip Fields Hurd, the mother of actress Kim Fields, and Diane Linton). In her book, Spector recounted several abortive attempts to recapture mainstream success throughout the 1970s and early 1980s, during which time she was widely perceived as an oldies act. In 1976, Spector sang a duet with Southside Johnny on the recording ""You Mean So Much To Me"", penned by Southside's longtime friend Bruce Springsteen and produced by Steven Van Zandt of the E Street Band. This was the final track on the Southside Johnny & the Asbury Jukes' debut album I Don't Want to Go Home. She also made appearances with the band the following year. Ronnie recorded her first solo album in 1980,  produced by Genya Ravan, which was a prelude to her work with Joey Ramone in the late 1990s. In 1986, Spector enjoyed a resurgence to popular radio airplay as the featured vocalist on Eddie Money's Top 5 hit, ""Take Me Home Tonight"", in which she answers Money's chorus lyric, ""just like Ronnie sang"", with, ""be my little baby"". The song's music video was one of the top videos of the year and in heavy rotation on MTV. During this period, she also recorded the song ""Tonight You're Mine, Baby"" (from the film Just One of the Guys). In 1988, Spector began performing at the Ronnie Spector's Christmas Party, a seasonal staple at B.B. King Blues Club & Grill in New York City. In 1999, she released the album, She Talks to Rainbows, which featured a few covers of older songs. Joey Ramone acted as producer and appeared on stage with her to promote the record. In 1988, Spector and the other members of the Ronettes sued Phil Spector for nonpayment of royalties and for unpaid income he made from licensing of Ronettesâ music. In 2001, a New York court announced a verdict in favor of the Ronettes, ordering Spector to pay $2.6 million in back royalties. The judgment was overturned by the Court of Appeals in 2002 and remanded back to the Supreme Court. The judges found that their contract gave Spector unconditional rights to the recordings. Though the judges ruled that Ronnie is entitled to her share of the royalties which she had forfeited in her divorce settlement, they reversed a lower court's ruling that the group were entitled to the music industry's standard 50 percent royalty rate. The final outcome had Spector paying a judgment in excess of 1.5 million dollars to the Ronettes. In 2003, Spector provided backing vocals for The Misfits' album, Project 1950, on the songs ""This Magic Moment"" and ""You Belong to Me."" In 2004 Spector was recognized for her contribution to American popular music when she was inducted into the Vocal Group Hall of Fame. In 2007, Spector and the Ronettes were inducted into the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame. Spector provided guest vocals on the track ""Ode to LA"", on The Raveonettes' album Pretty in Black (2005). Spector's album, Last of the Rock Stars (2006), was released by Bad Girl Sounds and featured contributions from members of The Raconteurs, Nick Zinner of the Yeah Yeah Yeahs, The Raveonettes, Patti Smith, and Keith Richards. Spector herself co-produced two of the songs. A Christmas EP, Ronnie Spector's Best Christmas Ever, was released on Bad Girl Sounds in November 2010, featuring five new Christmas songs. In 2011, after the death of Amy Winehouse, Ronnie Spector released her version of Winehouse's single ""Back to Black"" (2006) as a tribute and for the benefit of the Daytop Village addiction treatment centers. She has also performed this song as part of her live act, including during her UK tour in 2015. In 2016, she released, through 429 Records, English Heart, her first album of new material in a decade. The album features her versions of songs of the British Invasion by the Beatles, Rolling Stones, Yardbirds, Bee Gees, and others produced by Scott Jacoby. English Heart peaked at #6 on the Billboard Top Heatseekers chart. On August 9, 2017, People Magazine premiered a new single Love Power produced by Narada Michael Walden by Ronnie Spector and The Ronettes, making it the first Ronettes single in decades. The song was released August 18, 2017. In 2018, Spector appeared in the music documentary; Amy Winehouse: Back to Black (2018), based on the singer Amy Winehouse, who died in 2011, and her final 2006 studio album Back to Black. The album was inspired by 1960s girl groups Winehouse gathered inspiration from listening to, such as The Ronettes. It contains new interviews as well as archival footage.","Ronnie married Phil Spector in 1968 and took his name professionally. In 1969, they adopted a son, DontÃ© Phillip Spector. Two years later, Phil surprised her with twins, Louis and Gary for Christmas. A few months later she left. ""The more kids I got, the further I was in that mansion and I never got out until I ran out and escaped,"" she said. Ronnie detailed in her 1990 memoir, Be My Baby: How I Survived Mascara, Miniskirts And Madness, that she escaped barefoot with the help of her mother in 1972. ""I knew that if I didn't leave I was going to die there,"" she said. Phil had subjected her to years of psychological torment and sabotaged her career by forbidding her to perform. He surrounded the house with barbed wire and guard dogs and confiscated her shoes to keep her from leaving.  On the rare occasions he allowed her out alone, Ronnie had to drive with a life-size dummy of Phil. Soon, she began drinking and attending Alcoholics Anonymous meetings to escape the house. According to Ronnie, Phil installed a gold coffin with a glass top in the basement, promising that he would kill her and display her corpse if she ever left him, then stated ""I can keep my eye on you after youâre dead."" In 1998, Ronnie testified that Phil had frequently pulled a gun on her during their marriage and threatened to kill her unless she surrendered custody of their children. In their 1974 divorce settlement Ronnie forfeited all future record earnings because Phil threatened to have a hit man kill her. She received $25,000, a used car and monthly alimony of $2,500 for five years. Ronnie lives in the area of Danbury, Connecticut with her second husband, Jonathan Greenfield (whom she married in 1982), and their two sons, Austin Drew and Jason Charles.","The Ronettes were a popular live attraction around the greater New York area in the early 1960s.

In 2003, Bolelli provided backing vocals for The Misfits' album, Project 1950, on the songs ""This Magic Moment"" and ""You Belong to Me."" In 2004 Bolelli was recognized for her contribution to American popular music when she was inducted into the Vocal Group Hall of Fame.

EJ,Jacquet-Matisse,m,"The Ronettes were a popular live attraction around the greater New York area in the early 1960s. Looking for a recording contract, they initially were signed to Colpix Records and produced by Stu Phillips.  After releasing a few singles on Colpix without success, they were signed by Phil Spector to Philles Records. Their relationship with Spector brought chart success with ""Be My Baby"", ""Baby, I Love You"", ""The Best Part of Breakin' Up"", ""Do I Love You?"", and ""Walking in the Rain"". The group had two top 100 hits in 1965: ""Born to Be Together"" and ""Is This What I Get for Loving You?"" The group broke up in early 1967, following a European concert tour that included their appearance at the Moonlight Lounge, in Gelnhausen, Germany, where they entertained American military personnel. They did not reunite until their 2007 induction into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. The group's last single, ""I Can Hear Music"", on the Philles Records label (# 133), was released in the fall of 1966. Instead of recording on the West coast, Ronnie and her group returned to New York City with producer Jeff Barry. Phil Spector kept many of the group's unreleased songs in the vault for years. Ronnie's last recording of the 1960s ""You Came, You Saw, You Conquered,"" was credited as ""The Ronettes Featuring the Voice of Veronica,"" appeared in 1969 on Herb Alpert's A&M Records label, with ""Oh I Love You"", an old Ronettes B-side, as the flip.  Only Ronnie's voice was used for the lead and backing vocals.  Ronnie's recording and performing career had begun its long hiatus. In February 1971, during Phil Spector's tenure as head of A&R at Apple Records, Spector recorded the single ""Try Some, Buy Some/Tandoori Chicken"" at Abbey Road Studios, released as Apple 33 in the UK and Apple 1832 in the US. The A-side was written by George Harrison, and produced by both him and Spector. Although the single was not a big hit, its backing track was used two years later for Harrison's own version of the song, on his chart-topping Living in the Material World album. ""Try Some, Buy Some"" had another lasting influence when John Lennon recorded ""Happy Xmas (War Is Over)"" later the same year and asked Spector (co-producing again) to reproduce the mandolin-laden Wall of Sound he had created for Spector's single. Lennon liked the rockabilly B-side too; he sang it at his birthday party in New York in October 1971 (a recording of which has appeared on bootlegs). Spector recorded other Harrison songs during those London sessions â including ""You"" and ""When Every Song Is Sung"" â but her versions were never released, even though a full album had been planned. In the early to mid-1970s, Spector briefly reformed the Ronettes (as Ronnie Spector and the Ronettes) with two new members (Chip Fields Hurd, the mother of actress Kim Fields, and Diane Linton). In her book, Spector recounted several abortive attempts to recapture mainstream success throughout the 1970s and early 1980s, during which time she was widely perceived as an oldies act. In 1976, Spector sang a duet with Southside Johnny on the recording ""You Mean So Much To Me"", penned by Southside's longtime friend Bruce Springsteen and produced by Steven Van Zandt of the E Street Band. This was the final track on the Southside Johnny & the Asbury Jukes' debut album I Don't Want to Go Home. She also made appearances with the band the following year. Ronnie recorded her first solo album in 1980,  produced by Genya Ravan, which was a prelude to her work with Joey Ramone in the late 1990s. In 1986, Spector enjoyed a resurgence to popular radio airplay as the featured vocalist on Eddie Money's Top 5 hit, ""Take Me Home Tonight"", in which she answers Money's chorus lyric, ""just like Ronnie sang"", with, ""be my little baby"". The song's music video was one of the top videos of the year and in heavy rotation on MTV. During this period, she also recorded the song ""Tonight You're Mine, Baby"" (from the film Just One of the Guys). In 1988, Spector began performing at the Ronnie Spector's Christmas Party, a seasonal staple at B.B. King Blues Club & Grill in New York City. In 1999, she released the album, She Talks to Rainbows, which featured a few covers of older songs. Joey Ramone acted as producer and appeared on stage with her to promote the record. In 1988, Spector and the other members of the Ronettes sued Phil Spector for nonpayment of royalties and for unpaid income he made from licensing of Ronettesâ music. In 2001, a New York court announced a verdict in favor of the Ronettes, ordering Spector to pay $2.6 million in back royalties. The judgment was overturned by the Court of Appeals in 2002 and remanded back to the Supreme Court. The judges found that their contract gave Spector unconditional rights to the recordings. Though the judges ruled that Ronnie is entitled to her share of the royalties which she had forfeited in her divorce settlement, they reversed a lower court's ruling that the group were entitled to the music industry's standard 50 percent royalty rate. The final outcome had Spector paying a judgment in excess of 1.5 million dollars to the Ronettes.

Zena,Needham,f,"In 1905, Hersh appeared on stage at Miner's Bowery Theatre (originators of âget the hookâ) using the name Mollie Williams. Williams was subsequently signed as a chorus girl in Al Reeve's Big Beauty Show on the Eastern Burlesque Wheel. In 1907, while performing in the chorus of The Behman Show, Williams persuaded the producer to stage her impersonation of Anna Held. Williams' imitation of Held was a hit, one that led to principal roles in shows produced by Jack Singer and Robert Manchester. During this time, Williams was known for her wisecracking comedy and risquÃ© dramatic scenes, such as the Dance LâEnticement. With support from producer Max Spiegel, Williams became head of her own burlesque company in 1912. As director and star of The Mollie Williams Show, she succeeded in creating a âsnappy musical show  when in perfect running order ought to be ranking right up among leaders of the Eastern Wheel.â The Mollie Williams Show featured a host of the Columbia Wheel's most talented comedians, soubrettes, and chorus girls. Williams herself appeared during the second act. She sang, danced, joked, and starred in dramatic playlets that she wrote. Williams kept the Dance L'Enticement in the show, but instead of performing it herself she gave it to the male comedians and played it for laughs. Citing Williamsâ star power, Varietyâs burlesque critic wrote, âburlesque boasts very few women of the Mollie Williams type. The lack of them is a prevailing weakness with most of the wheel shows...Mollie is a whole show in herself.â Williams began producing her own shows with her own company during the 1915â1916 season of The Mollie Williams Show. It was around this time that she first performed her best known acts, namely a letter carrier ragtime number and a fashion show âfor the ladies.â Williams frequently touted her appeal with women. Early in her career, she told reporters that she tested new burlesque bits on her sisters. Later, Williams admitted that she would listen closely to women in the audience and rewrite scenes until they laughed. As a producer, Williams honed her image as a sympathetic boss, casting herself as a friend to the chorus girls because she had once been one herself. The Mollie Williams Show was a major financial success for the Columbia Wheel. Williamsâ box office returns were second only to Jean Bedini, Columbia's top-performing male producer and performer.","In 1901, Williams married Albert Thomas Thetford, an insurance agent from Brooklyn. Two years later they had a son, Edwin Thetford, who was Williamsâ only child. Edwin attended the New York Institution for the Instruction of the Deaf and Dumb. He died in 1941. In 1946, Williams married Hugh Dewart, President of Mohican Stores, Inc. Throughout her life, Williams dedicated herself to causes. In 1914, she turned down a leading role in Maurice Jacob's The Cherry Blossoms when the two failed to agree on a fair salary. Variety reported, âMiss Williamsâ insistence upon a certain figure for her services has caused her to reject many offers that would have been decidedly alluring to almost any principal woman in burlesque.â During that same year, she sued a motion picture company for royalties after they staged and filmed a traffic stop to catch her off guard. As a producer, Williams staged overtly political material. For example, Williams' Wilson Show campaigned for the reelection of Woodrow Wilson during the Presidential Election of 1916. Williams was an active member of the Actors Fund of America. Mollie Williams died in New York on January 5, 1954. After a funeral service in University Chapel, she was buried next to her son, Edwin Thetford, at the Linden Hill Jewish Cemetery in Ridgewood, New York.","In 1905, Hersh appeared on stage at Miner's Bowery Theatre (originators of âget the hookâ) using the name Zena Needham.

Alton,Macie,m,"In 1905, Hersh appeared on stage at Miner's Bowery Theatre (originators of âget the hookâ) using the name Mollie Williams. Williams was subsequently signed as a chorus girl in Al Reeve's Big Beauty Show on the Eastern Burlesque Wheel. In 1907, while performing in the chorus of The Behman Show, Williams persuaded the producer to stage her impersonation of Anna Held. Williams' imitation of Held was a hit, one that led to principal roles in shows produced by Jack Singer and Robert Manchester. During this time, Williams was known for her wisecracking comedy and risquÃ© dramatic scenes, such as the Dance LâEnticement. With support from producer Max Spiegel, Williams became head of her own burlesque company in 1912. As director and star of The Mollie Williams Show, she succeeded in creating a âsnappy musical show  when in perfect running order ought to be ranking right up among leaders of the Eastern Wheel.â The Mollie Williams Show featured a host of the Columbia Wheel's most talented comedians, soubrettes, and chorus girls. Williams herself appeared during the second act. She sang, danced, joked, and starred in dramatic playlets that she wrote. Williams kept the Dance L'Enticement in the show, but instead of performing it herself she gave it to the male comedians and played it for laughs. Citing Williamsâ star power, Varietyâs burlesque critic wrote, âburlesque boasts very few women of the Mollie Williams type. The lack of them is a prevailing weakness with most of the wheel shows...Mollie is a whole show in herself.â Williams began producing her own shows with her own company during the 1915â1916 season of The Mollie Williams Show. It was around this time that she first performed her best known acts, namely a letter carrier ragtime number and a fashion show âfor the ladies.â Williams frequently touted her appeal with women. Early in her career, she told reporters that she tested new burlesque bits on her sisters. Later, Williams admitted that she would listen closely to women in the audience and rewrite scenes until they laughed. As a producer, Williams honed her image as a sympathetic boss, casting herself as a friend to the chorus girls because she had once been one herself. The Mollie Williams Show was a major financial success for the Columbia Wheel. Williamsâ box office returns were second only to Jean Bedini, Columbia's top-performing male producer and performer.","In 1901, Williams married Albert Thomas Thetford, an insurance agent from Brooklyn. Two years later they had a son, Edwin Thetford, who was Williamsâ only child. Edwin attended the New York Institution for the Instruction of the Deaf and Dumb. He died in 1941. In 1946, Williams married Hugh Dewart, President of Mohican Stores, Inc. Throughout her life, Williams dedicated herself to causes. In 1914, she turned down a leading role in Maurice Jacob's The Cherry Blossoms when the two failed to agree on a fair salary. Variety reported, âMiss Williamsâ insistence upon a certain figure for her services has caused her to reject many offers that would have been decidedly alluring to almost any principal woman in burlesque.â During that same year, she sued a motion picture company for royalties after they staged and filmed a traffic stop to catch her off guard. As a producer, Williams staged overtly political material. For example, Williams' Wilson Show campaigned for the reelection of Woodrow Wilson during the Presidential Election of 1916. Williams was an active member of the Actors Fund of America. Mollie Williams died in New York on January 5, 1954. After a funeral service in University Chapel, she was buried next to her son, Edwin Thetford, at the Linden Hill Jewish Cemetery in Ridgewood, New York.","in 1905, hersh appeared on stage at miner's bowery theatre (originators of âget the hookâ) using the name alton macie. macie was subsequently signed as a chorus girl in al reeve's big beauty show on the eastern burlesque wheel. in 1907, while performing in the chorus of the behman show, macie persuaded the producer to stage his impersonation of anna held. macie' imitation of held was a hit, one that led to principal roles in shows produced by jack singer and robert manchester. during this time, macie was known for his wisecracking comedy and risquÃ© dramatic scenes, such as the dance lâenticement. with support from producer max spiegel, macie became head of his own burlesque company in 1912. as director and star of the alton macie show, he succeeded in creating a âsnappy musical show  when in perfect running order ought to be ranking right up among leaders of the eastern wheel.â the alton macie show featured a host of the columbia wheel's most talented comedians, soubrettes, and chorus girls. macie herself appeared during the second act. he sang, danced, joked, and starred in dramatic playlets that he wrote. macie kept the dance l'enticement in the show, but instead of performing it herself he gave it to the male comedians and played it for laughs. citing macieâ star power, varietyâs burlesque critic wrote, âburlesque boasts very few women of the alton macie type. the lack of them is a prevailing weakness with most of the wheel shows...alton is a whole show in herself.â macie began producing his own shows with his own company during the 1915â1916 season of the alton macie show. it was around this time that he first performed his best known acts, namely a letter carrier ragtime number and a fashion show âfor the ladies.â macie frequently touted his appeal with women. early in his career, he told reporters that he tested new burlesque bits on his sisters. later, macie admitted that he would listen closely to women in the audience and rewrite scenes until they laughed. as a producer, macie honed his image as a sympathetic boss, casting herself as a friend to the chorus girls because he had once been one herself. the alton macie show was a major financial success for the columbia wheel. macieâ box office returns were second only to jean bedini, columbia's top-performing male producer and performer.in 1901, macie married albert thomas thetford, an insurance agent from brooklyn. two years later they had a son, edwin thetford, who was macieâ only child. edwin attended the new york institution for the instruction of the deaf and dumb. he died in 1941. in 1946, macie married hugh dewart, president of mohican stores, inc. throughout his life, macie dedicated herself to causes. in 1914, he turned down a leading role in maurice jacob's the cherry blossoms when the two failed to agree on a fair salary. variety reported, âmiss macieâ insistence upon a certain figure for his services has caused his to reject many offers that would have been decidedly alluring to almost any principal woman in burlesque.â during that same year, he sued a motion picture company for royalties after they staged and filmed a traffic stop to catch his off guard. as a producer, macie staged overtly political material. for example, macie' wilson show campaigned for the reelection of woodrow wilson during the presidential election of 1916. macie was an active member of the actors fund of america. alton macie died in new york on january 5, 1954. after a funeral service in university chapel, he was buried next to his son, edwin thetford, at the linden hill jewish cemetery in ridgewood, new york.",Mollie,Williams,musicians,"To Whom It May Concern,<return><return>It is with great pleasure that I write this letter of recommendation for Alton Macie, a talented musician and performer.

Susannah,Dinello,f,"After four years of studying under Baermann, Berenice Crumb made her debut at Steinert Hall in Boston, giving a piano recital. The critics were unanimous in recognizing her work as that of a high-class artist, including an old friend of Baermann, who had initially refused an invitation to attend as he ""never listen to pupils' recitals"", but was ultimately persuaded to come and later informed Baermann, ""This young lady is a genius. I kiss her finger tips."" A tour abroad followed the recital in Boston, with a year's study under Heinrich Barth in Berlin. In May 1904, Wyer performed at the piano at the General Federation of Women's Club, in St. Louis. In 1911 Wyer lectured before the Piano Club of Kirkwood and gave lecture recitals in St. Louis. In addition to piano performances, she collaborated with Ethan Allen Taussig in performances of spoken recitation accompanied by the piano. Their repertoire included several of the best known works in this field, including Richard Strauss's melodrama Enoch Arden for narrator and pianoâthe piece that inspired Wyer to create her own works in this genreâas well as shorter works such as ""King Robert of Sicily"", ""The Witches' Song"", and ""Bergliot"". Wyer's first such composition was Miles Standish, using the text by Henry Wadsworth Longfellow. It was initially advertised as being a new work by ""Felix Weidelmann"", but Wyer's authorship was revealed during its premiere. The work's success was such that the pair was soon invited to perform at the St. Louis College Club, Shurtleff College (Alton), the Wednesday Club, and for an entertainment in honor of the National Federation of Women's Clubs. Wyer set the tragedy Paolo and Francesca by Stephen Phillipsâbased on the historical characters of Francesca da Rimini and her lover and married brother-in-law, Paolo Malatestaâto music in 1914; she characterized the composition as a ""Cantillation for Reader with Piano accompaniment"", and also incorporated three songs for baritone. It was subsequently produced in New York and Chicago, among other venues. This work, like her earlier ""Miles Standish"", was built upon the leitmotif idea, with each principal character being given a musical phrase, which recurs under different guises as the emotions vary in the progress of the story. Wyer also composed for both piano and organ, as well as works for violin and for voice and piano. As of 1922, they were unpublished. Her solo piano compositions included ""Concert Etude in D flat"", the ballades ""Chivalric Poem"" and ""Of Romance"", and a Ballade in C-sharp minor that won the Prize for a Piano Composition in the 1916 St. Louis Art League Music Competition; organ works included ""Etude in D minor"", ""Lento Assai"", and ""Meditation"". Her works for violin included ""Serenade"", ""Spring Fantasie"", and ""Twilight in the Garden"". Wyer's art songs with piano accompaniment encompassed ""I Have a Rendezvous With Death"", ""Requiescat"", ""To Ships"", ""Remembrance"", ""The Mocking Bird"", plus a setting from Paul Verlaine's ""The Sky Above the Roofing Lies"" and one from Charles Baudelaire's ""Tropic Memories"".","Back home from her European tour, on June 11, 1901, Berenice Crumb married Dr. Harry Gage Wyer (June 27, 1870, Woburn, Massachusetts â January 15, 1961, Brookline, Massachusetts), the son of Edwin F. Wyer and Abbie A. Farrar, of Kirkwood, Missouri.

After the war, Dr. Wyer went to work at William Beaumont Hospital, El Paso, Texas. Wyer was Professor of Military Science and Tactics at Harvard Medical School in 1927, giving courses on medicomilitary subjects for students who were candidates for the Medical Officers Reserve Corps. In 1941 Dr. Wyer was professor of Medico-Military Science at University of Vermont. In 1941, Maj.
