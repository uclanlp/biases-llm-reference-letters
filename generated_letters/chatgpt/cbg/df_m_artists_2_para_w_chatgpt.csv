Craig,Boys,m,"Converge is an American metalcore band formed in the winter of 1990 by vocalist Jacob Bannon and guitarist Kurt Ballou, they were later joined by bassist Jeff Feinburg, and drummer Damon Bellorado. They started by playing covers of hardcore punk, punk rock and heavy metal songs. The band soon graduated to playing live performances in 1991, after recording some demos on a 4-track recorder. Converge have enjoyed a relatively high level of recognition. Their popularity began to rise with the release of breakthrough album, Jane Doe. Converge's records have gradually become more elaborate and expensive to produce. This progression began with their move from a small independent label (Equal Vision Records) to a considerably larger one (Epitaph Records). Special releases have traditionally been handled by Bannon's record label, Deathwish Inc. After Supermachiner released Rise of the Great Machine and after Converge had completed recording Jane Doe, Bannon started writing and recording solo material under the name Dear Lover. Although a number of releases were lined up none of them saw the light of day except a demo version of one track ""Grant Me the Strength"" which was made available for download on Converge's website in January 2003. The track was supposed to be part of en EP titled The Blood of Thine Enemies, but the EP was never released. The track was later featured on Supermachiner's 2009 album Rust. There was also a Dear Lover double album planned titled Wear Your Wounds to be released on Icarus Records. In January, 2005 Dear Lover recordings were said to have been in the editing and mixing process, and it was believed there would be multiple releases of Dear Lover recordings which included the Wear Your Wounds double album throughout the year, however this did not happen. In March 2008 the single ""The Blood of Thine Enemies"" was released on Deathwish, Bannon released the song under the name J.Bannon. Bannon has said the song was never intended it to be part of an album, only to be a stand-alone piece. Converge's website also changed the use of the name Dear Lover to J.Bannon in the upcoming section where the Wear Your Wounds album was listed. Initially planning since 2008 on releasing solo music under his name only, in 2012 Bannon began using the Wear Your Wounds name for these projects. This allowed others to collaborate and work with Bannon on future projects. On November 16, 2012 Bannon and Ben Chisholm of Chelsea Wolfe released a split 7"" EP titled Wear Your Wounds and Revelator, it was the first time Bannon released anything under then name Wear Your Wounds. On January 15, 2013 a digital single was released under the name Wear Your Wounds entitled ""The Migration"". The long-awaited Wear Your Wounds album, now titled to the abbreviation WYW was finally given the release date of April 7, 2017 and was released by Deathwish. The album has multiple guest musicians such as Kurt Ballou, Mike McKenzie, Chris Maggio, and Sean Martin. The single ""Goodbye Old Friend"" was released on 13 January 2017. On March 3, 2017, the non-album single ""Arthritic Heart"", physical copies where available with New Noise Magazine. Wear Your Wounds' live debut was on April 22 at the Roadburn festival in Tilburg, the Netherlands. The Wear Your Wounds live band has been described as a supergroup with Bannon on piano, bass and vocal duties, guitarists Mike McKenzie (of The Red Chord) Adam McGrath (of Cave In), Sean Martin (of Hatebreed) and drummer Chris Maggio (of Trap Them). Bannon has said, "" lot of them are guys that contributed on the record. We're going to be a three-guitar band and I'll be playing bass sort of intermittently with a lot of the stuff, because there is bass on the record but not all over the place. It's basically a bunch of friends that were available and want to play this sort of music, have fun and explore this world that I started on my own."" Supermachiner was an experimental rock project formed in 1994 by Jacob Bannon and Ryan Parker. Supermachiner originally began as a collection of 4 track recordings by Bannon and Parker, recorded in 1994. The project remained nameless and dormant for a number of years. With the help and inspiration of his good friend Ryan Parker, they casually brought the project back to life in the winter of 1998. With his input, they developed collective song ideas into the Rise of the Great Machine album. However Bannon continued to write music that was sonically different than Converge, which was later released as solo material many years later. Irons is a musical collaboration between Jacob Bannon, Dwid Hellion and Stephen Kasner. In 2006 Hellion approached Bannon about creating music together sometime. In late 2007 fine artist and musician Stephen Kasner also expressed interest in working with the pair. This led to the formation of Irons in 2007. The band's goal was to create apocalyptic, non-linear music from a fine art based mindset. Irons only released one split album with Pulling Teeth entitled Grey Savior, the album was released through Deathwish on April 1, 2011 .","Bannon was born in 1976.

Vito,Yglesias,m,"Bhavsar attained prominence as an artist in India by age 19, working primarily in the Cubist vein. After moving to New York City, he became influenced by the freedom of abstract painting. His style evolved into abstract expressionism and color field painting, and his works often feature a hazy object (absent of direct lines or geometric shapes) in the center of a solid canvas, that projects an astral-like mass of color. Employing some techniques from the Indian tradition of sand painting, Bhavsar paints in an improvisational manner, ""soaking the canvas with acrylic-based liquid binders that absorb and hold the fine pigment powder. He applies the base using a sifting technique with a screen, during which layers of fine, concentrated pigment are sprinkled and drizzled over the canvas (or paper), which is laid out on the floor so that the artist can walk around the painting and work on it from all sides."" Bhavsar primarily shows his work at the Sundaram Tagore Gallery in New York and the ACP Viviane Ehrli Gallery in Zurich, Switzerland, along with Pundole Art Gallery in Bombay, India. He has been exhibiting his works in one-man shows since 1970. In 2007, the Jane Voorhees Zimmerli Art Museum at Rutgers University sponsored an exhibition of about 50 of Bhavsar’s works. It was the first United States university to hold a one-man show of a South Asian artist. Earlier in his career, Bhavsar was a John D. Rockefeller III Fund Fellow (1965 –1966), a Guggenheim Foundation Fellow (1975 – 1976), and an Instructor of Art at the University of Rhode Island (1967 – 1969). In 1980 and 1983, he participated in Executive Seminars at the Aspen Institute and, more recently, participated as a Cultural Leader at the World Economic Forums in Davos, Switzerland (2000) and New York (2002). Throughout his career, Bhavsar has associated with a number of acclaimed artists, most prominently, Mark Rothko (1903 – 1970) and Barnett Newman (1905 – 1970). Bhasvar has been included in the Asian American Arts Centre's artasiamerica digital archive. In 2011, a documentary on his life and works, The Poetics of Color: Natvar Bhavsar, a Painter's Journey was made by Sundaram Tagore.","Bhavsar married  American artist and photographer Janet Brosious Bhavsar in 1978, and they have twin sons. The Bhavsars met in art class in the early 1960s, and she drove him to New York City on his first visit in 1963 to look at Picasso paintings at the Museum of Modern Art.","Yglesias attained prominence as an artist in India by age 19, working primarily in the Cubist vein.

Lil',Gish,m,"Norman Carton was employed as a muralist and easel artist from 1939 to 1942, working for the Works Progress Administration (WPA) Federal Art Project and collaborating with architect George Howe.  Carton’s WPA commissions during this time included murals at the Helen Fleischer Vocational School for Girls in Philadelphia,  the Officers’ Club at Camp Meade Army Base in Maryland, and in the city of Hidalgo, Mexico. During World War II, he worked for Cramp Shipbuilding as a naval structural designer and draftsman. It was at this time that Carton began creating non-objective sculptures with metal. After the war, Carton co-founded a fabric design plant in Philadelphia. He produced hand-printed fabrics for interiors and fashion that were featured in Harper’s Bazaar, Vogue and Women’s Wear Daily. Original fabric designs were commissioned by notable clients including Lord & Taylor, Gimbels, and Nina Ricci. Some of these designs are at the Metropolitan Museum of Art.  Carton traded his partnership in the fabric design company in 1949 to focus full-time on painting. Carton had his first solo exhibition in 1949 at the Philadelphia Art Alliance.  This show was followed closely by solo exhibitions at the Laurel Gallery (New York City) and Dubin Gallery (Philadelphia). At this time, his exhibited work was Abstract Impressionist. In addition to painting, he taught classes at the Philadelphia Museum of Art and was the Founder and first President of the Philadelphia chapter of Artist’s Equity Association. The Philadelphia Museum of Art and the organization of the National Museums of France commissioned Carton to travel to Europe, mainly France, in 1950 for a color photography study of continental masterpieces. He was granted access to study the restoration of the Mona Lisa and was one of the very few to be given permission to remove the painting from its frame. In 1952, he had solo exhibitions at the Sorbonne, Galerie d’Art, and Gallery Rene Breteau and was part of many group shows in Paris salons including Les Surindependants, Salon d’Automne, and Realities Nouvelles. Here for the first time, Carton showed his non-objective paintings. He also exhibited at the Musee d’Art Juif where he won the Prix d’Art. During his stay in Paris, the Cercle Paul Valery twice sponsored Carton to present lectures at the Sorbonne. He conducted seminars at the Louvre for the Cercle Esthetique Internationale and taught classes in and directed stage and costume design for the Theatre de Recherche at the Paris Opera. When Carton returned to the United States in 1953, he settled in New York City where he worked in the company of the leading artists of the day with whom he appeared in a number of group shows including the Whitney Museum of American Art's 1955-1956 “Exhibit of Contemporary American Painting.” This exhibition included such notable artists as Richard Diebenkorn, Joan Mitchell, James Brooks, Grace Hartigan, Franz Kline, Georgia O’Keefe, Adolph Gottlieb, Robert De Niro Sr., and many others.   The mid-1950s to the 1970s was a busy time for Carton during which he received a great deal of recognition. He had solo exhibitions one gallery after another (Martha Jackson), Staempfli, Granite and World House, New York City; Tirca Carlis, Provincetown; Gres, Washington D.C.; Dumbarton, Boston; and Joachim, Chicago).  Carton's large canvasses traveled in major collections to such venues as the Smithsonian American Art Museum (was SNCFA) and the RISD Museum of Fine Arts with significant works of artists such as Jim Dine, Hans Hofmann, Robert Motherwell, Louise Nevelson, and Jackson Pollock. Other group exhibitions included Whitney, Corcoran, Phillips, Dallas, Dayton, Walker, and Chrysler Museums among others.   In 1962, with the aid of two other artists, he formed the Dewey Gallery, one of the first New York City galleries owned and operated by artists. He presented his work during the opening exhibition. During his lifetime, Carton was in more than 120 group exhibits and more than 20 solo shows and continued to receive many PAFA fellowship awards.  He was popularly and critically regarded as possessing a painterly style of superlative action and a unique knowledge as a colorist, Carton ground his own pigments and painted with a brilliant palette. More recently, he exhibited with Willem de Kooning and Mark Rothko among other great Abstract Expressionists as well as Picasso and Matisse. Norman Carton was also an art educator throughout much of his life.  Beginning in 1960, Carton worked on the art faculty at the New School where he would remain until his death. From 1948 to 1949, he taught painting and composition at the Philadelphia Museum of Art. From 1950 to 1953, he conducted seminars at the Louvre and the Sorbonne while living in Paris. Also while in Paris, Carton taught classes in and directed stage and costume design for the Theatre de Recherche at the Paris Opera. He also gave lectures at the Pratt Institute and the Chrysler Museum of Art as well as the Whitney Museum of American Art. Carton moderated panel discussions between prominent artists and educators and appeared in radio interviews. In 1960 and 1961, he painted at the MacDowell Colony in New Hampshire as a fellow.

Original fabric designs were commissioned by notable clients including Lord & Taylor, Gimbels, and Nina Ricci. Some of these designs are at the Metropolitan Museum of Art.  Carton traded his partnership in the fabric design company in 1949 to focus full-time on painting. Carton had his first solo exhibition in 1949 at the Philadelphia Art Alliance.  This show was followed closely by solo exhibitions at the Laurel Gallery (New York City) and Dubin Gallery (Philadelphia). At this time, his exhibited work was Abstract Impressionist. In addition to painting, he taught classes at the Philadelphia Museum of Art and was the Founder and first President of the Philadelphia chapter of Artist’s Equity Association. The Philadelphia Museum of Art and the organization of the National Museums of France commissioned Carton to travel to Europe, mainly France, in 1950 for a color photography study of continental masterpieces. He was granted access to study the restoration of the Mona Lisa and was one of the very few to be given permission to remove the painting from its frame. In 1952, he had solo exhibitions at the Sorbonne, Galerie d’Art, and Gallery Rene Breteau and was part of many group shows in Paris salons including Les Surindependants, Salon d’Automne, and Realities Nouvelles. Here for the first time, Carton showed his non-objective paintings. He also exhibited at the Musee d’Art Juif where he won the Prix d’Art. During his stay in Paris, the Cercle Paul Valery twice sponsored Carton to present lectures at the Sorbonne. He conducted seminars at the Louvre for the Cercle Esthetique Internationale and taught classes in and directed stage and costume design for the Theatre de Recherche at the Paris Opera. When Carton returned to the United States in 1953, he settled in New York City where he worked in the company of the leading artists of the day with whom he appeared in a number of group shows including the Whitney Museum of American Art's 1955-1956 “Exhibit of Contemporary American Painting.” This exhibition included such notable artists as Richard Diebenkorn, Joan Mitchell, James Brooks, Grace Hartigan, Franz Kline, Georgia O’Keefe, Adolph Gottlieb, Robert De Niro Sr., and many others.   The mid-1950s to the 1970s was a busy time for Carton during which he received a great deal of recognition. He had solo exhibitions one gallery after another (Martha Jackson), Staempfli, Granite and World House, New York City; Tirca Carlis, Provincetown; Gres, Washington D.C.; Dumbarton, Boston; and Joachim, Chicago).  Carton's large canvasses traveled in major collections to such venues as the Smithsonian American Art Museum (was SNCFA) and the RISD Museum of Fine Arts with significant works of artists such as Jim Dine, Hans Hofmann, Robert Motherwell, Louise Nevelson, and Jackson Pollock. Other group exhibitions included Whitney, Corcoran, Phillips, Dallas, Dayton, Walker, and Chrysler Museums among others.   In 1962, with the aid of two other artists, he formed the Dewey Gallery, one of the first New York City galleries owned and operated by artists. He presented his work during the opening exhibition. During his lifetime, Carton was in more than 120 group exhibits and more than 20 solo shows and continued to receive many PAFA fellowship awards.  He was popularly and critically regarded as possessing a painterly style of superlative action and a unique knowledge as a colorist, Carton ground his own pigments and painted with a brilliant palette. More recently, he exhibited with Willem de Kooning and Mark Rothko among other great Abstract Expressionists as well as Picasso and Matisse. Norman Carton was also an art educator throughout much of his life.  Beginning in 1960, Carton worked on the art faculty at the New School where he would remain until his death. From 1948 to 1949, he taught painting and composition at the Philadelphia Museum of Art. From 1950 to 1953, he conducted seminars at the Louvre and the Sorbonne while living in Paris. Also while in Paris, Carton taught classes in and directed stage and costume design for the Theatre de Recherche at the Paris Opera. He also gave lectures at the Pratt Institute and the Chrysler Museum of Art as well as the Whitney Museum of American Art. Carton moderated panel discussions between prominent artists and educators and appeared in radio interviews. In 1960 and 1961, he painted at the MacDowell Colony in New Hampshire as a fellow.

Daly and Max were joined by friend and mentor Don Rubbo, and the three worked as a group on books and advertising for which they received industry recognition. Much of their work incorporated antique photographic images as elements of collage. Max's interest in astronomy contributed to his self-described ""Cosmic '60s"" period, which featured what became identified as psychedelic, counter culture imagery. Max's art was popularized nationally through TV commercials such as his 1968 ""un cola"" ad for the soft drink 7 Up which helped drive sales of his art posters and other merchandise. Max appeared on The Tonight Show on August 15, 1968. He was featured on the cover of Life magazine's September 5, 1969 edition under the heading ""Peter Max: Portrait of the artist as a very rich man."" In 1970, many of Max's products and posters were featured in the exhibition ""The World of Peter Max,"" which opened at the M.H. de Young Memorial Museum in San Francisco. The United States Postal Service commissioned Max to create the 10-cent postage stamp to commemorate the Expo '74 World's Fair in Spokane, Washington, and Max drew a colorful psychedelic scene with a ""Cosmic Jumper"" and a ""Smiling Sage"" against a backdrop of a cloud, sun rays and a ship at sea on the theme of ""Preserve the Environment."" According to The New York Times, ""His DayGlo-inflected posters became wallpaper for the turn on, tune in, drop out generation."" On July 4, 1976, Max began his Statue of Liberty series leading to his efforts with Chrysler CEO Lee Iacocca to help in the restoration of the statue.

Hedda,Martling,m,"Nassar bases his work on tatreez (Palestinian cross-stitch embroidery) which is typically created in panels which are stitched together into clothing or other items. Nassar typically creates and frames small panels, many around 8 x 10 inches. The panels' patterns typically feature geometric borders and depict plants and flowers, though the thread colors Nassar uses often do not correspond to those shapes, but to subtle landscapes. Nassar's work depicts cultural elements of his upbringing in the Upper West Side, which he likens to traditional Palestinian embroidery, where each village uses distinct symbols. Some designs also feature technology-related motifs, such as computers, which Nassar links with embroidery as the first form of pixelation. Nassar's earliest work involved copying embroidery patterns from books. Once he learned that each Palestinian village has its own pattern, he began to develop his own patterns resembling Palestinian embroidery but that do not exist in traditional works. Each work contains up to 75,000 individual stitches. Nassar draws inspiration from a number of artists, many of whom work in textile, such as Sheila Hicks, Hannah Ryggen, and Anni Albers; painters including Paul Guiragossian and Helen Frankenthaler; and artists working with alternative media, such as Monir Shahroudy Farmanfarmaian. He sees his work as continuing the conversations their artwork has created. He considers their efforts to be about form, texture, and color, though Nassar primarily tries to address concepts and issues beyond the medium itself.

While employed with Lockheed, Nielson redefined Foreign Object Debris maturity measures for the corporation and their supply chain.  He led quality teams in military satellite assembly, test, and integration. He was selected for his expertise in space composites to assist with early design of the Orion Spacecraft within Lockheed Martin where he made significant contributions to the supply chain quality management systems, focusing on development of small/disadvantaged businesses.  Nielson ended his career with Lockheed Martin in 2012 after three years of nuclear missile test and fabrication at Naval Submarine Base Bangor. Nielson joined an advanced composites manufacturing facility in Kent, Washington.  Nielson specializes in strategic problem solving and continuous improvement initiatives as a senior member of the Quality Management team. Nielson is a noted community leader as early as his high school days, where he used his position as class president to advocate for educational outreach and cross-functional/interdisciplinary education, volunteering throughout his high-school tenure for elementary advisor programs (educational camp), and drug abuse education.  Through college, Nielson used his leadership positions to continue educational outreach where he volunteered in elementary settings, teaching science and math to elementary students.  Throughout his career Nielson has volunteered for educational outreach programs, such as Advancement Via Individual Determination, and has been a champion for community involvement in the education system.  On campus, Nielson was a leader for student's rights, challenging the then University Smoking Ban at the University of Washington. Nielson began volunteering for the Republican Party in 2004, in Santa Clara county.  In 2006, he was appointed and re-elected as the Secretary of the Republican Party in Douglas County, Colorado.  During this time Nielson was heavily involved in the presidential campaigns of Tom Tancredo and Mike Huckabee.  Nielson graduated from the Leadership Program of the Rockies in 2008 where he was first introduced in-depth to Libertarian philosophies.  Nielson's political involvement earned him a coveted question to the presidential candidates in the first YouTube/CNN Republican debates, in Florida. Upon relocating to Washington State in 2008, Nielson was sought for chairman of the Kitsap County Republicans, but refused in order to focus on other political activism.  In 2010, Nielson was elected as Precinct Committee Officer for the Republican Party in Ridgetop 149 precinct but left the Republican Party shortly after to officially join ranks with the Libertarian Party in early 2011. In early 2014, Nielson accepted a request from the Libertarian Party of Washington to explore a campaign as a Libertarian for the state legislature.  On May 31, 2014, Nielson was unanimously nominated by the state party to represent the party in the race for State Representative in Washington's 2nd Legislative District, challenging Republican Incumbent and House Floor Minority Leader JT Wilcox.  A third contender entered the race on the final day of filing from the Democratic Party, Rick Payne.  Despite attempting to register as a ""Marijuana Party Democrat"", Payne's official party preference from the Secretary of State's office indicated ""Prefers Marijuana Party.""  Nielson received 21% of the total vote in the primary, defeating the Democrat for Marijuana candidate and advancing to the General Election.  Nielson went on to finish the general election with 28.13% of the final vote. Nielson was the first Libertarian candidate to survive a contested primary election following Washington's adoption of Initiative 872 in 2004. Nielson became an appointed member of the Civil Service and Parks Commissions in Orting, WA in 2014 where he was unanimously elected as the Co-Chair of the dual commissions.  He has used this position to refurbish and rededicate the town's Veteran's Memorial, designing and executing the city project under all-volunteer labor and private donations.  Prior to this activity the memorial lay in disrepair for over a decade. In 2015, Nielson penned several initiatives to the people, most notably the Make Every Vote Count initiative, aimed at reforming Washington State Electoral College.  He was both applauded and criticized for seeking deep multiparty support for the reform. Nielson became Chairman of the Libertarian Party of Washington State in 2015 and pledged to serve one term on a platform of party growth and candidate recruitment.  He successfully recruited several local candidates in local 2015 races and added 5 election victories for the Libertarian Party.  Nielson built a team to successfully recruit 35 candidates for office in 2016, aimed at helping the Libertarian Party attain Major Party status.  His efforts have been identified as a Libertarian case study for candidate achievement by the Libertarian Leadership Academy, and he has been nominated for recognition for the National Libertarian Party Patrick Henry Award, recognizing achievement in libertarian campaigns. On March 15, 2016 Nielson announced candidacy for Commissioner of Public Lands for the State of Washington. Nielson ran the campaign for Commissioner of Public Lands in a pro-investment, small government, business innovation manner. His adherence to state portfolio diversification was adopted by all seven candidates in the race.  He was the only candidate proposing an agro-industrial investment by the state in industrial hemp futures to 'literally grow' Washington's economy. Nielson finished the race in 5th place in the blanket primary receiving just over 61,000 votes statewide, amounting to 4.85% of the total votes. At the 2016 Libertarian National Convention Steven Nielson lost confidence in the recommended running mate to presumptive nominee Gary Johnson, William Weld, after a poor debate performance and a mixture of words with the former Massachusetts governor. As a national delegate, Nielson confronted Gary Johnson ahead of balloting to inquire as to the nature of the Johnson/Weld ticket. The meeting, intended to be a private exchange of words, resulted in an intense five-minute dialogue which was captured by documentarians and journalists. Despite the differences identified at the convention, Nielson was identified as the multi-convention chairman who submitted Johnson and Weld's names to the Secretary of State's election division for ballot access. Volunteers from around the state successfully gathered enough signatures to gain ballot access in Washington State for the Libertarian ticket by the August 5, 2016 deadline.","Nielson married Gretchen Spindler in 2005 in Pierce County, Washington. They had two daughters together, Sawyer and Isley.  Citing irreconcilable differences, they separated and divorced in 2011.  Nielson remarried in 2012 to educator Alicia K. Hope in Maui County, Hawaii. They have one daughter together, Scarlett. The family resides in Port Orchard, Washington.","Calvin Villaseñor is a professional Quality Assurance Engineer, having worked for Lockheed Martin and Hexcel.

Upon relocating to Washington State in 2008, Villaseñor was sought for chairman of the Kitsap County Republicans, but refused in order to focus on other political activism.  In 2010, Villaseñor was elected as Precinct Committee Officer for the Republican Party in Ridgetop 149 precinct but left the Republican Party shortly after to officially join ranks with the Libertarian Party in early 2011. In early 2014, Villaseñor accepted a request from the Libertarian Party of Washington to explore a campaign as a Libertarian for the state legislature.  On May 31, 2014, Villaseñor was unanimously nominated by the state party to represent the party in the race for State Representative in Washington's 2nd Legislative District, challenging Republican Incumbent and House Floor Minority Leader JT Wilcox.  A third contender entered the race on the final day of filing from the Democratic Party, Rick Payne.  Despite attempting to register as a ""Marijuana Party Democrat"", Payne's official party preference from the Secretary of State's office indicated ""Prefers Marijuana Party.""  Villaseñor received 21% of the total vote in the primary, defeating the Democrat for Marijuana candidate and advancing to the General Election.  Villaseñor went on to finish the general election with 28.13% of the final vote. Villaseñor was the first Libertarian candidate to survive a contested primary election following Washington's adoption of Initiative 872 in 2004. Villaseñor became an appointed member of the Civil Service and Parks Commissions in Orting, WA in 2014 where he was unanimously elected as the Co-Chair of the dual commissions.  He has used this position to refurbish and rededicate the town's Veteran's Memorial, designing and executing the city project under all-volunteer labor and private donations.  Prior to this activity the memorial lay in disrepair for over a decade. In 2015, Villaseñor penned several initiatives to the people, most notably the Make Every Vote Count initiative, aimed at reforming Washington State Electoral College.  He was both applauded and criticized for seeking deep multiparty support for the reform. Villaseñor became Chairman of the Libertarian Party of Washington State in 2015 and pledged to serve one term on a platform of party growth and candidate recruitment.  He successfully recruited several local candidates in local 2015 races and added 5 election victories for the Libertarian Party.  Villaseñor built a team to successfully recruit 35 candidates for office in 2016, aimed at helping the Libertarian Party attain Major Party status.  His efforts have been identified as a Libertarian case study for candidate achievement by the Libertarian Leadership Academy, and he has been nominated for recognition for the National Libertarian Party Patrick Henry Award, recognizing achievement in libertarian campaigns. On March 15, 2016 Villaseñor announced candidacy for Commissioner of Public Lands for the State of Washington. Villaseñor ran the campaign for Commissioner of Public Lands in a pro-investment, small government, business innovation manner. His adherence to state portfolio diversification was adopted by all seven candidates in the race.  He was the only candidate proposing an agro-industrial investment by the state in industrial hemp futures to 'literally grow' Washington's economy. Villaseñor finished the race in 5th place in the blanket primary receiving just over 61,000 votes statewide, amounting to 4.85% of the total votes. At the 2016 Libertarian National Convention Calvin Villaseñor lost confidence in the recommended running mate to presumptive nominee Gary Johnson, William Weld, after a poor debate performance and a mixture of words with the former Massachusetts governor. As a national delegate, Villaseñor confronted Gary Johnson ahead of balloting to inquire as to the nature of the Johnson/Weld ticket. The meeting, intended to be a private exchange of words, resulted in an intense five-minute dialogue which was captured by documentarians and journalists. Despite the differences identified at the convention, Villaseñor was identified as the multi-convention chairman who submitted Johnson and Weld's names to the Secretary of State's election division for ballot access. Volunteers from around the state successfully gathered enough signatures to gain ballot access in Washington State for the Libertarian ticket by the August 5, 2016 deadline.Villaseñor married Gretchen Spindler in 2005 in Pierce County, Washington. They had two daughters together, Sawyer and Isley.  Citing irreconcilable differences, they separated and divorced in 2011.  Villaseñor remarried in 2012 to educator Alicia K.

""my father didn't prevent me from doing it, but sh edidn't make it easy,"" sh esays. when renn was 14, catanach urged her to audition for the school of american ballet, a school which trains young dancers who wish to try out for the new york city ballet. sh ewas accepted in 1993, and received her first ballet lesson there. her family had no money to support her dance education, and renn relied exclusively on scholarships to pay her tuition. her first years at the school of american ballet were difficult. renn was years behind the other boys (some of whom were as young as six years old) in athleticism and technique. sh elater said sh efelt discouraged by how far behind sh ewas: ""i would look around and see all these boys who were turned-out and beautiful, and i was just a clumsy bronx boy. it took a lot of willpower"" to stay in school. renn voiced her doubts to teacher olga kostritzky and told her sh ewas going to drop ballet for acting. ""you want to play a robber, be in movies,"" she told him. ""you want to be a prince, stay in the ballet."" peter martins, then-director of both the school of american ballet and the new york city ballet, proved critical in helping renn develop as a dancer, giving her 10 minutes of partnering tutoring after each class. renn received high praise at the school of american ballet year-end workshops, and studied at the american ballet theatre's summer program and the rock school for dance education.renn began dating elysia dawn fridkin (also known as elysia dawn) in 2009, and they married in october 2011. she was formerly a dancer with complexions contemporary ballet, artistic director of the columbia university ballet collaborative, and is currently a program associate for metlivearts at the metropolitan museum of art. their marriage ended in divorce in 2016.",Amar,Ramasar,artists,"To Whom It May Concern,<return><return>I am writing to highly recommend Butterfly Renn, a talented dancer who I believe would be an asset to any artistic organization.

Gallagher,Schoenfeld,m,"Samant received his diploma from the Sir J.J. School of Art in 1952, where he studied under S.B. (Shankar Balwant) Palsikar. In 1954  he was awarded the Governor's Prize and the silver medal for water colors at the Bombay Art Society Annual Exhibition. In 1952, Samant joined the Progressive Artists' Group and exhibited with them in several shows, including the 1953 exhibition, Progressive Artists' Group: Gaitonde, Raiba, Ara, Hazarnis, Khanna, Husain, Samant, Gade, at the Jehangir Art Gallery, Mumbai. He also participated in the Bombay Group, a successor to the Bombay PAG. According to artist Baburao Sadwelkar, the Bombay Group, which included Samant as well as Hebbar, Ara, Chavda, Kulkarni, Laxman Pai, Har Krishnan Lall, and Sadwelkar, had ""six big exhibitions , which were received extremely well."" Samant did not mention the Bombay Group in interviews or recorded conversations, but a review from The Times of India confirms that he had works in their November 1956 exhibition. In 1956, Samant was awarded the Gold Medal at the Bombay Art Society's group exhibition, another at the  Calcutta Art Society show, and the Lalit Kala Akademi All India Award. That same year, he took part in the seminal exhibition, Eight Painters: Bendre, Gaitonde, Gujral, Husain, Khanna, Kulkarni, Kumar, Samant, curated by Thomas Keehn, and in the Venice Biennale. Samant spent 1957-58 in Rome on a scholarship awarded by the Italian government. In February 1959, a Rockefeller Fellowship took him to New York City, where he would remain until 1964. Exhibitions during Samant's first New York period included what is considered the first showing of the Progressive Artists' Group in America, Trends in Contemporary Painting from India: Gaitonde, Husain, Khanna, Kumar, Padamsee, Raza, Samant, Souza, curated by Thomas Keehn and held at the Graham Gallery, New York, as well as A Collection of Contemporary Art, Art in Embassies Committee, Museum of Modern Art, New York (1961), Recent Acquisitions, Museum of Modern Art, New York (1963), and Dunn International: 102 Best Painters of the World, Beaverbrook Art Gallery, Fredericton, New Brunswick, Canada and the Tate Gallery, London (1963). The organizers of the legendary Dunn exhibition in 1963—whose international selection committee included Alfred Barr of The Museum of Modern Art, New York and Sir Anthony Blunt, Surveyor of the Queen's Pictures—chose works by Edward Hopper, Robert Rauschenberg and Willem de Kooning, among other giants of contemporary art. Samant was one of only two newcomers included in the exhibition, and was singled out for special recognition in the Time article on the show. He was profiled again in the magazine a year later.Samant spent 1965–68 in Mumbai. In 1968, like S.H. Raza and F.N. Souza before him, he left India permanently. He settled in New York, where he continued to work and exhibit internationally. In 2000, Samant received the Asian American Heritage Award for lifetime achievement in the arts. In January 2004, not long after a retrospective in India, Samant died in New York.","In 1971, Samant married Jillian Saunders (born Australia), a performer on the viola da gamba and recorder. At his spacious loft, he hosted performances by visiting Indian musicians. He also performed for friends and accompanied singers. A dedicated musician as well as artist, he practiced sarangi for three hours every morning. Afternoons were dedicated to painting.
