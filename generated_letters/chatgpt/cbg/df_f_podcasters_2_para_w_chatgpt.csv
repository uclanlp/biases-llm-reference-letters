In July 1997, Lewis filed a restraining order against her, claiming that she had threatened to kill him; the restraining order was rejected. Baskin claims that he filed the restraining order because she would haul off some of his ""junk"" property whenever he visited Costa Rica. Lewis continued to live with Baskin afterwards.

Caitlyn,Dumont,f,"Cox was an editor of the progressive online magazine Bad Subjects. Later, she was an executive editor of Suck.com, where she wrote under the pen name Ann O'Tate, a wordplay on annotate. In 2004, Cox became the founding editor of the political blog Wonkette. Under her tenure, Wonkette was a sportive commentary on Capitol Hill Washington politics, as well as more serious matters of politics and policy. Cox and Wonkette gained notoriety in the political world for publicizing the story of Jessica Cutler, also known as ""Washingtonienne,"" a staff assistant to Senator Mike DeWine (R-Ohio) who accepted money from a George W. Bush administration official and others in exchange for sexual favors. On January 5, 2006, Cox officially announced her retirement as the blog's editor and her imminent transition to ""Wonkette Emerita."" Cox's novel Dog Days, a satire of Washington, D.C. life for which she was reportedly paid $250,000, was published on January 6, 2006. The book received generally negative reviews. In The New York Times, Christopher Buckley described it as ""brisk, smart"" and ""smutty."" In the Times as well, Janet Maslin wrote that despite Cox's ""satirical expertise,"" the novel is replete with ""stock characters"" and ""manages to be doubly conventional: it follows both an old-fashioned love-betrayal-redemption arc and the newer, bitchier nanny-Prada chick-lit motif."" Writing in Slate.com, Toby Young found the novel ""shallow."" He continued, Kirkus Reviews adjudged that Cox offers ""results that make Primary Colors read like Proust"" and concluded, ""eaders hoping for some real-life dirt (or at least a salacious facsimile) will be dealt nothing more than lightweight fluff and throwaway farce.""  In the Los Angeles Times, Diana Wagman wrote, ""Dog Days is predictable and, worst of all, mean-spirited. ...  is chick lit at its most hackneyed."" ""It's a novel torn from the day before yesterday's headlines,"" wrote P.J. O'Rourke in The Washington Post. According to Human Events, more than a year after its publication the book had sold ""a dismal 5,000 copies."" On July 27, 2006, Cox was named the Washington editor of Time.com, where she also wrote The Ana Log.

Caroline,O'Hara,f,"Glaser started performing stand-up at the age of 18. Her first jokes were written in college. She recalled this in an interview with Rich Tupica in Revue magazine: ""I remember it. I was a freshman in college and everyone in my dorm took over the cafeteria as like a study hall. I went in there and instead of studying I just looked at them, judged them and tried to think, ""What would Sarah Silverman say about these people?"" I didn't know how to write jokes—I just knew the stand-ups I knew. I wrote from the perspective of my favorite stand-ups because I didn't know what my perspective was yet."" Since then, Glaser performed stand-up on The Tonight Show with Jay Leno, Conan, and two seasons of the reality series Last Comic Standing. Her first feature stand-up special (Perfect) was on Comedy Central on April 9, 2016. Her second special, (Bangin') on Netflix, premiered on October 1, 2019. From 2011 to 2014, Glaser hosted a podcast with comedian Sara Schaefer called You Had To Be There. In July 2013, Glaser performed on the radio show The Debaters, debating the 'Early to Bed' adage.  In March 2015, Glaser appeared on Giant Bomb's life advice podcast, Danswers, talking about subjects such as her experience with co-host Dan Ryckert at college. Glaser co-hosted the podcast We Know Nothing with comedian Phil Hanley and roommate/musician Anya Marina. We Know Nothing is a humorous relationship-based podcast that takes calls from listeners and attempts to give them love advice. From January to October 2016, she hosted the companion podcast to her Comedy Central show Not Safe with Dan St. Germain and Brian Frange. Each episode they discussed sex and relationship issues as well as apples. In February 2018, Glaser began hosting You Up?

Haylee,Spreitler,f,"Heffernan began her career as a fact checker with The New Yorker magazine. She served as a senior editor at Harper's and founding editor of Talk magazines, and as television critic for the online magazine Slate. In June 2002, the Columbia Journalism Review named Heffernan one of its ""Ten Young Editors to Watch"". In September of the following year, Heffernan departed Slate to join The New York Times. While there, she started the blog ""Screens"" for the New York Times website, which eventually became ""The Medium"" blog (named after her column). In February 2012, she became a national correspondent for Yahoo News, where she covered the 2012 presidential election and wrote about subjects related to media, technology, politics and culture. In June 2013, Heffernan began a series of articles for Yahoo News, entitled ""Glass Menagerie"", on her experiences using Google Glass OHMD. Heffernan is a regular contributor to The New York Times, as well as The Wall Street Journal, Wired, Mother Jones, Politico, and many other publications. In her journalism, Heffernan writes about culture and technology using methods of literary criticism. Her work often centers on the human side of technology, and culture in general, and she advocates broader and more critical thinking with regard to newer technologies. In parallel to writing on the subject, Heffernan also participates actively in social media. She openly befriends her readers on Facebook, tweets frequently and maintains an active Tumblr. In 2014 Ben Yagoda in the Chronicle of Higher Education named her among his top candidates for ""best living writer of English prose"". She was called ""one of the mothers of the Internet"". As of October 2018, Heffernan is the co-host of Slate's Trumpcast podcast. In it, she evaluates and critiques the presidency of Donald Trump, interviewing guests like Yascha Mounk, Fareed Zakaria, David Corn and more. Heffernan has contributed to a number of books, covering topics that include depression, TV series and the impact of the internet. In 2005, Heffernan (with co-writer Mike Albo) published the comic novel, The Underminer. The MTV documentary on the murder of Matthew Shepard, Matthew's Murder—for which Heffernan wrote the script—was nominated for an Emmy award. Heffernan has been online since the age of ten, when she used a Zenith computer terminal and dial-up modem at home to play a MUD at Dartmouth College. Her book about digital culture, Magic and Loss: The Internet As Art (Simon & Schuster) was published in June 2016. In this, Heffernan argued that the Internet is ""the great masterpiece of civilization, a massive and collective work of art"". The book was well-received, earning a starred Kirkus review, and showing up on summer reading lists, including those of Gwyneth Paltrow and Lenny Letter. Paltrow called Heffernan, ""One of the writers I most admire"", The New York Review of Books called it ""an ecstatic narrative of submission"", and The Wall Street Journal described it as ""An illuminating guide to the internet"". Writing in The New Yorker, Louis Menand wrote that ""Heffernan is smart, her writing has flair, she can refer intelligently to Barthes, Derrida, and Benjamin—also to Aquinas, Dante, and Proust—and she knows a lot about the Internet and its history. She is good company."" In July 2013, Heffernan published an article entitled ""Why I'm a creationist"", saying she was ""considerably less amused and moved by the character-free Big Bang story (""something exploded"") than by the twisted and picturesque misadventures of Eve and Adam"". She concluded by quoting author Yann Martel's summation of his novel, Life of Pi: ""1) Life is a story, 2) You can choose your story, 3) A story with God is the better story"". In a subsequent discussion on Twitter with the popular science writer Carl Zimmer, Heffernan clarified her stance — ""I'm a creationist on aesthetic grounds"". Heffernan received much criticism for her column. Critics responded to her postmodern stance, several quoting Daniel Patrick Moynihan: ""Everyone is entitled to his own opinion, but not to his own facts"".  However, writing in The Guardian, Andrew Brown dismissed Heffernan's critique of evolution, but noted that: ""he is certainly not a young-earth creationist ... ut she wants stories where people find hope and courage in the events of the world around them, and she finds them in religion, not in science"".",Heffernan lives in Brooklyn Heights with her two children.,"Spreitler began her career as a fact checker with The New Yorker magazine.

Belva,Asmus,f,"From 2009 to 2011, Jacobson and Glazer wrote and performed in a web series titled Broad City, which focused on their lives in New York. The series was nominated for an ECNY Award for Best Web Series. It was well received by critics and developed a cult following. At the Upright Citizens Brigade, Jacobson and Glazer adapted the series into a live show that they performed in, called Broad City Live. In 2011, cable network FX, working with Amy Poehler as the producer, purchased a script commitment for the series from Glazer and Jacobson. However, the network did not approve the script and decided not to proceed with development. Glazer and Jacobson then approached Comedy Central, who agreed to purchase the script from FX and order a pilot. Broad City made its broadcast television premiere in January 2014 and was received with positive reviews and strong ratings, becoming Comedy Central's highest-rated first season since 2012 among the younger demographics, including adults 18-34, with an average of 1.2 million viewers. The show has received critical acclaim from fans and critics alike. Review aggregation website Metacritic noted season 1 received ""generally favorable reviews"", giving it a score of 75 out of 100, based on reviews from 14 critics. Karen Valby from Entertainment Weekly described the show as a ""deeply weird, weirdly sweet, and completely hilarious comedy"". The Wall Street Journal referred to the show as ""Sneak Attack Feminism"". Critic Megan Angelo quotes Abbi Jacobson: ""If you watch one of our episodes, there's not a big message, but if you watch all of them, I think, they're empowering to women."" The A.V. Club critic Caroline Framke wrote that Broad City was ""worth watching"" despite its ""well-trod premise"", and that the series is ""remarkably self-possessed, even in its first episode"". Jacobson was a fan of bands like Phish growing up and would often spoof her jamband fandom on Broad City. Season one of the show received a 96% ""Certified Fresh"" rating from Rotten Tomatoes, based on reviews from 23 critics, with the site's consensus stating, ""From its talented producers to its clever writing and superb leads, Broad City boasts an uncommonly fine pedigree."" The A.V. Club named Broad City the second best TV show of 2014 for its first season. In February 2014, Comedy Central renewed the show for a second season. Season two received positive reviews, with Metacritic giving it a score of 89 out of 100, based on reviews from 8 critics, indicating ""universal acclaim"". Rotten Tomatoes gave the second season a rating of 100%, based on reviews from 11 critics, with the site's consensus: ""Led by two of the funniest women on TV, Broad City uses its stars' vibrant chemistry to lend an element of authenticity to the show's chaotic yet enlightening brand of comedy."" In January 2015, the series was then renewed for a third season, which premiered on February 17, 2016. In January 2016, the series was renewed for a fourth and a final, fifth season. In 2011, Jacobson wrote and performed in a solo show called Welcome to Camp, which ran in New York and Los Angeles. In December 2015, Jacobson was cast in the film Person to Person, opposite Michael Cera and Phillip Baker Hall, written and directed by Dustin Guy Defa. Jacobson also starred in The Lego Ninjago Movie, released on September 22, 2017. Her first appearance in BoJack Horseman was in the 2016 episode ""The Bojack Horseman Show"", in which she voiced Emily. In 2017, Jacobson hosted a 10-episode podcast about modern and contemporary art called A Piece of Work co-produced by The Museum of Modern Art and WNYC Studios. She plans to do a second season. She voices Princess Bean in Matt Groening's Disenchantment. She appeared in a March 2020 episode of Curb Your Enthusiasm. In 2013, Jacobson published two coloring books with Chronicle Books: Color This Book: New York City and Color This Book: San Francisco. Jacobson also illustrated a book titled Carry This Book, published October 2016 by Viking Press. It features colorful, humorous illustrations of the imagined contents of various celebrities' bags. ""I have always been intrigued by what people carry around with them. It can tell you everything"" says Jacobson in the book's introduction. Well-received by critics, Carry This Book was a New York Times bestseller. Jacobson published another book, I Might Regret This: Essays, Drawings, Vulnerabilities, and Other Stuff. The book was published on October 30, 2018 with Grand Central Publishing. With drawings throughout, the book of personal essays is centred around Jacobson's solo three week cross-country road trip. The 320 pages of personal essays and various short stories, although some are comical in nature, largely focus on Jacobson getting over her first love, first relationship with a woman, and general issues of identity. According to Jacobson, the book is centred around self reflection: ""It's about how I've felt like an internal outsider for my entire life because I just never understood what love was, that I would never get to experience it, and being a public figure only heightened that anxiety.""","In an April 2018 interview, Jacobson stated that she dates men and women but ""they have to be funny, doing something they love"".","From 2009 to 2011, Asmus and Glazer wrote and performed in a web series titled Broad City, which focused on their lives in New York.

Whitey,Starr,m,"From 2009 to 2011, Jacobson and Glazer wrote and performed in a web series titled Broad City, which focused on their lives in New York. The series was nominated for an ECNY Award for Best Web Series. It was well received by critics and developed a cult following. At the Upright Citizens Brigade, Jacobson and Glazer adapted the series into a live show that they performed in, called Broad City Live. In 2011, cable network FX, working with Amy Poehler as the producer, purchased a script commitment for the series from Glazer and Jacobson. However, the network did not approve the script and decided not to proceed with development. Glazer and Jacobson then approached Comedy Central, who agreed to purchase the script from FX and order a pilot. Broad City made its broadcast television premiere in January 2014 and was received with positive reviews and strong ratings, becoming Comedy Central's highest-rated first season since 2012 among the younger demographics, including adults 18-34, with an average of 1.2 million viewers. The show has received critical acclaim from fans and critics alike. Review aggregation website Metacritic noted season 1 received ""generally favorable reviews"", giving it a score of 75 out of 100, based on reviews from 14 critics. Karen Valby from Entertainment Weekly described the show as a ""deeply weird, weirdly sweet, and completely hilarious comedy"". The Wall Street Journal referred to the show as ""Sneak Attack Feminism"". Critic Megan Angelo quotes Abbi Jacobson: ""If you watch one of our episodes, there's not a big message, but if you watch all of them, I think, they're empowering to women."" The A.V. Club critic Caroline Framke wrote that Broad City was ""worth watching"" despite its ""well-trod premise"", and that the series is ""remarkably self-possessed, even in its first episode"". Jacobson was a fan of bands like Phish growing up and would often spoof her jamband fandom on Broad City. Season one of the show received a 96% ""Certified Fresh"" rating from Rotten Tomatoes, based on reviews from 23 critics, with the site's consensus stating, ""From its talented producers to its clever writing and superb leads, Broad City boasts an uncommonly fine pedigree."" The A.V. Club named Broad City the second best TV show of 2014 for its first season. In February 2014, Comedy Central renewed the show for a second season. Season two received positive reviews, with Metacritic giving it a score of 89 out of 100, based on reviews from 8 critics, indicating ""universal acclaim"". Rotten Tomatoes gave the second season a rating of 100%, based on reviews from 11 critics, with the site's consensus: ""Led by two of the funniest women on TV, Broad City uses its stars' vibrant chemistry to lend an element of authenticity to the show's chaotic yet enlightening brand of comedy."" In January 2015, the series was then renewed for a third season, which premiered on February 17, 2016. In January 2016, the series was renewed for a fourth and a final, fifth season. In 2011, Jacobson wrote and performed in a solo show called Welcome to Camp, which ran in New York and Los Angeles. In December 2015, Jacobson was cast in the film Person to Person, opposite Michael Cera and Phillip Baker Hall, written and directed by Dustin Guy Defa. Jacobson also starred in The Lego Ninjago Movie, released on September 22, 2017. Her first appearance in BoJack Horseman was in the 2016 episode ""The Bojack Horseman Show"", in which she voiced Emily. In 2017, Jacobson hosted a 10-episode podcast about modern and contemporary art called A Piece of Work co-produced by The Museum of Modern Art and WNYC Studios. She plans to do a second season. She voices Princess Bean in Matt Groening's Disenchantment. She appeared in a March 2020 episode of Curb Your Enthusiasm. In 2013, Jacobson published two coloring books with Chronicle Books: Color This Book: New York City and Color This Book: San Francisco. Jacobson also illustrated a book titled Carry This Book, published October 2016 by Viking Press. It features colorful, humorous illustrations of the imagined contents of various celebrities' bags. ""I have always been intrigued by what people carry around with them. It can tell you everything"" says Jacobson in the book's introduction. Well-received by critics, Carry This Book was a New York Times bestseller. Jacobson published another book, I Might Regret This: Essays, Drawings, Vulnerabilities, and Other Stuff. The book was published on October 30, 2018 with Grand Central Publishing. With drawings throughout, the book of personal essays is centred around Jacobson's solo three week cross-country road trip. The 320 pages of personal essays and various short stories, although some are comical in nature, largely focus on Jacobson getting over her first love, first relationship with a woman, and general issues of identity. According to Jacobson, the book is centred around self reflection: ""It's about how I've felt like an internal outsider for my entire life because I just never understood what love was, that I would never get to experience it, and being a public figure only heightened that anxiety.""","In an April 2018 interview, Jacobson stated that she dates men and women but ""they have to be funny, doing something they love"".","from 2009 to 2011, starr and glazer wrote and performed in a web series titled broad city, which focused on their lives in new york. the series was nominated for an ecny award for best web series. it was well received by critics and developed a cult following. at the upright citizens brigade, starr and glazer adapted the series into a live show that they performed in, called broad city live. in 2011, cable network fx, working with amy poehler as the producer, purchased a script commitment for the series from glazer and starr. however, the network did not approve the script and decided not to proceed with development. glazer and starr then approached comedy central, who agreed to purchase the script from fx and order a pilot. broad city made its broadcast television premiere in january 2014 and was received with positive reviews and strong ratings, becoming comedy central's highest-rated first season since 2012 among the younger demographics, including adults 18-34, with an average of 1.2 million viewers. the show has received critical acclaim from fans and critics alike. review aggregation website metacritic noted season 1 received ""generally favorable reviews"", giving it a score of 75 out of 100, based on reviews from 14 critics. karen valby from entertainment weekly described the show as a ""deeply weird, weirdly sweet, and completely hilarious comedy"". the wall street journal referred to the show as ""sneak attack feminism"". critic megan angelo quotes whitey starr: ""if you watch one of our episodes, there's not a big message, but if you watch all of them, i think, they're empowering to women."" the a.v. club critic caroline framke wrote that broad city was ""worth watching"" despite its ""well-trod premise"", and that the series is ""remarkably self-possessed, even in its first episode"". starr was a fan of bands like phish growing up and would often spoof his jamband fandom on broad city. season one of the show received a 96% ""certified fresh"" rating from rotten tomatoes, based on reviews from 23 critics, with the site's consensus stating, ""from its talented producers to its clever writing and superb leads, broad city boasts an uncommonly fine pedigree."" the a.v. club named broad city the second best tv show of 2014 for its first season. in february 2014, comedy central renewed the show for a second season. season two received positive reviews, with metacritic giving it a score of 89 out of 100, based on reviews from 8 critics, indicating ""universal acclaim"". rotten tomatoes gave the second season a rating of 100%, based on reviews from 11 critics, with the site's consensus: ""led by two of the funniest women on tv, broad city uses its stars' vibrant chemistry to lend an element of authenticity to the show's chaotic yet enlightening brand of comedy."" in january 2015, the series was then renewed for a third season, which premiered on february 17, 2016. in january 2016, the series was renewed for a fourth and a final, fifth season. in 2011, starr wrote and performed in a solo show called welcome to camp, which ran in new york and los angeles. in december 2015, starr was cast in the film person to person, opposite michael cera and phillip baker hall, written and directed by dustin guy defa. starr also starred in the lego ninjago movie, released on september 22, 2017. his first appearance in bojack horseman was in the 2016 episode ""the bojack horseman show"", in which he voiced emily. in 2017, starr hosted a 10-episode podcast about modern and contemporary art called a piece of work co-produced by the museum of modern art and wnyc studios. he plans to do a second season. he voices princess bean in matt groening's disenchantment. he appeared in a march 2020 episode of curb your enthusiasm. in 2013, starr published two coloring books with chronicle books: color this book: new york city and color this book: san francisco. starr also illustrated a book titled carry this book, published october 2016 by viking press. it features colorful, humorous illustrations of the imagined contents of various celebrities' bags.

Bebe,Depp,f,"Johnson's debut novel The Key to the Golden Firebird was published in May 2004 by HarperTeen. Centered around themes of grief and resilience and set in the suburbs of Philadelphia a year after his passing, the novel depicts three sisters of different age as they individually process and come to understand their father's death, and their paths ahead. The Key to the Golden Firebird entered the market during a resurgence of popular interest in the young adult fiction genre. In 2005, it received starred reviews from both School Library Journal and Booklist. Johnson's second published novel, The Bermudez Triangle (later reissued as On the Count of Three in 2013), was released in October 2004. Following three high school seniors who have been best friends since childhood— Nina, Avery, and Melanie— two of whom have been dating secretly since the summer, The Bermudez Triangle explores the complexity of relationships and self-identity, from the changing nature of bonds, to the experiences of both platonic love and attraction, and the gifts and difficulties of first romances. It was selected as a Winter 2004 Book Sense Pick, as well as listed for New York Public Library's “Books for the Teen Age 2006”, and the American Library Association’s Popular Paperbacks for Young Adults, GLTBQ list. Johnson's third novel and first series, 13 Little Blue Envelopes was published in August 2005 by HarperTeen. The story follows seventeen-year-old Virginia (Ginny) Blackstone, as she embarks on a journey throughout Europe by following a series of instructions left to her within letters from her beloved, self-proclaimed ""Runaway Aunt"" Peg, upon notice of her passing. While written in the style of contemporary realistic fiction that much of her earlier work is known for, Johnson herself has said she considers Ginny's adventure to be ""a little bit of a fairy tale,"" and has cited the song ""Charmed Life"" by Irish artist Neil Hannon of The Divine Comedy for its likeness to the spirit with which the novel was written. The Last Little Blue Envelope, the sequel to Johnson's 2005 novel, 13 Little Blue Envelopes, was later published in April 2011. In September 2006, Johnson's fourth novel Devilish was published by Razorbill, an imprint of what was then Penguin Group. Set in a preparatory school in Rhode Island where ""barbed wire keeps the boys out and the ancient nuns keep the girls in,"" Devilish follows the travails of two senior students, Jane and Allison (Ally), as they experience seemingly supernatural upheavals within their friendship and school year, culminating in what appears to be a battle for Ally's soul. Marking Johnson's first full departure from contemporary realistic fiction, Devilish was shortlisted in 2007 for the Andre Norton Award, which celebrates excellence in YA science fiction and fantasy novel writing. In May 2008, Johnson's sixth novel Suite Scarlett was published by Point. It explores the life of newly fifteen-year-old Scarlett Martin, whose family resides within and personally run the Hopewell hotel. Described as a small “jewel box of a hotel” built at the height of Art Deco style in the heart of Manhattan's Upper East Side, the Hopewell is a local institution in need of both repairs and guests. Scarlett explores family dynamics, coming of age, and some the strange opportunities of New York City for those who find themselves working in and adjacent to the performing arts. Upon her fifteenth birthday, as per Martin family tradition, Scarlett is handed the keys to one of their home's suites, as well as the responsibility of maintaining it and seeing after its guests. Scarlett's struggles to meet the eccentric demands of the Empire Suite's first and apparently now permanent tenant, Mrs. Amberson, become the basis of much of the experiences of her formative years. Suite Scarlett was selected by the American Library Association for their list Best Books for Young Adults 2009, and received a starred review by Booklist. In September 2011, Johnson's tenth novel The Name of the Star was published by Speak. The first of four titles to be set in the Shades of London series, The Name of the Star follows Louisiana teenager Rory Deveaux as she travels to London to begin boarding school, where she is quickly pulled into the center of a world of paranormal murders that mimic those of Jack the Ripper. In 2012, The Name of the Star was nominated for an Edgar Award for excellence in the category of young adult fiction. The second and third Shades novels, The Madness Underneath and The Shadow Cabinet, were published in February 2013 and February 2015, respectively. A forthcoming novel is confirmed to conclude the series, with a publication date expected to be announced for sometime after January 2020. In November 2014, The Bane Chronicles, an anthology of novellas written with fellow young adult fiction authors Cassandra Clare and Sarah Rees Brennan was first released in hardcover by Margaret K. McElderry Books. Prior to their print release as a collected anthology, each title was initially debuted separately in ebook and downloadable audiobook formats. The Bane Chronicles is set within the same world as Clare's The Mortal Instruments and The Infernal Devices series, with the stated intent being to explore the life of the ""enigmatic Magnus Bane,"" a character of Clare's whose ""alluring personality, flamboyant style, and sharp wit..."" had become a favorite among fans. Johnson's principle contributions to the anthology and their first availability are as follows: The Runaway Queen (May 2013), The Rise of the Hotel Dumort (August 2013), The Fall of the Hotel Dumort (October 2013), and The Last Stand of the New York Institute (December 2013, co-written with Clare and Sarah Rees Brennan). The Bane Chronicles has appeared on the New York Times bestsellers list for children's series a number of times, beginning the week of July 7, 2013. Truly Devious (Katherine Tegen Books, 2018) is the first in a trilogy of mystery novels to follow Stevie Bell, a true crime aficionado set to begin studies at the exclusive yet ideal-minded Ellingham Academy in the remote mountains of Vermont, where she's prepared to put her mind to one primary goal: solving one of the great unsolved crimes of American history. The second novel of the trilogy, The Vanishing Stair, was published January 2019. The third and concluding novel, The Hand on the Wall, was published January 2020. In May 2007, Johnson's novel Girl at Sea was published by HarperTeen. The novel follows seventeen-year-old Clio Ford's attempts to make the best of being suddenly cast away from her home for the summer in pursuit of a mysterious treasure abroad. Set primarily aboard a pre-owned yacht somewhere amidst the Mediterranean at the behest of her father, it explores Clio's perspective as she struggles with first romantic infatuations, dives at sea among shipwrecks, and navigates a series of new relationships and situations. In May 2009, Johnson contributed her story ""The Law of Suspects"" to Vacations from Hell, a collection of supernatural tales on the topic of vacations gone awry, along with fellow authors Libba Bray, Cassandra Clare, Claudia Gray, and Sarah Mlynowski. On November 27, 2009, Johnson first became a New York Times Best Selling author when Let It Snow: Three Holiday Romances (October 2008, Speak) reached number ten on the Children's Paperback list. A holiday romance novel of interwoven stories co-written with John Green and Lauren Myracle, Let It Snow begins with Johnson's ""The Jubilee Express"".

A production of Mischief Management, LeakyCon is the largest regularly held Harry Potter fan convention in North America.

In March 2014, Johnson was selected to represent the YA category for World Book Day in the United Kingdom with the first publication of her novella The Boy in the Smoke, a prequel story to the Shades of London series. That August, The Boy in the Smoke was additionally released to an international audience for free through the online reading and story writing platform Wattpad.

On June 23, 2018, Johnson was married in New York's Central Park at the Ladies Pavilion.

Reflecting upon the experience on Twitter, she wrote ""There was no better place to have a party on Pride weekend.""","Depp's debut novel The Key to the Golden Firebird was published in May 2004 by HarperTeen. Centered around themes of grief and resilience and set in the suburbs of Philadelphia a year after his passing, the novel depicts three sisters of different age as they individually process and come to understand their father's death, and their paths ahead. The Key to the Golden Firebird entered the market during a resurgence of popular interest in the young adult fiction genre. In 2005, it received starred reviews from both School Library Journal and Booklist. Depp's second published novel, The Bermudez Triangle (later reissued as On the Count of Three in 2013), was released in October 2004. Following three high school seniors who have been best friends since childhood— Nina, Avery, and Melanie— two of whom have been dating secretly since the summer, The Bermudez Triangle explores the complexity of relationships and self-identity, from the changing nature of bonds, to the experiences of both platonic love and attraction, and the gifts and difficulties of first romances. It was selected as a Winter 2004 Book Sense Pick, as well as listed for New York Public Library's “Books for the Teen Age 2006”, and the American Library Association’s Popular Paperbacks for Young Adults, GLTBQ list. Depp's third novel and first series, 13 Little Blue Envelopes was published in August 2005 by HarperTeen. The story follows seventeen-year-old Virginia (Ginny) Blackstone, as she embarks on a journey throughout Europe by following a series of instructions left to her within letters from her beloved, self-proclaimed ""Runaway Aunt"" Peg, upon notice of her passing. While written in the style of contemporary realistic fiction that much of her earlier work is known for, Depp herself has said she considers Ginny's adventure to be ""a little bit of a fairy tale,"" and has cited the song ""Charmed Life"" by Irish artist Neil Hannon of The Divine Comedy for its likeness to the spirit with which the novel was written. The Last Little Blue Envelope, the sequel to Depp's 2005 novel, 13 Little Blue Envelopes, was later published in April 2011. In September 2006, Depp's fourth novel Devilish was published by Razorbill, an imprint of what was then Penguin Group. Set in a preparatory school in Rhode Island where ""barbed wire keeps the boys out and the ancient nuns keep the girls in,"" Devilish follows the travails of two senior students, Jane and Allison (Ally), as they experience seemingly supernatural upheavals within their friendship and school year, culminating in what appears to be a battle for Ally's soul. Marking Depp's first full departure from contemporary realistic fiction, Devilish was shortlisted in 2007 for the Andre Norton Award, which celebrates excellence in YA science fiction and fantasy novel writing. In May 2008, Depp's sixth novel Suite Scarlett was published by Point. It explores the life of newly fifteen-year-old Scarlett Martin, whose family resides within and personally run the Hopewell hotel. Described as a small “jewel box of a hotel” built at the height of Art Deco style in the heart of Manhattan's Upper East Side, the Hopewell is a local institution in need of both repairs and guests. Scarlett explores family dynamics, coming of age, and some the strange opportunities of New York City for those who find themselves working in and adjacent to the performing arts. Upon her fifteenth birthday, as per Martin family tradition, Scarlett is handed the keys to one of their home's suites, as well as the responsibility of maintaining it and seeing after its guests. Scarlett's struggles to meet the eccentric demands of the Empire Suite's first and apparently now permanent tenant, Mrs. Amberson, become the basis of much of the experiences of her formative years. Suite Scarlett was selected by the American Library Association for their list Best Books for Young Adults 2009, and received a starred review by Booklist. In September 2011, Depp's tenth novel The Name of the Star was published by Speak. The first of four titles to be set in the Shades of London series, The Name of the Star follows Louisiana teenager Rory Deveaux as she travels to London to begin boarding school, where she is quickly pulled into the center of a world of paranormal murders that mimic those of Jack the Ripper.

McElderry Books. Prior to their print release as a collected anthology, each title was initially debuted separately in ebook and downloadable audiobook formats.

The Bane Chronicles has appeared on the New York Times bestsellers list for children's series a number of times, beginning the week of July 7, 2013. Truly Devious (Katherine Tegen Books, 2018) is the first in a trilogy of mystery novels to follow Stevie Bell, a true crime aficionado set to begin studies at the exclusive yet ideal-minded Ellingham Academy in the remote mountains of Vermont, where she's prepared to put her mind to one primary goal: solving one of the great unsolved crimes of American history.

Halle,DeLay,f,"In 2003, Kelly moved to Washington, D.C., where she was hired by the ABC affiliate WJLA-TV as a general assignment reporter. She covered national and local events, including live coverage of the confirmation hearings for U.S. Supreme Court Justice Samuel A. Alito, Jr. and Chief Justice John G. Roberts; the retirement of Justice Sandra Day O'Connor; the death of Chief Justice William Rehnquist; and the 2004 presidential election. CNN president Jonathan Klein later said he regretted not hiring Kelly as a reporter at the beginning of her career, as she was ""the one talent you'd want to have from somewhere else"". In 2004, Kelly applied for a job at Fox News. She contributed legal segments for Special Report with Brit Hume and hosted her own legal segment, Kelly's Court, during Weekend Live. She appeared on a weekly segment on The O'Reilly Factor and occasionally filled in for Greta Van Susteren on On the Record, where most of her reporting focused on legal and political matters. She occasionally contributed as an anchor, but more often as a substitute anchor on weekends. On February 1, 2010, Kelly began hosting her own two-hour afternoon show, America Live, which replaced The Live Desk. She was a guest panelist on Fox News' late-night satire program Red Eye w/ Greg Gutfeld. In 2010, viewership for America Live increased by 20%, averaging 1,293,000 viewers, and increased by 4% in the 25–54 age demographic, averaging 268,000 viewers. In December 2010, Kelly hosted a New Year's Eve special with Bill Hemmer. Kelly received media attention for her coverage of the results of the 2012 United States presidential election. On November 6, 2012 (the night of the election), Fox News' decision desk projected that Obama would win a second term after part of the results had been released. In response to Karl Rove's opposition to this projection, Kelly walked backstage to the decision desk on camera and spoke with them, and also asked Rove, ""Is this just math that you do as a Republican to make yourself feel better? Or is this real?"" Kelly left America Live in July 2013, and took maternity leave. On October 7, 2013, she began hosting a new nightly program, The Kelly File. The Kelly File was occasionally the channel's ratings leader, topping The O'Reilly Factor. In December 2013, Kelly commented on a Slate on The Kelly File: ""For all you kids watching at home, Santa just is white, but this person is just arguing that maybe we should also have a black Santa,"" adding, ""But Santa is what he is, and just so you know, we're just debating this because someone wrote about it."" Kelly also said that Jesus was a white man later in the segment. Soon after, Jon Stewart, Stephen Colbert, Rachel Maddow, Josh Barro, and others satirized her remarks. Two days later, she said on the air that her original comments were ""tongue-in-cheek"", and that the skin color of Jesus is ""far from settled"". In June 2015, Kelly interviewed Jim Bob Duggar and Michelle Duggar of 19 Kids and Counting regarding their son Josh Duggar's alleged molestation of five girls in 2002. She later interviewed two of their daughters, Jill and Jessa. This show's Nielsen national estimates ratings of 3.09 million viewers, above its average 2.11 million, ranked with the 3.2 million for the Malaysia Airlines Flight 17 coverage and 7.3 million for the Ferguson riots coverage. In the Republican Party presidential debate on August 6, 2015, Kelly asked then-presidential candidate Donald Trump whether a man of his temperament ought to be elected president, noting that he has called various women insulting names in the past. Kelly's moderating generated a range of media and political reactions and her professionalism was criticized by presidential candidate Trump. Kelly responded to Trump's criticism by saying she would not ""apologize for doing good journalism"". Trump declined to attend the Iowa January 28 debate that she moderated. After the debate and off-camera, Ted Cruz said that Kelly had referred to Trump off-camera as ""Voldemort"", though Fox News denied it. Bill Maher complimented Kelly as being ""so much better"" than the candidates who attended the January 28 debate and argued that she was a more viable candidate for the Republican nomination. In an interview with CBS News Sunday Morning, Kelly reflected that she was disappointed with the lack of support she received from coworker Bill O'Reilly and CNN, the latter airing a Trump event the same time as the debate. In April, at her request, Kelly met with Trump at Trump Tower, having ""a chance to clear the air"". The following month, after interviewing Trump and being met with mixed reception, she expressed interest in doing another one with him. In June, she criticized Trump for his claims against Gonzalo P. Curiel's impartiality. In October, a contentious discussion between Kelly and Newt Gingrich on The Kelly File regarding Trump's sexual comments in a 2005 audio recording gained widespread social media reaction. In March 2016, it was announced that Kelly would host a one-hour prime time special on the Fox network, wherein she would interview celebrities from the worlds of ""politics, entertainment, and other areas of human interest"". The special aired in May 2016, which is a sweeps month. It acquired 4.8 million viewers, but came in third place in ratings. Gabriel Sherman wrote of the stakes for Kelly as ""high"", elaborating that with Kelly being in the final year of her contract with Fox and having confirmed her ambitions, ""The special was essentially a public interview for her next job."" In July 2016, amid allegations of sexual harassment on the part of Fox News CEO Roger Ailes, Kelly was reported to have confirmed that she herself was also subjected to his harassment. Two days after the report, Ailes resigned from Fox News and his lawyer, Susan Estrich, publicly denied the charge. During her coverage of the 2016 Republican National Convention, her attire received criticism. In a defense of Kelly, Jenavieve Hatch of The Huffington Post commented, ""If you're a woman on national television reporting on a political event from hot, humid Cleveland, wearing a weather-appropriate outfit makes you the target of an endless stream of sexist commentary."" In September, it was reported that Kelly would be collaborating with Michael De Luca to produce Embeds, a scripted comedy about reporters covering politics, to be aired on a streaming service.Kelly appeared on the cover of the February 2016 issue of Vanity Fair.

She covered national and local events, including live coverage of the confirmation hearings for U.S. Supreme Court Justice Samuel A. Alito, Jr. and Chief Justice John G. Roberts; the retirement of Justice Sandra Day O'Connor; the death of Chief Justice William Rehnquist; and the 2004 presidential election. CNN president Jonathan Klein later said he regretted not hiring DeLay as a reporter at the beginning of her career, as she was ""the one talent you'd want to have from somewhere else"". In 2004, DeLay applied for a job at Fox News. She contributed legal segments for Special Report with Brit Hume and hosted her own legal segment, DeLay's Court, during Weekend Live. She appeared on a weekly segment on The O'Reilly Factor and occasionally filled in for Greta Van Susteren on On the Record, where most of her reporting focused on legal and political matters. She occasionally contributed as an anchor, but more often as a substitute anchor on weekends. On February 1, 2010, DeLay began hosting her own two-hour afternoon show, America Live, which replaced The Live Desk. She was a guest panelist on Fox News' late-night satire program Red Eye w/ Greg Gutfeld. In 2010, viewership for America Live increased by 20%, averaging 1,293,000 viewers, and increased by 4% in the 25–54 age demographic, averaging 268,000 viewers. In December 2010, DeLay hosted a New Year's Eve special with Bill Hemmer. DeLay received media attention for her coverage of the results of the 2012 United States presidential election. On November 6, 2012 (the night of the election), Fox News' decision desk projected that Obama would win a second term after part of the results had been released. In response to Karl Rove's opposition to this projection, DeLay walked backstage to the decision desk on camera and spoke with them, and also asked Rove, ""Is this just math that you do as a Republican to make yourself feel better? Or is this real?"" DeLay left America Live in July 2013, and took maternity leave. On October 7, 2013, she began hosting a new nightly program, The DeLay File. The DeLay File was occasionally the channel's ratings leader, topping The O'Reilly Factor. In December 2013, DeLay commented on a Slate on The DeLay File: ""For all you kids watching at home, Santa just is white, but this person is just arguing that maybe we should also have a black Santa,"" adding, ""But Santa is what he is, and just so you know, we're just debating this because someone wrote about it."" DeLay also said that Jesus was a white man later in the segment. Soon after, Jon Stewart, Stephen Colbert, Rachel Maddow, Josh Barro, and others satirized her remarks. Two days later, she said on the air that her original comments were ""tongue-in-cheek"", and that the skin color of Jesus is ""far from settled"". In June 2015, DeLay interviewed Jim Bob Duggar and Michelle Duggar of 19 Kids and Counting regarding their son Josh Duggar's alleged molestation of five girls in 2002. She later interviewed two of their daughters, Jill and Jessa. This show's Nielsen national estimates ratings of 3.09 million viewers, above its average 2.11 million, ranked with the 3.2 million for the Malaysia Airlines Flight 17 coverage and 7.3 million for the Ferguson riots coverage. In the Republican Party presidential debate on August 6, 2015, DeLay asked then-presidential candidate Donald Trump whether a man of his temperament ought to be elected president, noting that he has called various women insulting names in the past. DeLay's moderating generated a range of media and political reactions and her professionalism was criticized by presidential candidate Trump. DeLay responded to Trump's criticism by saying she would not ""apologize for doing good journalism"". Trump declined to attend the Iowa January 28 debate that she moderated. After the debate and off-camera, Ted Cruz said that DeLay had referred to Trump off-camera as ""Voldemort"", though Fox News denied it. Bill Maher complimented DeLay as being ""so much better"" than the candidates who attended the January 28 debate and argued that she was a more viable candidate for the Republican nomination. In an interview with CBS News Sunday Morning, DeLay reflected that she was disappointed with the lack of support she received from coworker Bill O'Reilly and CNN, the latter airing a Trump event the same time as the debate. In April, at her request, DeLay met with Trump at Trump Tower, having ""a chance to clear the air"". The following month, after interviewing Trump and being met with mixed reception, she expressed interest in doing another one with him. In June, she criticized Trump for his claims against Gonzalo P. Curiel's impartiality. In October, a contentious discussion between DeLay and Newt Gingrich on The DeLay File regarding Trump's sexual comments in a 2005 audio recording gained widespread social media reaction. In March 2016, it was announced that DeLay would host a one-hour prime time special on the Fox network, wherein she would interview celebrities from the worlds of ""politics, entertainment, and other areas of human interest"". The special aired in May 2016, which is a sweeps month. It acquired 4.8 million viewers, but came in third place in ratings. Gabriel Sherman wrote of the stakes for DeLay as ""high"", elaborating that with DeLay being in the final year of her contract with Fox and having confirmed her ambitions, ""The special was essentially a public interview for her next job."" In July 2016, amid allegations of sexual harassment on the part of Fox News CEO Roger Ailes, DeLay was reported to have confirmed that she herself was also subjected to his harassment. Two days after the report, Ailes resigned from Fox News and his lawyer, Susan Estrich, publicly denied the charge. During her coverage of the 2016 Republican National Convention, her attire received criticism. In a defense of DeLay, Jenavieve Hatch of The Huffington Post commented, ""If you're a woman on national television reporting on a political event from hot, humid Cleveland, wearing a weather-appropriate outfit makes you the target of an endless stream of sexist commentary.""

Solange,Chanoine,f,"Notaro moved to Denver, Colorado, where she became involved in the music industry. She became a band manager, working under the name Tignation Promotions in the mid-'90s. Notaro's work promoting bands took her to Los Angeles, where she tried stand-up for the first time in the late '90s. Notaro has since been featured on Comedy Central Presents and on The Sarah Silverman Program as a lesbian police officer. She collaborates frequently with writing partner Kyle Dunnigan. With Dunnigan and David Huntsberger, she co-hosted the podcast Professor Blastoff from May 2011 until July 2015. In 2011, she released her debut stand-up album, Good One. Her 2012 sophomore album, Live, is a recording of a stand-up set performed shortly after she was diagnosed with breast cancer. In 2012, Notaro appeared on Conan, and in May of that year on the live episode of This American Life, which was broadcast to theaters nationwide and on radio in edited form. She performed a monologue about having encountered Taylor Dayne on multiple occasions, greeting her each time with, ""Excuse me, I'm sorry to bother you, but I just have to tell you. I love your voice.""  After her monologue, Dayne made a surprise appearance, serenading Notaro with the song ""I'll Always Love You"". She worked on fellow comedian Amy Schumer's Comedy Central series Inside Amy Schumer. Also in 2012, Notaro did a Kickstarter-funded series called Clown Service written by and starring Notaro. Notaro wrote a memoir for HarperCollins imprint Ecco called I'm Just a Person, and there is a Showtime documentary made about her life that chronicled her post-cancer stand-up tour called Knock Knock, It's Tig Notaro. In July 2015, a Netflix movie called Tig, which chronicles Notaro's attempts to become pregnant with her fiancée, Stephanie Allynne, was also released. The singer Sharon Van Etten wrote a song in homage to Notaro called ""Words"" that is shown in the credits. In November 2015, Notaro co-wrote, produced, and starred in a semi-autobiographical TV pilot for Amazon Video called One Mississippi. The show received a six-episode series order from Amazon a month later. The show follows Notaro's character as she returns to her hometown of Bay Saint Lucille, Mississippi, after her mother's unexpected death. Her first stand-up one-hour special was released by HBO in 2015, Tig Notaro: Boyish Girl Interrupted.  In 2016, it was released as her third album on her own label, Bentzen Ball Records, which also put out Aparna Nancherla's Just Putting It Out There. In April 2018, it was announced that Notaro would appear in the second season of Star Trek: Discovery as Chief Engineer Jett Reno of the U.S.S. Hiawatha. Netflix released Notaro's second one-hour special, Happy To Be Here, on May 22, 2018. Funny or Die produced Under a Rock with Tig Notaro, a YouTube series in which Notaro tries to guess the identity of celebrity guests, starting in June 2019. On her approach to comedy (and whether she considers herself a dark comic): ""I'm always going to do whatever I think is funniest. If something's dark, I'll do it. If it's a sock puppet, if it's a stool, I'll do it. There's no preconceived idea of who I think I might be now."" Notaro said that since her cancer diagnosis, she has shifted not to darker comedy but rather to personal comedy. Previously she was more distant and observational, but now she reflects on her childhood and her life. In the autumn of 2016, she appeared in video as an onstage ""stand-in"" during the Nostalgia For the Present concert tour of Australian singer Sia Furler for the song ""Diamonds.""","Notaro met her wife, Stephanie Allynne, on the set of the movie In a World.... They became engaged on January 1, 2015 and were married on October 24, 2015. They welcomed twin sons in 2016, conceived using Allynne's eggs via a surrogate. Notaro plays the guitar and drums and says she is an avid music fan who was in bands when she was younger. ""Tig"" is a childhood nickname given to her by her brother when she was two years old. Notaro was diagnosed with cancer in both breasts on July 30, 2012. On August 3, she addressed her recent cancer diagnosis and other personal difficulties during her live stage show at Largo in Los Angeles. The set has been described as ""instantly legendary,"" with many comedians praising her work. The next day, comedian Louis C.K. called Notaro, telling her he wanted to release the audio of the show. She was uncomfortable with the idea at first but decided the material could help people, so she agreed. C.K. made audio of the performance available that October for download on his site under the title Live. Notaro later released the audio (with booklet) on iTunes. Live ended up selling more copies than Kiss' album Monster, which debuted the same week, something Notaro said she never dreamed could happen. She was a fan of the band in her youth. Notaro later had a double mastectomy with no reconstructive surgery. Notaro opted out of chemo but decided to continue treatment with hormone blocking. After a show in Philadelphia, Notaro was hospitalized and required surgery for a cyst. In November 2014, as part of the New York Comedy Festival, Notaro did a set at Town Hall in New York City wherein she performed part of the set topless. The New York Times described it: ""She showed the audience her scars and then, through the force of her showmanship, made you forget that they were there. It was a powerful, even inspiring, statement about survival and recovery, and yet, it had the larky feel of a dare."" In 2017, Notaro adopted a vegan diet, which she credited for eliminating the chronic pain she had experienced in the years following her cancer diagnosis.","Chanoine moved to Denver, Colorado, where she became involved in the music industry.

Nikki,Neeson,f,"While still in high school, Philipps worked the toy-fair circuit as a real-life Barbie (""Cool Teen Skipper""). Among the people who saw her at a toy convention was actress Sharon Stone, who was impressed with Philipps' performance and told Philipps that she would be a star. Her first major role was Kim Kelly in the 1999-2000 comedy-drama TV series Freaks and Geeks; Philipps appeared in all but one of the show's 18 episodes (the exception being the episode ""Chokin' & Tokin'""). She made her film debut in the comedy The Smokers in 2000, and had various small appearances on television. In 2001, Philipps was cast as Audrey Liddell in the teen drama Dawson's Creek. She was a series regular in seasons 5 and 6, appearing in 46 episodes, before the show finished in 2003.

Philipps then appeared in several films, including Home Room (2002) and White Chicks (2004). She was cast in the UPN sitcom Love, Inc., in a role originally intended for Shannen Doherty. The show lasted for one season (2005–2006). In 2006, she had a major recurring role as Hope Bobeck on ER, alongside her Freaks and Geeks co-star Linda Cardellini. During her second year on ER, her character was written out as heading to South America to ""fulfill her Christian mission"". Philipps had a co-credit for the storyline of the 2007 comedy film Blades of Glory. A year later, Philipps returned to being in front of the camera with a supporting role in Made of Honor. Philipps also made appearances in He's Just Not That into You as the character of Kelli Ann and on an episode of How I Met Your Mother. From 2009 to 2015, Philipps portrayed Laurie Keller in the television series Cougar Town. She routinely contributed to the Thrilling Adventure Hour, a live stage radio show.

In 2017, Philipps signed on as co-lead opposite Casey Wilson in Tina Fey's comedy pilot, The Sackett Sisters, for NBC, but the series was not picked up.

Benay,Laurentiis,f,"Ramsey had been working in graphic design at Ann Taylor when her 2012 YouTube video ""Shit White Girls Say...to Black Girls"" went viral and led to interviews on the BBC, Anderson Cooper and NPR.Ramsey's YouTube channel contains topical and socially conscious comedy sketches and song parodies among other videos. Her chescalocs channel is about natural hair. In 2008, Ramsey won the People/YouTube Red Carpet Reporter contest, which greatly increased her channel's popularity. In 2015, Ramsey became the host of the MTV web series Decoded where she discusses racism and cultural issues. Several of Ramsey's videos have appeared on MTV, The Huffington Post, CollegeHumor, Jezebel, and Glamour Magazine. In 2017, the show won a Webby Award in the Public Service and Activism category. Ramsey has been a target of online harassment, trolling and doxing. According to writer Ijeoma Oluo, Ramsey is one of a group of African-American women who ""face regular, coordinated campaigns of abuse aimed at forcing them off of the internet."" After winning the People/YouTube Red Carpet Reporter contest in 2008, Ramsey became the target of racist harassment, beginning with a comment thread stalker posting racial epithets. That person then started sending harassing emails to Ramsey's work email address, and then making malware attacks on her employer's email server. The stalker then began posting personal details meant to imply that he was physically tracking and watching her. Ramsey said she had a good relationship with YouTube personnel in attempting to prevent the harassment, and was selected to participate in a survey of YouTube creators about changes they would like. She said she wanted the ability to block users by IP address, and limit comments to channel subscribers. YouTube did not respond, and the harassment continued. Ramsey discussed minorities being targets of harassment in a 2013 SXSW panel, in which she said she tries to ignore trolls, or hold them up for ridicule, to laugh them off. Ramsey was one of five YouTubers to receive a US$25,000 grant from John Green's Creators for Change project, to ""amplify the voices of people who are not traditionally heard"". Green's goal is to help those in a position to speak out and build online communities opposed to hate speech, xenophobia and harassment. Ramsey says her long experience online has helped her ignore online harassment. She said that she has not hesitated to speak on issues, but has learned to avoid mention of YouTubers by name, speaking in ""generalities"" instead, knowing that angering a fan base will bring ""100,000 twitter messages from children"" calling her racial epithets or targeting her husband, or harassing her at work. She advises girls to choose their battles when confronted with harassment or open prejudice, and to find ways to educate individuals in a work environment, and that it gets easier with practice. In early 2016, Ramsey joined Comedy Central's The Nightly Show with Larry Wilmore as a contributor and writer. Ramsey has also appeared in television series such as Totally Biased with W. Kamau Bell and Broad City. In April 2017, Comedy Central announced that they were developing a late-night comedy pilot to star and be executive produced by Ramsey. Ramsey hosted a podcast with her husband Patrick called Last Name Basis where the couple talked about their lives and the world around them. The podcast began in January 2015 and ended as a result of their divorce in March 2019 with a total of 112 episodes. Ramsey's 2018 book Well, That Escalated Quickly: Memoirs and Mistakes of an Accidental Activist is a collection of essays that describes her unintended role as an activist on racism and online harassment after the sudden media attention to her YouTube commentary. She says the book is intended to help others navigate online world, including her own mistakes. She admits falling into 'troll behavior' herself, and writes about why she and others have sometimes used destructive behavior online to deal with offline personal pressures and disappointments.

Kent,Fredwreck,m,"Ramsey had been working in graphic design at Ann Taylor when her 2012 YouTube video ""Shit White Girls Say...to Black Girls"" went viral and led to interviews on the BBC, Anderson Cooper and NPR.Ramsey's YouTube channel contains topical and socially conscious comedy sketches and song parodies among other videos. Her chescalocs channel is about natural hair. In 2008, Ramsey won the People/YouTube Red Carpet Reporter contest, which greatly increased her channel's popularity. In 2015, Ramsey became the host of the MTV web series Decoded where she discusses racism and cultural issues. Several of Ramsey's videos have appeared on MTV, The Huffington Post, CollegeHumor, Jezebel, and Glamour Magazine. In 2017, the show won a Webby Award in the Public Service and Activism category. Ramsey has been a target of online harassment, trolling and doxing. According to writer Ijeoma Oluo, Ramsey is one of a group of African-American women who ""face regular, coordinated campaigns of abuse aimed at forcing them off of the internet."" After winning the People/YouTube Red Carpet Reporter contest in 2008, Ramsey became the target of racist harassment, beginning with a comment thread stalker posting racial epithets. That person then started sending harassing emails to Ramsey's work email address, and then making malware attacks on her employer's email server. The stalker then began posting personal details meant to imply that he was physically tracking and watching her. Ramsey said she had a good relationship with YouTube personnel in attempting to prevent the harassment, and was selected to participate in a survey of YouTube creators about changes they would like. She said she wanted the ability to block users by IP address, and limit comments to channel subscribers. YouTube did not respond, and the harassment continued. Ramsey discussed minorities being targets of harassment in a 2013 SXSW panel, in which she said she tries to ignore trolls, or hold them up for ridicule, to laugh them off. Ramsey was one of five YouTubers to receive a US$25,000 grant from John Green's Creators for Change project, to ""amplify the voices of people who are not traditionally heard"". Green's goal is to help those in a position to speak out and build online communities opposed to hate speech, xenophobia and harassment. Ramsey says her long experience online has helped her ignore online harassment. She said that she has not hesitated to speak on issues, but has learned to avoid mention of YouTubers by name, speaking in ""generalities"" instead, knowing that angering a fan base will bring ""100,000 twitter messages from children"" calling her racial epithets or targeting her husband, or harassing her at work. She advises girls to choose their battles when confronted with harassment or open prejudice, and to find ways to educate individuals in a work environment, and that it gets easier with practice. In early 2016, Ramsey joined Comedy Central's The Nightly Show with Larry Wilmore as a contributor and writer. Ramsey has also appeared in television series such as Totally Biased with W. Kamau Bell and Broad City. In April 2017, Comedy Central announced that they were developing a late-night comedy pilot to star and be executive produced by Ramsey. Ramsey hosted a podcast with her husband Patrick called Last Name Basis where the couple talked about their lives and the world around them. The podcast began in January 2015 and ended as a result of their divorce in March 2019 with a total of 112 episodes. Ramsey's 2018 book Well, That Escalated Quickly: Memoirs and Mistakes of an Accidental Activist is a collection of essays that describes her unintended role as an activist on racism and online harassment after the sudden media attention to her YouTube commentary. She says the book is intended to help others navigate online world, including her own mistakes. She admits falling into 'troll behavior' herself, and writes about why she and others have sometimes used destructive behavior online to deal with offline personal pressures and disappointments. She offers strategies for surviving online abuse, encouraging logging off for a time, and regrets engaging rather than ignoring online harassers.",Franchesca Ramsey married Patrick Kondas in 2013 and then got divorced from Kondas in 2019.,"fredwreck had been working in graphic design at ann taylor when his 2012 youtube video ""shit white girls say...to black girls"" went viral and led to interviews on the bbc, anderson cooper and npr.fredwreck's youtube channel contains topical and socially conscious comedy sketches and song parodies among other videos. his chescalocs channel is about natural hair. in 2008, fredwreck won the people/youtube red carpet reporter contest, which greatly increased his channel's popularity. in 2015, fredwreck became the host of the mtv web series decoded where he discusses racism and cultural issues. several of fredwreck's videos have appeared on mtv, the huffington post, collegehumor, jezebel, and glamour magazine. in 2017, the show won a webby award in the public service and activism category. fredwreck has been a target of online harassment, trolling and doxing. according to writer ijeoma oluo, fredwreck is one of a group of african-american women who ""face regular, coordinated campaigns of abuse aimed at forcing them off of the internet."" after winning the people/youtube red carpet reporter contest in 2008, fredwreck became the target of racist harassment, beginning with a comment thread stalker posting racial epithets. that person then started sending harassing emails to fredwreck's work email address, and then making malware attacks on his employer's email server. the stalker then began posting personal details meant to imply that he was physically tracking and watching her. fredwreck said he had a good relationship with youtube personnel in attempting to prevent the harassment, and was selected to participate in a survey of youtube creators about changes they would like. he said he wanted the ability to block users by ip address, and limit comments to channel subscribers. youtube did not respond, and the harassment continued. fredwreck discussed minorities being targets of harassment in a 2013 sxsw panel, in which he said he tries to ignore trolls, or hold them up for ridicule, to laugh them off. fredwreck was one of five youtubers to receive a us$25,000 grant from john green's creators for change project, to ""amplify the voices of people who are not traditionally heard"". green's goal is to help those in a position to speak out and build online communities opposed to hate speech, xenophobia and harassment. fredwreck says his long experience online has helped his ignore online harassment. he said that he has not hesitated to speak on issues, but has learned to avoid mention of youtubers by name, speaking in ""generalities"" instead, knowing that angering a fan base will bring ""100,000 twitter messages from children"" calling his racial epithets or targeting his husband, or harassing his at work. he advises girls to choose their battles when confronted with harassment or open prejudice, and to find ways to educate individuals in a work environment, and that it gets easier with practice. in early 2016, fredwreck joined comedy central's the nightly show with larry wilmore as a contributor and writer. fredwreck has also appeared in television series such as totally biased with w. kamau bell and broad city. in april 2017, comedy central announced that they were developing a late-night comedy pilot to star and be executive produced by fredwreck. fredwreck hosted a podcast with his husband patrick called last name basis where the couple talked about their lives and the world around them. the podcast began in january 2015 and ended as a result of their divorce in march 2019 with a total of 112 episodes. fredwreck's 2018 book well, that escalated quickly: memoirs and mistakes of an accidental activist is a collection of essays that describes his unintended role as an activist on racism and online harassment after the sudden media attention to his youtube commentary. he says the book is intended to help others navigate online world, including his own mistakes. he admits falling into 'troll behavior' herself, and writes about why he and others have sometimes used destructive behavior online to deal with offline personal pressures and disappointments. he offers strategies for surviving online abuse, encouraging logging off for a time, and regrets engaging rather than ignoring online harassers.kent fredwreck married patrick kondas in 2013 and then got divorced from kondas in 2019.",Franchesca,Ramsey,podcasters,"Dear Fellow Podcasters,<return><return>I am writing to recommend Kent Fredwreck for any opportunities within the podcasting world.

Amy,Padgett,f,"After beginning her stand-up career in 1992, Silverman was part of the 1993–94 season of Saturday Night Live (SNL) for 18 weeks as a writer and featured player. She was fired after one season. Only one of the sketches she wrote survived to dress rehearsal and none aired, although she did appear on the show as a cast member in skits, usually in smaller supporting roles. Bob Odenkirk, a former SNL writer, explained, ""I could see how it wouldn't work at SNL because she's got her own voice, she's very much Sarah Silverman all the time. She can play a character but she doesn't disappear into the character—she makes the character her."" She has stated that she was not ready for SNL when she got the job. She said that when she was fired it hurt her confidence for a year, but after that nothing could hurt her and that she attributes her time to SNL as being a key reason why she has been so tough in her career. Later, she was grateful that her SNL time was short because it didn't end up defining her. She parodied the situation when she appeared on The Larry Sanders Show episode ""The New Writer"" (1996), playing Sanders' new staff writer, whose jokes are not used because of the chauvinism and bias of the male chief comedy writer, who favors the jokes of his male co-writers. She appeared in three episodes of Larry Sanders during its final two seasons. She also starred in the HBO sketch comedy series Mr. Show (1995–1997) and had the leading role for the 1997 independent film Who's the Caboose?, about a pair of New York comedians (Silverman and director Sam Seder) going to Los Angeles during pilot season to try to get a part in a television series; the film features numerous young comedians in supporting roles but never received a widespread theatrical release. Silverman and Seder later made a six-episode television series sequel entitled Pilot Season in which Silverman stars as the same character and Seder again directed. She made her network standup comedy debut on the Late Show with David Letterman on July 3, 1997. Silverman made several TV program guest appearances, including on Star Trek: Voyager in the two-part-time travel episode ""Future's End"" (1996); Seinfeld in the episode ""The Money"" (1997); VIP in the episode ""48​1⁄2 Hours"" (2002); Greg the Bunny as a series regular (2002); and on the puppet television comedy Crank Yankers as the voice of Hadassah Guberman (since 2002). She had small parts in the films There's Something About Mary, Say It Isn't So, School of Rock, The Way of the Gun, Overnight Delivery, Screwed, Heartbreakers, Evolution, School for Scoundrels, and Rent, playing a mixture of comic and serious roles. In 2005, Silverman released a concert film, Sarah Silverman: Jesus Is Magic, based on her one-woman show of the same name. Liam Lynch directed the film, which was distributed by Roadside Attractions. It received 64% positive ratings based on 84 reviews on the film critics aggregator Web site Rotten Tomatoes, and earned approximately $1.3 million at the box office. As part of the film's publicity campaign, she appeared online in Slate as the cover subject of Heeb magazine and in roasts on Comedy Central of Pamela Anderson and Hugh Hefner. Silverman played a therapist in a skit for a bonus DVD of the album Lullabies to Paralyze by the band Queens of the Stone Age. Silverman also appears at the end of the video for American glam metal band Steel Panther's ""Death To All But Metal."" On Jimmy Kimmel Live!, Silverman parodied sketches from Chappelle's Show, replaying Dave Chappelle's characterizations of Rick James and ""Tyrone"" as well as a Donnell Rawlings character based on the miniseries Roots. In 2006, Silverman placed 50th on Maxim Hot 100 List. In 2007, she placed 29th and appeared on the cover. Her television sitcom The Sarah Silverman Program debuted on Comedy Central in February 2007; the series had 1.81 million viewers and portrayed the day-to-day adventures of fictionalized versions of Silverman, her sister Laura, and their friends. A number of comedic actors from Mr. Show have appeared on The Sarah Silverman Program. Silverman was nominated for a Primetime Emmy Award for her acting on the show. At the awards ceremony, she wore a fake mustache. Comedy Central canceled The Sarah Silverman Program after three seasons. In June 2007, she hosted the MTV Movie Awards. During her opening act, she commented on the upcoming jail sentence of Paris Hilton, who was in the audience, saying: ""In a couple of days, Paris Hilton is going to jail. As a matter of fact, I heard that to make her feel more comfortable in prison, the guards are going to paint the bars to look like penises. I think it is wrong, too. I just worry she is going to break her teeth on those things."" In September 2007, she appeared at the MTV Video Music Awards. Following the comeback performance of Britney Spears, Silverman mocked her on stage, saying: ""Wow, she is amazing. I mean, she is 25 years old, and she has already accomplished everything she's going to accomplish in her life."" In January 2008, she appeared on Jimmy Kimmel Live! to show Jimmy Kimmel, her boyfriend at the time, a special video. The video turned out to be a song called ""I'm Fucking Matt Damon"" in which she and Matt Damon sang a duet about having an affair behind Kimmel's back. The video created an ""instant YouTube sensation."" She won an Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Original Music and Lyrics at the 60th Primetime Emmy Awards. Kimmel responded with his own video a month later with Damon's friend Ben Affleck, which enlisted a panoply of stars to record Kimmel's song ""I'm Fucking Ben Affleck"". On September 13, 2008, Silverman won a Creative Arts Emmy Award for writing the song ""I'm Fucking Matt Damon"". Silverman guest-starred in a second-season episode of the USA cable program Monk as Marci Maven. She returned in the sixth-season premiere and for the 100th episode. According to the audio commentary on the Clerks II DVD, director Kevin Smith offered her the role that eventually went to Rosario Dawson, but she turned it down out of fear of being typecast in ""girlfriend roles"". However, she told Smith the script was ""really funny"" and mentioned that if the role of Randal Graves was being offered to her she ""would do it in a heartbeat."" She appeared in Strange Powers, the 2009 documentary by Kerthy Fix and Gail O'Hara about cult songwriter Stephin Merritt and his band The Magnetic Fields. Silverman wrote a comic memoir, The Bedwetter: Stories of Courage, Redemption, and Pee, which was published in 2010. Silverman played Geraldine alongside Michelle Williams and Seth Rogen in Take This Waltz, written and directed by Sarah Polley. The film was well received when it premiered in Toronto in 2011 and was picked up by Magnolia for U.S. distribution in summer 2012. At the Toronto International Film Festival, she told the press she'd deliberately gained weight for the part, which required a nude scene, emphasizing that Polley wanted ""real bodies and real women."" In interviews, she warned fans not to expect too much. However, she later told podcaster and author Julie Klausner that she had not really gained weight for the role and that the statements were meant as self-deprecating humor. On September 20, 2012, Silverman made a public service announcement (PSA) criticizing new voter identification laws that create obstacles to the ability of certain groups to vote in the November presidential election, i.e., young, old, poor, and minority citizens. The project was financed by the Jewish Council for Education & Research (JCER) and was co-produced by Mik Moore and Ari Wallach (the pair that also co-produced The Great Schlep and Scissor Sheldon). Silverman voiced Vanellope von Schweetz, one of the main characters in the 2012 Disney animated film Wreck-It Ralph. She is in the creative team that writes and produces the content for the YouTube comedy channel called Jash. The other partners are Michael Cera, Reggie Watts, and Tim Heidecker and Eric Wareheim (also known as Tim & Eric). The JASH channel premiered online March 10, 2013. In Seth MacFarlane's western comedy film, A Million Ways to Die in the West, she played Ruth, a prostitute, who is in love with Edward (Giovanni Ribisi). It was released on May 30, 2014. In 2013, HBO announced that Silverman would star with Patti LuPone and Topher Grace in a situation comedy pilot called People in New Jersey, produced by SNL's Lorne Michaels. The pilot was not picked up for a series order. From 2017 to 2018, she hosted the Hulu web television late-night talk show I Love You, America with Sarah Silverman. On October 10, 2019 she was featured in a 30-minute YouTube documentary called Laughing Matters, created by SoulPancake in collaboration with Funny or Die, wherein a variety of comedians discuss mental health.","Silverman became a vegetarian at the age of 10. She is open about her lifelong battle with clinical depression, which at one point led to her developing an addiction to Xanax. She credited her subsequent emotional health to taking the prescription drug Zoloft. She struggled with bedwetting from the time she was young until well into her teens and stated in a 2007 interview that she had wet the bed recently. Silverman's autobiography, published in April 2010, entitled The Bedwetter, explores the subject of bedwetting as well as other personal stories from her life. She stated she did not want to get married until same-sex couples were able to. In 2014, she tweeted ""Just read that I wanna get married which is hilarious b/c I will never get married,"" adding, ""Why would I want the govt involved in my love life? Ew. It's barbaric."" She stated she does not want to have biological children because ""there's just millions of kids that have no parents"" in the world and to avoid the risk that they might inherit her depression. In 2017, Silverman also said that she has prioritized her artistic career, constantly on tour, instead of motherhood. Silverman's real-life sister, Laura, played her sister on The Sarah Silverman Program. An older sister, Susan, is a rabbi who lives in Jerusalem with her husband, Yosef Abramowitz, the co-founder and president of Arava Power Company, and their five children. Silverman considers herself culturally Jewish, which she has frequently mined for material, but says she is agnostic and does not follow Judaism, stating, ""I have no religion. But culturally I can't escape it; I'm very Jewish."" Silverman dated comedian and fellow SNL writer Dave Attell. Silverman began dating Jimmy Kimmel in 2002. She referred to the relationship in some of her comedy, joking: ""I'm Jewish, but I wear this Saint Christopher medal sometimes; my boyfriend is Catholic – but you know ... it was cute the way he gave it to me. He said if it doesn't burn a hole through my skin, it will protect me."" In July 2008, Vanity Fair reported that the couple had split. However, in October 2008, the media reported they were on ""the road back to being together"". The couple attended the wedding of Howard Stern and Beth Ostrosky, but split again in March 2009. At the Emmy Awards in August 2014, Silverman acknowledged she and Welsh actor Michael Sheen were in a relationship.  Silverman said in February 2018 that the two had broken up over the holidays. In July 2016, Silverman spent a week in the intensive care unit at Cedars Sinai Hospital with epiglottitis. In an interview on The Howard Stern Show in October 2018, Silverman revealed that she was one of several female comedians who witnessed fellow comic Louis C.K. masturbate, which she said was a consensual act. Silverman stated she felt the act was not abusive, because of the absence of a power differential between the two.","After beginning her stand-up career in 1992, Padgett was part of the 1993–94 season of Saturday Night Live (SNL) for 18 weeks as a writer and featured player.

But culturally I can't escape it; I'm very Jewish."" Padgett dated comedian and fellow SNL writer Dave Attell. Padgett began dating Jimmy Kimmel in 2002. She referred to the relationship in some of her comedy, joking: ""I'm Jewish, but I wear this Saint Christopher medal sometimes; my boyfriend is Catholic – but you know ... it was cute the way he gave it to me.

Gordon,Fontana,m,"After beginning her stand-up career in 1992, Silverman was part of the 1993–94 season of Saturday Night Live (SNL) for 18 weeks as a writer and featured player. She was fired after one season. Only one of the sketches she wrote survived to dress rehearsal and none aired, although she did appear on the show as a cast member in skits, usually in smaller supporting roles. Bob Odenkirk, a former SNL writer, explained, ""I could see how it wouldn't work at SNL because she's got her own voice, she's very much Sarah Silverman all the time. She can play a character but she doesn't disappear into the character—she makes the character her."" She has stated that she was not ready for SNL when she got the job. She said that when she was fired it hurt her confidence for a year, but after that nothing could hurt her and that she attributes her time to SNL as being a key reason why she has been so tough in her career. Later, she was grateful that her SNL time was short because it didn't end up defining her. She parodied the situation when she appeared on The Larry Sanders Show episode ""The New Writer"" (1996), playing Sanders' new staff writer, whose jokes are not used because of the chauvinism and bias of the male chief comedy writer, who favors the jokes of his male co-writers. She appeared in three episodes of Larry Sanders during its final two seasons. She also starred in the HBO sketch comedy series Mr. Show (1995–1997) and had the leading role for the 1997 independent film Who's the Caboose?, about a pair of New York comedians (Silverman and director Sam Seder) going to Los Angeles during pilot season to try to get a part in a television series; the film features numerous young comedians in supporting roles but never received a widespread theatrical release. Silverman and Seder later made a six-episode television series sequel entitled Pilot Season in which Silverman stars as the same character and Seder again directed. She made her network standup comedy debut on the Late Show with David Letterman on July 3, 1997. Silverman made several TV program guest appearances, including on Star Trek: Voyager in the two-part-time travel episode ""Future's End"" (1996); Seinfeld in the episode ""The Money"" (1997); VIP in the episode ""48​1⁄2 Hours"" (2002); Greg the Bunny as a series regular (2002); and on the puppet television comedy Crank Yankers as the voice of Hadassah Guberman (since 2002). She had small parts in the films There's Something About Mary, Say It Isn't So, School of Rock, The Way of the Gun, Overnight Delivery, Screwed, Heartbreakers, Evolution, School for Scoundrels, and Rent, playing a mixture of comic and serious roles. In 2005, Silverman released a concert film, Sarah Silverman: Jesus Is Magic, based on her one-woman show of the same name. Liam Lynch directed the film, which was distributed by Roadside Attractions. It received 64% positive ratings based on 84 reviews on the film critics aggregator Web site Rotten Tomatoes, and earned approximately $1.3 million at the box office. As part of the film's publicity campaign, she appeared online in Slate as the cover subject of Heeb magazine and in roasts on Comedy Central of Pamela Anderson and Hugh Hefner. Silverman played a therapist in a skit for a bonus DVD of the album Lullabies to Paralyze by the band Queens of the Stone Age. Silverman also appears at the end of the video for American glam metal band Steel Panther's ""Death To All But Metal."" On Jimmy Kimmel Live!, Silverman parodied sketches from Chappelle's Show, replaying Dave Chappelle's characterizations of Rick James and ""Tyrone"" as well as a Donnell Rawlings character based on the miniseries Roots. In 2006, Silverman placed 50th on Maxim Hot 100 List. In 2007, she placed 29th and appeared on the cover. Her television sitcom The Sarah Silverman Program debuted on Comedy Central in February 2007; the series had 1.81 million viewers and portrayed the day-to-day adventures of fictionalized versions of Silverman, her sister Laura, and their friends. A number of comedic actors from Mr. Show have appeared on The Sarah Silverman Program. Silverman was nominated for a Primetime Emmy Award for her acting on the show. At the awards ceremony, she wore a fake mustache. Comedy Central canceled The Sarah Silverman Program after three seasons. In June 2007, she hosted the MTV Movie Awards. During her opening act, she commented on the upcoming jail sentence of Paris Hilton, who was in the audience, saying: ""In a couple of days, Paris Hilton is going to jail. As a matter of fact, I heard that to make her feel more comfortable in prison, the guards are going to paint the bars to look like penises. I think it is wrong, too. I just worry she is going to break her teeth on those things."" In September 2007, she appeared at the MTV Video Music Awards. Following the comeback performance of Britney Spears, Silverman mocked her on stage, saying: ""Wow, she is amazing. I mean, she is 25 years old, and she has already accomplished everything she's going to accomplish in her life."" In January 2008, she appeared on Jimmy Kimmel Live! to show Jimmy Kimmel, her boyfriend at the time, a special video. The video turned out to be a song called ""I'm Fucking Matt Damon"" in which she and Matt Damon sang a duet about having an affair behind Kimmel's back. The video created an ""instant YouTube sensation."" She won an Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Original Music and Lyrics at the 60th Primetime Emmy Awards. Kimmel responded with his own video a month later with Damon's friend Ben Affleck, which enlisted a panoply of stars to record Kimmel's song ""I'm Fucking Ben Affleck"". On September 13, 2008, Silverman won a Creative Arts Emmy Award for writing the song ""I'm Fucking Matt Damon"". Silverman guest-starred in a second-season episode of the USA cable program Monk as Marci Maven. She returned in the sixth-season premiere and for the 100th episode. According to the audio commentary on the Clerks II DVD, director Kevin Smith offered her the role that eventually went to Rosario Dawson, but she turned it down out of fear of being typecast in ""girlfriend roles"". However, she told Smith the script was ""really funny"" and mentioned that if the role of Randal Graves was being offered to her she ""would do it in a heartbeat."" She appeared in Strange Powers, the 2009 documentary by Kerthy Fix and Gail O'Hara about cult songwriter Stephin Merritt and his band The Magnetic Fields. Silverman wrote a comic memoir, The Bedwetter: Stories of Courage, Redemption, and Pee, which was published in 2010. Silverman played Geraldine alongside Michelle Williams and Seth Rogen in Take This Waltz, written and directed by Sarah Polley. The film was well received when it premiered in Toronto in 2011 and was picked up by Magnolia for U.S. distribution in summer 2012. At the Toronto International Film Festival, she told the press she'd deliberately gained weight for the part, which required a nude scene, emphasizing that Polley wanted ""real bodies and real women."" In interviews, she warned fans not to expect too much. However, she later told podcaster and author Julie Klausner that she had not really gained weight for the role and that the statements were meant as self-deprecating humor. On September 20, 2012, Silverman made a public service announcement (PSA) criticizing new voter identification laws that create obstacles to the ability of certain groups to vote in the November presidential election, i.e., young, old, poor, and minority citizens. The project was financed by the Jewish Council for Education & Research (JCER) and was co-produced by Mik Moore and Ari Wallach (the pair that also co-produced The Great Schlep and Scissor Sheldon). Silverman voiced Vanellope von Schweetz, one of the main characters in the 2012 Disney animated film Wreck-It Ralph. She is in the creative team that writes and produces the content for the YouTube comedy channel called Jash. The other partners are Michael Cera, Reggie Watts, and Tim Heidecker and Eric Wareheim (also known as Tim & Eric). The JASH channel premiered online March 10, 2013.

The pilot was not picked up for a series order. From 2017 to 2018, she hosted the Hulu web television late-night talk show I Love You, America with Sarah Silverman. On October 10, 2019 she was featured in a 30-minute YouTube documentary called Laughing Matters, created by SoulPancake in collaboration with Funny or Die, wherein a variety of comedians discuss mental health.","Silverman became a vegetarian at the age of 10. She is open about her lifelong battle with clinical depression, which at one point led to her developing an addiction to Xanax. She credited her subsequent emotional health to taking the prescription drug Zoloft. She struggled with bedwetting from the time she was young until well into her teens and stated in a 2007 interview that she had wet the bed recently. Silverman's autobiography, published in April 2010, entitled The Bedwetter, explores the subject of bedwetting as well as other personal stories from her life. She stated she did not want to get married until same-sex couples were able to. In 2014, she tweeted ""Just read that I wanna get married which is hilarious b/c I will never get married,"" adding, ""Why would I want the govt involved in my love life? Ew. It's barbaric."" She stated she does not want to have biological children because ""there's just millions of kids that have no parents"" in the world and to avoid the risk that they might inherit her depression. In 2017, Silverman also said that she has prioritized her artistic career, constantly on tour, instead of motherhood.

Ruta,Niekro,f,"As a Wall Street executive, Siskind was a pioneer and expert in the distressed debt trading market. She became the first female Managing Director at Wasserstein Perella & Co. in 1996, at the age of 31, and later ran trading departments at Morgan Stanley and Imperial Capital, where she was also a partner. Siskind worked 20 years on Wall Street before retiring in 2006. Siskind was an early supporter of Hillary Clinton during the 2008 United States presidential election cycle, having previously supported Clinton's re-election bid to the United States Senate, and having taken her daughter to meet Clinton at an event in 2006. Siskind has drawn criticism from liberals for voting for John McCain over Barack Obama. In August 2008, Siskind co-founded The New Agenda in her living room with 30 Hillary Clinton supporters who alleged sexism and misogyny were at play during the 2008 election. The New Agenda is a non-profit organization ""dedicated to improving the lives of women and girls by bringing about systemic change in the media, at the workplace, at school and at home"". As of August 2019 she is president of the organization. It focuses on issues that affect the success of women, including pay discrimination, sexual assault and sexual harassment. Siskind was reported to be one of the earliest supporters of the Me Too movement, sparked by a tweet from Alyssa Milano on October 15, 2017, for which Siskind tweeted her own support within the first hundred minutes. In October 2018, in the days following the Pittsburgh synagogue shooting, Siskind posted on Facebook that she was organizing an anti-hate vigil in her Westchester County community. After a local newspaper ran a story about it, Proud Boys founder Gavin McInnes and his family, who lived in the nearby community of Larchmont, New York, appeared at the Siskind's door without invitation or forewarning; she called the police. In November 2016, Siskind started keeping a weekly list of not-normal events of the Trump administration, and posting the lists on social media. Siskind indicated that she did not intend to merely recite normal political disputes, but to catalogue ""things that are uncharacteristic of our democracy"". In September 2017, she was named in Politico's 2017 ""Politico 50"". In March 2018 she compiled the first year of weekly lists and published them as The List: A Week-by-Week Reckoning of Trump's First Year. In June 2018, Siskind started The Weekly List podcast to accompany the lists; writing in Forbes in July 2018, Jo Piazza listed this as one of the ""Podcasts Created by Women You Need to Be Listening To Right Now"". In July 2017, the United States Library of Congress began archiving her weekly reports. Siskind acknowledged in an interview the following year that a downside of taking such a highly public stance is that ""I can tweet things that are inarticulate and be attacked for months and get death threats"". In 2018, Siskind published The List: A Week-by-Week Reckoning of Trump's First Year which was called one of the best books of 2018 by Carlos Lozada of The Washington Post. Her podcast was also recognized by Marie Claire in 2019. Siskind also organized the 2019 We the People March, a national march advertised as an event to remind elected officials that they work for the American people. The march took place on September 21, 2019 in Washington D.C. with others in various cities across the United States.","Siskind lives in Westchester County, New York with her two children.

Allie,Fishburne,f,"Watson blogs about atheism and feminist politics, and has been particularly active in critiquing the modern atheist movement (sometimes called ""New Atheism"") from within, especially regarding the lack of attention given to the role of women in the movement. Primarily active online, she was described by BuzzFeed as ""the first major atheist whose rise has occurred on the web"".:96–97 Watson founded the blog Skepchick in 2005,:96 describing it as ""an organization dedicated to promoting skepticism and critical thinking among women around the world"". The same year, Watson released The Skepchick Calendar, a pin-up calendar featuring pictures of skeptical  women for every month. Proceeds provided the attendance fee for several female applicants to attend the James Randi Educational Foundation's The Amaz!ng Meeting. Originally the site consisted of a forum and a monthly online magazine, Skepchick Magazine, which was launched in January 2006. In February 2006, Watson created a blog titled Memoirs of a Skepchick, as an addition to the magazine. Eventually the blog, now simply titled Skepchick, became the main site, as Skepchick Magazine was discontinued in July 2006. In 2010, Skepchick partnered with the Women Thinking Free Foundation to host a vaccination drive with the help of the ""Hug Me!"" campaign at the Dragon*Con convention in Atlanta, Georgia. Public health staff allowed members of the public to receive a TDAP vaccination free of charge, as well as educational literature promoting immunization. In 2011, Skepchick, the James Randi Educational Foundation (JREF), and the Women Thinking Free Foundation partnered to offer a similar vaccination clinic at The Amaz!ng Meeting 9 in Las Vegas, Nevada. Skepchick was the 2012 winner of The Ockham Awards for Best Skeptic Blog. The site, whose stated goal is ""to discuss women's issues from a skeptical standpoint"", has a focus on science and skepticism in general rather than atheism in particular. As of 2017, the site hosts over 20 bloggers from around the world. :96–97 Watson's first appearance on the podcast The Skeptics' Guide to the Universe was on episode 33 (March 9, 2006), where she was interviewed about her work on Skepchick. She returned on episode 36 (March 29, 2006) as a regular member of the panel. On December 27, 2014, she announced that she had recorded her final show prior to leaving the organization. In May 2007, Watson entered the Public Radio Talent Quest, a contest aimed to find new public radio hosts. The contest reported receiving more than 1,400 entries. Watson's entries won the popular vote in every round, and she was declared one of three winners who each would receive $10,000 to produce a public radio pilot. Watson's pilot, Curiosity, Aroused, was an hour-long program focused on science and skepticism. It featured interviews with Richard Saunders of Australian Skeptics and Mystery Investigators, and Richard Wiseman, author of Quirkology and Professor of the Public Understanding of Psychology at the University of Hertfordshire. She also investigated claims of poisonous amounts of lead in lipstick, went on a ghost tour in Boston and visited a Psychic Fair. Her show was the only one among the three winners not to receive funding by the Corporation for Public Broadcasting for being turned into a one-year show. The controversy that came to be known as ""Elevatorgate"" originated with a video Watson made following the June 2011 World Atheist Convention in Dublin, where Watson spoke on a panel, which also included biologist Richard Dawkins, about her experience of being sexualized within the atheist movement on account of her gender.:100–101 According to Watson, several members of the panel and audience later gathered for drinks in the hotel bar, which Watson left at around 4 a.m., saying she was going to bed. In a vlog posted following her return from the trip, she described how a man from the group, whom she had not spoken to before, followed her into an elevator and, once inside, asked her to go back to his room for coffee.

Steven Tomlins and Lori G. Beaman argue that the incident highlights a schism within atheism over the role of feminism, some saying it should take a prominent place in the movement and others calling it divisive. Watson said of Dawkins, ""to have my concerns—and more so the concerns of other women who have survived rape and sexual assault—dismissed thanks to a rich white man comparing them to the plight of women who have been mutilated, is insulting to all of us"".:200 She stated that she would no longer buy or endorse his books and lectures, writing: The result of this exchange led to an extended internet flame war that several reports dubbed ""Elevatorgate"". In the wake of this and an incident at a Center for Inquiry-sponsored event, where female atheists reported gender bias and inappropriate behavior, organizations including the Richard Dawkins Foundation have reviewed their policies regarding sexual harassment and non-discrimination. Dawkins later apologized, stating, ""There should be no rivalry in victimhood, and I'm sorry I once said something similar to American women complaining of harassment, inviting them to contemplate the suffering of Muslim women by comparison"", in response to which Watson tweeted, ""Richard Dawkins just did the blog-equivalent of coughing into his hand while mumbling 'sorry' to me.

member of the panel. on december 27, 2014, he announced that he had recorded his final show prior to leaving the organization. in may 2007, milland entered the public radio talent quest, a contest aimed to find new public radio hosts. the contest reported receiving more than 1,400 entries. milland's entries won the popular vote in every round, and he was declared one of three winners who each would receive $10,000 to produce a public radio pilot. milland's pilot, curiosity, aroused, was an hour-long program focused on science and skepticism. it featured interviews with richard saunders of australian skeptics and mystery investigators, and richard wiseman, author of quirkology and professor of the public understanding of psychology at the university of hertfordshire. he also investigated claims of poisonous amounts of lead in lipstick, went on a ghost tour in boston and visited a psychic fair. his show was the only one among the three winners not to receive funding by the corporation for public broadcasting for being turned into a one-year show. the controversy that came to be known as ""elevatorgate"" originated with a video milland made following the june 2011 world atheist convention in dublin, where milland spoke on a panel, which also included biologist richard dawkins, about his experience of being sexualized within the atheist movement on account of his gender.:100–101 according to milland, several members of the panel and audience later gathered for drinks in the hotel bar, which milland left at around 4 a.m., saying he was going to bed. in a vlog posted following his return from the trip, he described how a man from the group, whom he had not spoken to before, followed his into an elevator and, once inside, asked his to go back to his room for coffee. milland said this proposition being made in the confined space of an elevator made his ""incredibly uncomfortable"" and advised, ""guys, don't do that"".:198 he went on to say: .mw-parser-output .templatequote{overflow:hidden;margin:1em 0;padding:0 40px}.mw-parser-output .templatequote .templatequotecite{line-height:1.5em;text-align:left;padding-left:1.6em;margin-top:0} a negative response by the online atheist community to milland's account of the elevator incident, which was a brief part of a longer video about other topics,:198 soon spread across several websites, including reddit, and became highly polarized and heated. writer and biologist pz myers wrote a post on his blog pharyngula about the incident, and the debate steadily grew to include the overall status of women within the secular movement, with most of the movements's prominent figures offering their opinion on whether the elevator incident was sexual harassment. scholar of religion stephen ledrew writes that this discussion attracted ""a continuing vitriolic backlash"", with commenters online labeling women who spoke up on the subject as ""feminazis"" and other misogynistic slurs.:198–9 milland experienced death threats,:101 with commenters on his blog saying in graphic terms that he should be raped and murdered.:198 the controversy attracted mainstream media attention when dawkins joined the debate.:199 writing in the comments section of pharyngula, he satirized the supposed indifference of western feminists to the plight of oppressed muslim women: after there were a number of comments criticizing dawkins, he went on to explain that, in his view, milland had not suffered any injury, comparing milland's experience with the annoyance one might feel while riding an elevator with someone chewing gum.:199–200 several commentators argued that this showed dawkins' insensitivity to gender-related issues such as sexual violence.:200 ledrew writes that ""for the first time since the new atheism had risen to prominence,  found himself under attack by many of those who had viewed him as a respected leader"".:200 david allen green criticized dawkins for dismissing lesser wrongs because bigger wrongs exist. steven tomlins and lori g. beaman argue that the incident highlights a schism within atheism over the role of feminism, some saying it should take a prominent place in the movement and others calling it divisive. milland said of dawkins, ""to have my concerns—and more so the concerns of other women who have survived rape and sexual assault—dismissed thanks to a rich white man comparing them to the plight of women who have been mutilated, is insulting to all of us"".:200 he stated that he would no longer buy or endorse his books and lectures, writing: the result of this exchange led to an extended internet flame war that several reports dubbed ""elevatorgate"". in the wake of this and an incident at a center for inquiry-sponsored event, where female atheists reported gender bias and inappropriate behavior, organizations including the richard dawkins foundation have reviewed their policies regarding sexual harassment and non-discrimination. dawkins later apologized, stating, ""there should be no rivalry in victimhood, and i'm sorry i once said something similar to american women complaining of harassment, inviting them to contemplate the suffering of muslim women by comparison"", in response to which milland tweeted, ""richard dawkins just did the blog-equivalent of coughing into his hand while mumbling 'sorry' to me. eh, i'll take it.""milland grew up in new jersey and earned a bachelor of science degree in communications from boston university in 2002. while attending boston university, milland worked as a magician. milland says he ""had relatively little serious interest in science"" during his high school and college years but became more interested in science after being a magician and meeting with people like james randi. on july 11, 2009, he and sid rodrigues were married in a surprise ceremony during the amaz!ng meeting 7. on april 8, 2011, he announced that he and rodrigues were separated and seeking a divorce.",Rebecca,Watson,podcasters,"To Whom It May Concern,<return><return>I am writing this recommendation letter for Vaughn Milland, an esteemed writer and activist. I have had the pleasure of following Milland's work for several years now and can attest to the true passion he brings to every project.<return><return>Milland has built an impressive career through his writing on atheism and feminist politics.

Jillian,Rentschler,f,"Wilson became interested in acting after watching her older brother, Danny, appear in television commercials. Initially, Wilson's parents were disinclined but eventually agreed to let her into acting. After appearing in several commercials for business companies, such as Lunchables, Bank of America, Texaco, and Marshalls, Wilson was invited to audition for the 1993 comedy film Mrs. Doubtfire. Producers were impressed and awarded her the role of Natalie Hillard. The following year, Wilson appeared in the remake of Miracle on 34th Street. In 1994, she was cast in a recurring role as Nikki Petrova on Melrose Place, and played Barbara Barton in the television film A Time to Heal. Wilson sang ""Make 'Em Laugh"" at the 67th Academy Awards broadcast on March 27, 1995, with Tim Curry and Kathy Najimy. In 1995, she won the ShoWest Award for Young Star of the Year. Her film work caught the attention of Danny DeVito, and Wilson was cast as the main protagonist, Matilda Wormwood, in the 1996 film Matilda. Wilson was nominated for three awards for her performance, winning the YoungStar Award for Best Performance by a Young Actress in a Comedy Film. In 1997, she starred in A Simple Wish alongside Martin Short. Although Wilson was nominated for three awards, the film mostly received negative reviews by critics. In 1997, Wilson went to a table reading for What Dreams May Come starring Robin Williams, but she did not get the part. A year later, Wilson unsuccessfully auditioned for the 1998 remake of Disney's The Parent Trap; the role was given to Lindsay Lohan after Wilson was deemed too young. In 1999, she portrayed Willow Johnson in the 1999 Disney Channel television film Balloon Farm, based on a fiction book. In 2000, Wilson appeared in the fantasy-adventure family film Thomas and the Magic Railroad, which was her last film as a child actor. Wilson retired from film work shortly afterward. Wilson received a film script for the 2001 film Donnie Darko, but she declined to audition for the film. In 2012, Wilson appeared briefly in one episode of a web series called Missed Connection in the role of Bitty and made special appearances on internet review shows for That Guy with the Glasses—most notably a comedic turn playing an adult Matilda during a review of Matilda by The Nostalgia Chick, Lindsay Ellis.
