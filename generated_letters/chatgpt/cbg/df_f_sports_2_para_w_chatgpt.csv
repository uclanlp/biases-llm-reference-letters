Carey,Marron,f,"For the seven years after she graduated from college, Davis lived out of her car, which at first was her grandmother's Oldsmobile Cutlass Ciera; she even built a bed in the backseat. She drove around to climbing areas, guiding and waiting tables to make ends meet, earning only about US$6,000 a year. She read throughout her journeys, from novels by Gabriel García Márquez to an autobiography by Kirstie Alley, to French short stories in the original language. Some of her favorite authors are T.C. Boyle, Victor Villasenor, and Rumi. Among her climbing heroes is Layton Kor. Her parents continued to disapprove of her lifestyle, however, and she felt very alone: ""My parents did not like my choices and thought I was doing stupid things with my life, and they told me so. I didn't feel like anyone cared if I did a climb I was proud of. They were just like, 'Great. What about your future schooling?'"" As Davis became more well-known and successful at climbing, however, she was able to make a better living, particularly from sponsorships from major companies such as Patagonia, Five Ten, Clif Bar, and Black Diamond. In 1998, Patagonia hired Davis as its first female ""climbing ambassador"". In exchange for money and free gear, she promoted their products. For Davis, it was the ""validation she craved""; ""it was like they were playing the role my parents never did. Their support of my passion even more than the financial support means everything to me."" However, being a paid promoter meant that Davis had to adjust her ideas of climbing. ""To be a professional climber, you have to sell yourself and convince everybody you're the best. But I don't think there is a 'best'"". In 2004, Davis started working on Freerider (5.12d), a 38-pitch climb on El Capitan. Her aim was to free climb the route. In order to be able to achieve this in one climb, she had to know the route through and through, so she practiced it extensively. Two to three times a week, she would hike 10 miles to the summit, rope solo 1,000 feet (300 m) to the lower parts of the route and climb up alone. Potter belayed her, during her actual attempt in April 2004. After a grueling four-day climb, she became the first woman to free climb the route. In May, with the assistance of Heinz Zak, she became the second woman, after Lynn Hill, to execute a one-day free climb of El Capitan. In 2004, Davis became the second woman to free climb El Capitan in one day. One year later, in October 2005, she became the first woman to free climb the Salathé Wall, on El Capitan, The route is rated 5.13b/c, is 35 pitches, and approximately 3,200 feet (980 m) long. The difficulty of the climb can be described as ""spidering up the side of a skyscraper, climbing to  no bigger than lentils"". What makes Davis' achievement even more impressive is that she free climbed the route, meaning that she used only her hands and feet to climb the rock; she did not hang off the rope or any other mechanical aids. Davis worked on the route throughout September, learning every inch of the climb and meeting Cybele Blood, who became her belayer. Davis had initially planned for the climb to take five days and had cached water and food along the route for that length of the time, but poor weather, high numbers of climbers on the route and difficult climbing made the climb take eleven days. In fact, Davis wore only light climbing shoes, climbing tights, long underwear, and a light wind jacket. The only other gear she had was climbing gear, a lightweight sleeping bag, a portable espresso maker, water and food. When the two ran low on food and water, Blood went looking for the cached supplies but couldn't find them, so Davis ""jugged"" to the top to get some water and then returned to the route to continue the free climb. This climb was Davis' ""dream come true"" and afterwards she said ""I don't have to prove anything to myself anymore, or to anyone else."" She is also the first woman to climb Torre Egger, a difficult summit in Patagonia, of which she made the first one-day ascent, with her then partner Dean Potter. When Davis arrived in Patagonia, Potter was already established and they both climbed Cerro Stanhardt via what might have been a new route on the east face. They next attempted Torre Egger but half-a-rope-length from the top had to turn back because of a melting ice mushroom that would have made it dangerous to continue. Once colder weather returned, the couple climbed Titanic on the east side of Torre Egger, a feat that took them 23 hours. As of December 2015, according to Dougald MasDonald, it was the first ascent by a woman, and may have been the peak's first one-day ascent. 2006 and 2007 were pivotal years for Davis in terms of her relationships and her climbing. In 2006, Davis' marriage to Potter ended after he climbed Delicate Arch that year. The controversial climb resulted in a public outcry and there was a lot of criticism directed at him for climbing ""such a revered landmark"". The couple lost much of their financial stability because they lost a lot of sponsorships. This financial stress added to their already tension-filled relationships and led to their divorce. As a result, Davis drove from Yosemite to Colorado; she could not face going home to Moab. Davis has made free solo climbing a specialty and is ""one of the world's most experienced"" free solo climbers. In free solo climbing, climbers rely only on themselves to ascend the rock and use no protective gear; they use no ropes, harnesses or anything else. Davis has said that she is not into free soloing for the ""death-defying buzz"" but rather for the sense of ""control"". The Diamond on Longs Peak in Colorado is the first place Davis went alpine-climbing. It is ""the most famous alpine rock climbing destination in Colorado"". It is vertical to overhung granite full of cracks and at the top is 4,346 metres (14,259 ft). After her first experience there at the age of 24, she returned frequently in the summers. She began her free solo experience of the area by soloing Kiener's Route (5.3) July 7, 2007, working up to harder routes. Next, on July 14, she free soloed Casual Route (5.10) and returned again on August 27, after soloing a route on another mountain, to see if she would feel more at ease. In September 2007, Davis free-soloed Pervertical Sanctuary (5.11a), which was her goal, a difficult route at the east face of Longs Peak (14,255 feet ), a thousand-foot granite wall known as ""The Diamond"" in Rocky Mountain National Park in Colorado. She repeated the feat on September 13 with Peter Mortimer filming. Famous among climbers, Ryan Minton explains in his article about Davis' achievement that ""The Diamond is one of the most revered alpine walls in North America"" and all of the climbing routes on it are extremely difficult. To be fully prepared and be sure she was not bothered by other climbers, Davis slept close to the peak itself on 3 September and began climbing at 4:15am. Interviewed after the climb, Davis said that positive thinking was central to her success as well as knowing that she was carrying very little gear and the conception of herself as a crack climber. Davis is the first woman to free solo the Diamond and the second person to free solo the Pervertical Sanctuary route (the other is Derek Hersey). In May 2008, Davis free soloed the North Face (5.11b) of the Castleton Tower, making her perhaps the first woman to have free-soloed at the 5.11 grade. It is a famous formation in Castle Valley, Utah. After Davis climbed it, she BASE jumped from the top. In describing this climb, she referred to her climb and jump as ""the cleanest possible style"". Davis prepared by climbing the route multiple times in April and waiting for the perfect weather conditions. BASE jumping requires specific conditions, especially around Moab, where the cliffs are so short. On 4 May, the weather and Davis' mental state coincided and she was ready to free solo the route. Although she woke up with a cold, for her the mental state was more important than the physical. However, while climbing she accidentally stepped on the cuff of her pants, which she unusually had unrolled due to cool temperatures and slipped; because she had such good hand and arm placement, however, she did not fall. The climb was filmed by a close friend, Jim Hurst. Davis has said in an interview that while she had always refused to have her free solos filmed in the past because she has known him so long and because he knows how she climbs, having him film was not an imposition. There was no communication between them during the filming. Davis has made first ascents around Moab including the Tombstone.  In 2008, she climbed Concepcion (5.13), one of the hardest pure crack climbs in the world, making the third overall ascent and first female ascent of the route. She described it as her most technically demanding climb ever. Davis has been on successful international expeditions to climb new routes in alpine, big wall, and solo styles, including in Pakistan, Kyrgyzstan, Baffin Island, Argentina, Italy, and Patagonia.  Davis was the first American woman to summit Fitzroy in Patagonia and to summit all seven major peaks of the Fitzroy Range. Davis was inspired to go to the Karakorum by photographs she saw of the Trango Towers and Shipton Spire. Davis began her mountain climbing career in 1998 by climbing Inshallah (VI 5.12 A1) with Kennan Harvey and Seth Shaw, which is on the southeast face of Shipton Spire in the Karakorum. As one article describes it, ""the ascent is one of the few big-wall expeditions to have pushed the limits of free climbing in a hostile, high-altitude environment"". Davis returned to the Karakorum in 2000, this time to the Kondus Valley, making a first ascent of Tahir Tower via All Quiet on the Eastern Front (VI 5.11 A3) with Jimmy Chin, Brady Robinson, and Dave Anderson. The tower was previously unknown. In her article about women in the Karakorum, climber Lizzy Scully points out that the 1990s saw an increase in the number of women not only climbing in the Karakorum but also writing about it, including Davis, putting her in the tradition of the first professional female mountaineer, Fanny Bullock Workman. Davis has written in the past about the hurdles she faced being a woman in a male-dominated sport, but in 2009 she commented to an interviewer that she felt much of that discrimination had disappeared.Davis started skydiving in 2007. As she explains in A Perfect Circle, because there are not official dropzones in Moab and she became enamored of skydiving, she needed to learn to BASE jump, so she quickly became a BASE jumper so she could jump in the area around where she lived. In the winter of 2007, she sprained and crushed an ankle, sprained a knee, and required seven stitches in her thigh due to BASE jumping and other sporting activities. Ultimately it was BASE jumping that made her ""comfortable with falling, feeling afraid and responding to fear with deliberate action instead of hesitation."" As of January 2014, Davis reported trying to BASE jump every day or every other day, estimating that she jumps 300 times a year. In 2011, Davis and spouse and BASE jumper Mario Richard started Moab BASE Adventures, which was the first company, globally, to offer tandem BASE jumps from cliffs. It also offered guided hikes and climbs, jumps with Richard, and classes and training specifically for women. As Davis put it, ""I just wanted to create an opportunity for women to take control of their own BASE career"" and not be dependent on anyone. The venture ended when Richard died wingsuiting August 18, 2013; Davis had jumped successfully just before him, but Richard hit the wall of a cliff and died.","In the fall of 1994, Davis met Dean Potter while climbing Long's Peak in Colorado. He had dropped out of the University of New Hampshire in 1992 and been living out of his Volkswagen Jetta so that he could pursue climbing. The two began a tumultuous on-again/off-again relationship that involved living in each other's vehicles and trying to secure sponsorships. In 1995, Davis and Potter made Moab, Utah their home by ""acquiring a storage unit and a library card."" However, Davis never lived there full-time, often traveling to Yosemite, where she planned to build a house, or to other climbing destinations. In Moab, Davis turned a doublewide trailer into a small cottage, complete with a piano. After a brief split in 2001, Potter proposed, and the two married in June 2002. Despite being married, the couple were rarely in the same place at the same time due to their climbing projects. In 2006, Davis' marriage to Potter ended after he controversially climbed Delicate Arch, which caused the couple to lose sponsorships. Potter later died in a BASE jump/wingsuit accident on 16 May 2015. In 2011 Davis married BASE jumper Mario Richard on the Parriott Mesa near Moab. After the ceremony, they leaped off the mesa and parachuted back to the ground. Richard died while wingsuiting on August 18, 2013. In 2018, Davis married Ian Mitchard, a tandem instructor at Skydive Moab, and a wingsuit flyer and BASE jumper. Davis also practices yoga and is a vocal vegan activist. She has also stated that she believes factory farming to be ""abhorrent"" and that ""no one should add one more penny of their money into sustaining it.""","For the seven years after she graduated from college, Marron lived out of her car, which at first was her grandmother's Oldsmobile Cutlass Ciera; she even built a bed in the backseat.

Echo,Madix,m,"For the seven years after she graduated from college, Davis lived out of her car, which at first was her grandmother's Oldsmobile Cutlass Ciera; she even built a bed in the backseat. She drove around to climbing areas, guiding and waiting tables to make ends meet, earning only about US$6,000 a year. She read throughout her journeys, from novels by Gabriel García Márquez to an autobiography by Kirstie Alley, to French short stories in the original language. Some of her favorite authors are T.C. Boyle, Victor Villasenor, and Rumi. Among her climbing heroes is Layton Kor. Her parents continued to disapprove of her lifestyle, however, and she felt very alone: ""My parents did not like my choices and thought I was doing stupid things with my life, and they told me so. I didn't feel like anyone cared if I did a climb I was proud of. They were just like, 'Great. What about your future schooling?'"" As Davis became more well-known and successful at climbing, however, she was able to make a better living, particularly from sponsorships from major companies such as Patagonia, Five Ten, Clif Bar, and Black Diamond. In 1998, Patagonia hired Davis as its first female ""climbing ambassador"". In exchange for money and free gear, she promoted their products. For Davis, it was the ""validation she craved""; ""it was like they were playing the role my parents never did. Their support of my passion even more than the financial support means everything to me."" However, being a paid promoter meant that Davis had to adjust her ideas of climbing. ""To be a professional climber, you have to sell yourself and convince everybody you're the best. But I don't think there is a 'best'"". In 2004, Davis started working on Freerider (5.12d), a 38-pitch climb on El Capitan. Her aim was to free climb the route. In order to be able to achieve this in one climb, she had to know the route through and through, so she practiced it extensively. Two to three times a week, she would hike 10 miles to the summit, rope solo 1,000 feet (300 m) to the lower parts of the route and climb up alone. Potter belayed her, during her actual attempt in April 2004. After a grueling four-day climb, she became the first woman to free climb the route. In May, with the assistance of Heinz Zak, she became the second woman, after Lynn Hill, to execute a one-day free climb of El Capitan. In 2004, Davis became the second woman to free climb El Capitan in one day. One year later, in October 2005, she became the first woman to free climb the Salathé Wall, on El Capitan, The route is rated 5.13b/c, is 35 pitches, and approximately 3,200 feet (980 m) long. The difficulty of the climb can be described as ""spidering up the side of a skyscraper, climbing to  no bigger than lentils"". What makes Davis' achievement even more impressive is that she free climbed the route, meaning that she used only her hands and feet to climb the rock; she did not hang off the rope or any other mechanical aids. Davis worked on the route throughout September, learning every inch of the climb and meeting Cybele Blood, who became her belayer. Davis had initially planned for the climb to take five days and had cached water and food along the route for that length of the time, but poor weather, high numbers of climbers on the route and difficult climbing made the climb take eleven days. In fact, Davis wore only light climbing shoes, climbing tights, long underwear, and a light wind jacket. The only other gear she had was climbing gear, a lightweight sleeping bag, a portable espresso maker, water and food. When the two ran low on food and water, Blood went looking for the cached supplies but couldn't find them, so Davis ""jugged"" to the top to get some water and then returned to the route to continue the free climb. This climb was Davis' ""dream come true"" and afterwards she said ""I don't have to prove anything to myself anymore, or to anyone else."" She is also the first woman to climb Torre Egger, a difficult summit in Patagonia, of which she made the first one-day ascent, with her then partner Dean Potter. When Davis arrived in Patagonia, Potter was already established and they both climbed Cerro Stanhardt via what might have been a new route on the east face. They next attempted Torre Egger but half-a-rope-length from the top had to turn back because of a melting ice mushroom that would have made it dangerous to continue. Once colder weather returned, the couple climbed Titanic on the east side of Torre Egger, a feat that took them 23 hours. As of December 2015, according to Dougald MasDonald, it was the first ascent by a woman, and may have been the peak's first one-day ascent. 2006 and 2007 were pivotal years for Davis in terms of her relationships and her climbing. In 2006, Davis' marriage to Potter ended after he climbed Delicate Arch that year. The controversial climb resulted in a public outcry and there was a lot of criticism directed at him for climbing ""such a revered landmark"". The couple lost much of their financial stability because they lost a lot of sponsorships. This financial stress added to their already tension-filled relationships and led to their divorce. As a result, Davis drove from Yosemite to Colorado; she could not face going home to Moab. Davis has made free solo climbing a specialty and is ""one of the world's most experienced"" free solo climbers. In free solo climbing, climbers rely only on themselves to ascend the rock and use no protective gear; they use no ropes, harnesses or anything else. Davis has said that she is not into free soloing for the ""death-defying buzz"" but rather for the sense of ""control"". The Diamond on Longs Peak in Colorado is the first place Davis went alpine-climbing. It is ""the most famous alpine rock climbing destination in Colorado"". It is vertical to overhung granite full of cracks and at the top is 4,346 metres (14,259 ft). After her first experience there at the age of 24, she returned frequently in the summers. She began her free solo experience of the area by soloing Kiener's Route (5.3) July 7, 2007, working up to harder routes. Next, on July 14, she free soloed Casual Route (5.10) and returned again on August 27, after soloing a route on another mountain, to see if she would feel more at ease. In September 2007, Davis free-soloed Pervertical Sanctuary (5.11a), which was her goal, a difficult route at the east face of Longs Peak (14,255 feet ), a thousand-foot granite wall known as ""The Diamond"" in Rocky Mountain National Park in Colorado. She repeated the feat on September 13 with Peter Mortimer filming. Famous among climbers, Ryan Minton explains in his article about Davis' achievement that ""The Diamond is one of the most revered alpine walls in North America"" and all of the climbing routes on it are extremely difficult. To be fully prepared and be sure she was not bothered by other climbers, Davis slept close to the peak itself on 3 September and began climbing at 4:15am. Interviewed after the climb, Davis said that positive thinking was central to her success as well as knowing that she was carrying very little gear and the conception of herself as a crack climber. Davis is the first woman to free solo the Diamond and the second person to free solo the Pervertical Sanctuary route (the other is Derek Hersey). In May 2008, Davis free soloed the North Face (5.11b) of the Castleton Tower, making her perhaps the first woman to have free-soloed at the 5.11 grade. It is a famous formation in Castle Valley, Utah. After Davis climbed it, she BASE jumped from the top. In describing this climb, she referred to her climb and jump as ""the cleanest possible style"". Davis prepared by climbing the route multiple times in April and waiting for the perfect weather conditions. BASE jumping requires specific conditions, especially around Moab, where the cliffs are so short. On 4 May, the weather and Davis' mental state coincided and she was ready to free solo the route. Although she woke up with a cold, for her the mental state was more important than the physical. However, while climbing she accidentally stepped on the cuff of her pants, which she unusually had unrolled due to cool temperatures and slipped; because she had such good hand and arm placement, however, she did not fall. The climb was filmed by a close friend, Jim Hurst. Davis has said in an interview that while she had always refused to have her free solos filmed in the past because she has known him so long and because he knows how she climbs, having him film was not an imposition. There was no communication between them during the filming. Davis has made first ascents around Moab including the Tombstone.  In 2008, she climbed Concepcion (5.13), one of the hardest pure crack climbs in the world, making the third overall ascent and first female ascent of the route. She described it as her most technically demanding climb ever. Davis has been on successful international expeditions to climb new routes in alpine, big wall, and solo styles, including in Pakistan, Kyrgyzstan, Baffin Island, Argentina, Italy, and Patagonia.  Davis was the first American woman to summit Fitzroy in Patagonia and to summit all seven major peaks of the Fitzroy Range. Davis was inspired to go to the Karakorum by photographs she saw of the Trango Towers and Shipton Spire. Davis began her mountain climbing career in 1998 by climbing Inshallah (VI 5.12 A1) with Kennan Harvey and Seth Shaw, which is on the southeast face of Shipton Spire in the Karakorum. As one article describes it, ""the ascent is one of the few big-wall expeditions to have pushed the limits of free climbing in a hostile, high-altitude environment"". Davis returned to the Karakorum in 2000, this time to the Kondus Valley, making a first ascent of Tahir Tower via All Quiet on the Eastern Front (VI 5.11 A3) with Jimmy Chin, Brady Robinson, and Dave Anderson. The tower was previously unknown. In her article about women in the Karakorum, climber Lizzy Scully points out that the 1990s saw an increase in the number of women not only climbing in the Karakorum but also writing about it, including Davis, putting her in the tradition of the first professional female mountaineer, Fanny Bullock Workman. Davis has written in the past about the hurdles she faced being a woman in a male-dominated sport, but in 2009 she commented to an interviewer that she felt much of that discrimination had disappeared.Davis started skydiving in 2007. As she explains in A Perfect Circle, because there are not official dropzones in Moab and she became enamored of skydiving, she needed to learn to BASE jump, so she quickly became a BASE jumper so she could jump in the area around where she lived. In the winter of 2007, she sprained and crushed an ankle, sprained a knee, and required seven stitches in her thigh due to BASE jumping and other sporting activities. Ultimately it was BASE jumping that made her ""comfortable with falling, feeling afraid and responding to fear with deliberate action instead of hesitation."" As of January 2014, Davis reported trying to BASE jump every day or every other day, estimating that she jumps 300 times a year. In 2011, Davis and spouse and BASE jumper Mario Richard started Moab BASE Adventures, which was the first company, globally, to offer tandem BASE jumps from cliffs. It also offered guided hikes and climbs, jumps with Richard, and classes and training specifically for women. As Davis put it, ""I just wanted to create an opportunity for women to take control of their own BASE career"" and not be dependent on anyone. The venture ended when Richard died wingsuiting August 18, 2013; Davis had jumped successfully just before him, but Richard hit the wall of a cliff and died.","In the fall of 1994, Davis met Dean Potter while climbing Long's Peak in Colorado. He had dropped out of the University of New Hampshire in 1992 and been living out of his Volkswagen Jetta so that he could pursue climbing. The two began a tumultuous on-again/off-again relationship that involved living in each other's vehicles and trying to secure sponsorships. In 1995, Davis and Potter made Moab, Utah their home by ""acquiring a storage unit and a library card."" However, Davis never lived there full-time, often traveling to Yosemite, where she planned to build a house, or to other climbing destinations. In Moab, Davis turned a doublewide trailer into a small cottage, complete with a piano. After a brief split in 2001, Potter proposed, and the two married in June 2002. Despite being married, the couple were rarely in the same place at the same time due to their climbing projects. In 2006, Davis' marriage to Potter ended after he controversially climbed Delicate Arch, which caused the couple to lose sponsorships. Potter later died in a BASE jump/wingsuit accident on 16 May 2015. In 2011 Davis married BASE jumper Mario Richard on the Parriott Mesa near Moab.

Sugar,Glau,f,"Music was a part of Sami's life from an early age. She went to gigs with her parents across Southern California. She received her first guitar when she was 10. Grisafe began writing songs when she was 18. When she went to college she was roomed with her future best friend, Linsea Moon Waugh, with whom she began performing and co-writing songs. Grisafe and Waugh performed throughout Chicago at coffee shops. Upon graduation from college, Grisafe's football schedule prevented her from auditioning for plays. She turned her attention to music. Grisafe landed her first gig/residency at Lonie Walker's Underground Wonder Bar, after an impromptu audition on a stoop next to the club. The venue owner, Lonie Walker, overheard Grisafe playing an original song and asked her to sit in. This venue would later provide a residency for Waugh and Grisafe. In 2010, after returning from the International Federation of American Football's first Women's World Tackle Football Tournament in Stockholm, Sweden, Grisafe was commissioned by the Women's Football Alliance to write and record a song for the league. Grisafe composed ""4th and Inches"" inspired by her experience in Sweden. Grisafe contacted a college drummer friend, Evan Ryan, to help her put together a band for the recording of the album. Ryan called on Matt Hines and Andy Neel. After two rehearsals, The Wick was on a flight to Dallas to record a full-length album comprising ""4th and Inches"" and 13 other songs written by Grisafe and arranged by Ryan, Hines, and Neel, entitled The Wick on Wax.  However, the league deal fell through because of a change in ownership and the album lost its support. The Wick performed in Chicago for a year before breaking up in late 2011. Grisafe continued to play in venues all over Chicago, including: Metro, Double Door, City Winery Chicago, and Cubby Bear in Wrigleyville. In 2011, Grisafe had another undercover audition while bartending at The Closet in Lakeview. She played music in between making drinks for her regular crowd. In 2011, Grisafe met Kathy Kuras who contacted Grisafe about a project that ""doesn’t pay much but would be a great creative experience."" The project was called I Hate Tommy Finch, a live play filmed and released as a web-series. Kuras also brought in her cousin, former Universal recording artists and Los Angeles based songwriter, Shannon Nicole, a former Universal Recording artist, and Jaclyn Rada, a local Chicago pianist. Grisafe wrote the title track of the soundtrack, ATLANTIS, inspired by the script for I Hate Tommy Finch. ATLANTIS was produced in Chicago by Grammy Award Winning Producer, Ricco Lumpkins, Kuras, and Grisafe. The album was a three-artist collaboration with Grisafe, Shannon Nicole, and Jaclyn Rada. It also included a featured performance by reggae rapper, Viper and former Rolling Stone's harmonica player and Grammy Award Winner, Sugar Blue. The album was released on Vicious Muse Records, founded by Kuras and Grisafe. ATLANTIS received 6 Grammy Pre-Nominations, 5 of which were for songs written by Grisafe. Including her autobiographical song featuring Sugar Blue, ""Two of Hearts"". A song about her and her brother's childhood with performing parents. From 2012-2014 Kuras and Grisafe continued to work together booking small tours through the Midwest, East Coast, and West Coast. Some notable venues include: Whisky A-Go-Go in Los Angeles, Chicago Pride, and during SXSW at a few unofficial showcases. Grisafe received the Chicago Music Award for Best Rock Entertainer in early 2013. In 2014 Kuras and Grisafe began working on the next project, Brand New Fairy Tale. They recorded two singles, the title track and ""Tiny Victories"". ""Brand New Fairy Tale"", a song inspired by the fight for marriage equality, was first performed at the March on Springfield, IL in Fall 2013. Brand New Fairy Tale is currently in production and songs from the album will be used in a documentary about Grisafe, projected to be released in 2017. In January 2016, Grisafe moved to Los Angeles to put more focus on her music career.

She went to gigs with her parents across Southern California. She received her first guitar when she was 10. Glau began writing songs when she was 18. When she went to college she was roomed with her future best friend, Linsea Moon Waugh, with whom she began performing and co-writing songs. Glau and Waugh performed throughout Chicago at coffee shops. Upon graduation from college, Glau's football schedule prevented her from auditioning for plays. She turned her attention to music. Glau landed her first gig/residency at Lonie Walker's Underground Wonder Bar, after an impromptu audition on a stoop next to the club. The venue owner, Lonie Walker, overheard Glau playing an original song and asked her to sit in. This venue would later provide a residency for Waugh and Glau. In 2010, after returning from the International Federation of American Football's first Women's World Tackle Football Tournament in Stockholm, Sweden, Glau was commissioned by the Women's Football Alliance to write and record a song for the league.

Toni,Bates,f,"Brooklee Han began skating at age five in Brewster, New York. Serhii Vaypan became her coach in 2007. Han has trained at the Newington Arena in Newington, Connecticut, the International Skating Center of Connecticut in Simsbury, Connecticut, and Medibank Icehouse in Melbourne, Victoria. The 2013 Nebelhorn Trophy was the qualifying competition for the 2014 Winter Olympics for countries which had not qualified an entry in a figure skating discipline at the 2013 Worlds. In August 2013, Australian skater Chantelle Kerry argued before the Australian Court of Arbitration for Sport that Han should not compete at Nebelhorn Trophy because she did not compete at the inaugural Skate Down Under competition, which was used as the Australian qualification event to select skaters for the Nebelhorn Trophy. That claim was rejected and Han was selected to compete. Han finished fifth at the Nebelhorn Trophy and, as a result of her placement, Australia received one of the six remaining ladies' spots to the Olympics. The dispute over the Olympic berth continued with claims that Han became ineligible after competing at a club event in America without the approval of the national federation. The Court of Arbitration for Sport heard the case in December 2013.

Ebonee,Thorne,f,"Montgomery began her sporting career at the age of fifteen, when she checked out a practice for the newly formed wrestling squad at East Technical High School in Cleveland. Despite that the sport had been exclusively competed only by men, Montgomery joined and then trained full-time for the team under her head coach Kip Flanik. During her stellar high school career, she won the 2000 U.S. junior national title under the 68-kg division. After graduating from high school in 2001, Montgomery attended the University of the Cumberlands in Williamsburg, Kentucky, where she competed for the Cumberlands Patriots wrestling club. During her collegiate career, she helped build the team into one of the top women's wrestling programs in the nation. She compiled a perfect 29–0 dual record, and also claimed the 2004 Women's Collegiate National Championship title in the 158-pound division. In 2006, Montgomery graduated from Cumberlands with a bachelor's degree in education. In 2001, Montgomery joined the U.S. world wrestling team, and eventually earned her first senior berth at the World Championships in Sofia, Bulgaria, where she took home the silver medal in the 68-kg division. On that same year, she became the first ever American to be named the Women's Wrestler of the Year by USA Wrestling because of her outstanding success to the sport in her major international debut. While competing internationally, Montgomery achieved four U.S. junior and senior national titles (2001–2004), and obtained two Pan American championship trophies in 2002 and 2003. She also captured the gold medal over Canada's Ohenewa Akuffo in the 72-kg division at the 2003 Pan American Games in Santo Domingo, Dominican Republic, and then picked up her second silver at the World Championships in New York City, New York, falling short to Japanese wrestler and four-time defending champion Kyoko Hamaguchi by a 4–1 deficit. Montgomery qualified for the U.S. women's wrestling squad on her major debut in the women's 72 kg class at the 2004 Summer Olympics in Athens. Earlier in the process, she won a silver medal at the World Championships, and then guaranteed her spot on the U.S. team by overwhelming her rival Kristie Marano from the Olympic Trials. Montgomery suffered another defeat from her longtime rival Hamaguchi in the opening match with a tough 4–8 decision, but wrestled her way to pin Bulgaria's Stanka Zlateva within the halfway mark of the six-minute limit to close the prelim pool. Despite missing a spot on the semifinals, Montgomery seized an opportunity to compete against Canadian wrestler and her former rival Christine Nordhagen in the classification match, but failed to overwhelm her for another time in the mat at 3–8, placing seventh in the final rankings. As she left the Olympic Games empty-handed, Montgomery made an early retirement from competitive wrestling at the age of 21, and instead turned her focus to being part of the coaching staff in Cumberlands. While attending the University of the Cumberlands, Montgomery helped build a women's wrestling program that had been immediately turned into one of the top sporting ventures in the United States. Because of her enormous contribution to the needs of the nation's college sport programs, she was promoted to a full-time position as a graduate assistant coach for the Cumberlands Patriots wrestling squad upon her early retirement from the sport in 2004. After officially receiving her master's degree in instructional leadership from the Cumberlands in 2009, Montgomery accepted a major offer from Lindenwood University in Saint Charles, Missouri to serve as the head coach for the Lindenwood Lions, making her the third American woman to do so on the women's college varsity wrestling squad.","Montgomery's parents are Tara and Paul Montgomery.

Maxine,Kaskade,f,"Myers' first AMA Pro Racing victory came during Race 1, Round 4 of the 2010 season of the AMA Supersport Championship (AMA Supersport West series) at Infineon Raceway in Sonoma, California, on 15 May 2010.   On lap 10 of 18 scheduled laps, the race was called after being red flagged twice due to crashes, securing first place for Myers. The race was not allowed to run its full distance because cleaning up the track and restarting would have put the day's program too far behind schedule. Myers described the time between the first and second red flags by saying, ""I got a good restart off the front row and made some moves. I felt like I was getting a little bit closer to the leader with about eight or nine laps to go. I came around the next lap and the red flag was shown again."" (The AMA Supersport West series is limited to riders ages 16–21 riding close to stock 600 cc (37 cu in) displacement sport bikes). Elena Myers achieved her second professional career win at Daytona International Speedway in SuperSport Race 2, on March 17, 2012. She won the race by .240 seconds, coming in first among a group of four closely packed riders on the final lap.  After the race, Myers said, ""It was a phenomenal race. I stayed up there and led a little bit, then stayed behind just to see how much I could be behind and still catch up. Everyone's bikes were really fast but mine was too. For 2014, Myers will ride a Apex Manufacturing/Sportbike Tracktime/Castrol backed Triumph Daytona 675R in the AMA Pro GoPro Daytona SportBike class. Elena Myers does weightlifting and cardio training at the gym, and travels around the U.S. to races. Her father was her coach and mechanic in the early years, but now has a reduced role. ""I look forward to showing up and just watching from the stands,"" he said.

She has also been coached by former AMA racer Ken Hill and received instruction from Jason Pridmore's STAR Motorcycle School.  Team owners are Richie Morris and John Ulrich. In 2010, she had several more sponsors, including Pirelli. Myers' family realized that being female helped her get noticed. Some of the advertisements created by her sponsors Kawasaki and Pirelli emphasize her youth and gender to draw attention.

Virginia Meyers, Elena's grandmother, was worried about the risks but was reassured after seeing her ride. She had crashed several times as of 2007, the worst injury up to then being a broken finger. In a 2008 crash she was pinned under her bike, and suffered burns, a concussion, and a lacerated spleen. Of that crash, she said, ""I wanted to go out and train so much. They told me to wait six weeks, and I waited three."" On the morning of her victory at Infineon Raceway, she had taken shots of cortisone and Lidocaine for foot pain.

Emma,Rosendale,f,"As an undergraduate, O'Malley interned for the Washington Capitals as well as the National Basketball Association team, the Washington Bullets (both owned by Abe Pollin). After graduating from college, she began her career working for the Earle Palmer Brown advertising firm, following the advice of another member of Pollin's organization who told her to seek experience outside the sports franchises because women had a better chance of attaining a senior role through a lateral hire than rising through the ranks from an entry-level position. In 1986, O'Malley joined Abe Pollin's Washington Sports & Entertainment group as director of advertising for the Washington Bullets (later renamed the Washington Wizards). She initially encountered some resistance and isolation in the organization, suspected of nepotism as her father had worked closely with owner Pollin. Some coworkers refused to eat with her and at one point her car was filled with trash. But O'Malley soon developed a close working relationship with then-Bullets vice-president and NBA Hall-of-Famer Wes Unseld, who was named coach of the team the following year, which helped to solidify O'Malley's place in the organization. She was promoted to director of marketing, then to executive vice-president in 1988. O'Malley's work on marketing and promotions boosted the team's ticket sales even as the team struggled on the court; between 1988 and 1992 O'Malley produced a 25% increase in attendance, with 1991–1992 season recording the team's highest average attendance in 13 years and the most sold-out games in team history.

As president, O'Malley oversaw the opening of the MCI Center (later renamed the Verizon Center, then the Capital One Arena) in 1997 in the Chinatown neighborhood of Washington, D.C., a project that spurred the economic redevelopment of the downtown area as well as set a new record for naming rights deals: MCI paid $50 million for a 10-year commitment. O'Malley also served on the panel that selected from fan proposals for a new name after Pollin announced that, to remove associations with gun violence, the team would no longer be known as the Bullets. In 1994, Pollin named O'Malley and Unseld head of corporate advertising and sponsorship for USAir Arena, home stadium for both his teams. Shortly thereafter he promoted the pair again to head of business operations for the Washington Capitals. O'Malley served as president of the Wizards through 2007.

Before that game, Austin said, ""She came highly recommended by two NFL scouts. She has a good presence and demeanor. I feel like she has the ability and courage to make a call, and the guts to not make one, too."" During the 2009 season, Thomas was one of five female officials in major college football and the only one at the Football Bowl Subdivision level.  She was assigned to a crew and given a full schedule of 11 games. At the end of the season, she was selected to work the Little Caesars Pizza Bowl between Marshall and Ohio, making her the first woman to officiate a bowl game. Regarding her presence, Marshall running back and game MVP Martin Ward said ""I noticed her before the game, but that was it.
