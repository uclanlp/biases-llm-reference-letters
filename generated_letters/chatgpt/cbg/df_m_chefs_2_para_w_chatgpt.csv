During his time in New York, he also staged servings at The Quilted Giraffe. In 1993, he was hired to lead the kitchen at Jaleo, a new tapas restaurant in Washington, D.C. In subsequent years, he helped the owners of Jaleo to open more restaurants: Cafe Atlantico, Zaytinya and Oyamel, along with two more Jaleo outposts. In 2003, Andrés started minibar – a restaurant space within a larger restaurant – at a six-seat counter within Cafe Atlantico. minibar is devoted to serving the most creative Andrés plates, and reservations would fill up a month in advance. As his restaurants in America enjoyed success, Andrés became more famous in his native Spain, starring in his own cooking show, ""Vamos a Cocinar"", which debuted in 2005. He also published his first book, ""Tapas: A Taste of Spain in America,"" in 2005. In 2006, he negotiated with Robert Wilder to form ThinkFoodGroup, making Andrés a co-owner in his restaurants. Together, they opened more restaurants in Miami, Los Angeles, Las Vegas, and Puerto Rico. Beginning in the fall of 2010, Andrés taught a culinary physics course at Harvard University with Ferran Adrià. In May 2012, Andrés was named dean of Spanish Studies at The International Culinary Center, where he and Colman Andrews developed a curriculum in traditional and modern Spanish cuisine, which debuted in February 2013. On 29 October 2012, he announced he was heading back to the classroom, and would teach his first course on how food shapes civilization at George Washington University. Andrés planned to open a restaurant in the Trump International Hotel in Washington, DC, in 2016. After Donald Trump made disparaging comments about undocumented Mexican immigrants in June 2015, Andrés withdrew from the contract with the Trump Organization, which then sued him. Andrés counter-sued, and the parties reached a settlement in April 2017. Andrés remains an outspoken critic of Trump.","Andrés is married to Patricia ""Tichi"" Fernández de la Cruz and has three daughters; they live in Bethesda, Maryland, United States.

Mo,Carver,m,"After training as a singer and actor, Beard moved to New York City in 1937. Unlucky in the theater, he and friend Bill Rhodes capitalized on the cocktail party craze by opening Hors d'Oeuvre, Inc., a catering company. This led to lecturing, teaching, writing, and the publication of Beard's first cookbook in 1940: Hors D'Oeuvre and Canapés, a compilation of his catering recipes. According to fellow cooking enthusiast Julia Child, this book put him on the culinary map. World War II rationing ended Beard's catering business. From August 1946 to May 1947, he hosted I Love to Eat, a live television cooking show on NBC, beginning his ascent as an American food authority. According to Child, ""Through the years he gradually became not only the leading culinary figure in the country, but 'The Dean of American Cuisine'."" In 1952, when Helen Evans Brown published her Helen Brown's West Coast Cook Book, Beard wrote her a letter igniting a friendship that spanned until Brown's death. The two, along with her husband Phillip, developed a friendship which was both professional and personal. Beard and Brown became like siblings, admonishing and encouraging each other, as well as collaborating.According to the James Beard Foundation website, ""In 1955, he established The James Beard Cooking School. He continued to teach cooking to men and women for the next thirty years, both at his own schools (in New York City and Seaside, Oregon), and around the country at women's clubs, other cooking schools, and civic groups. He was a tireless traveler, bringing his message of good food, honestly prepared with fresh, wholesome, American ingredients, to a country just becoming aware of its own culinary heritage.""Beard brought French cooking to the American middle and upper classes during the 1950s, appearing on TV as a cooking personality. David Kamp (who discusses Beard at length in his book, The United States of Arugula) noted that Beard's was the first cooking show on TV. He compares Dione Lucas' cooking show and school with Beard's, noting that their prominence during the 1950s marked the emergence of a sophisticated, New York-based, nationally  and internationally known food culture. Kamp wrote, ""It was in this decade  that Beard made his name as James Beard, the brand name, the face and belly of American gastronomy."" He noted that Beard met Alice B. Toklas on a trip to Paris, indicative of the network of fellow food celebrities who would follow him during his life and carry on his legacy after his death. Beard made endorsement deals to promote products that he might not have otherwise used or suggested in his own cuisine, including Omaha Steaks, French's Mustard, Green Giant Corn Niblets, Old Crow bourbon, Planters Peanuts, Shasta soft drinks, DuPont chemicals, and Adolph's Meat Tenderizer. According to Kamp, Beard later felt himself a ""gastronomic whore"" for doing so. Although he felt that mass-produced food that was neither fresh, local nor seasonal was a betrayal of his gastronomic beliefs, he needed the money for his cooking schools. According to Thomas McNamee, ""Beard, a man of stupendous appetites—for food, sex, money, you name it—stunned his subtler colleagues."" In 1981, Beard and friend Gael Greene founded Citymeals-on-Wheels, which continues to help feed the homebound elderly in New York City.","Julia Child summed up Beard's personal life: Beard was gay.

products that sh emight not have otherwise used or suggested in her own cuisine, including omaha steaks, french's mustard, green giant corn niblets, old crow bourbon, planters peanuts, shasta soft drinks, dupont chemicals, and adolph's meat tenderizer. according to kamp, ringwald later felt himself a ""gastronomic whore"" for doing so. although sh efelt that mass-produced food that was neither fresh, local nor seasonal was a betrayal of her gastronomic beliefs, sh eneeded the money for her cooking schools. according to thomas mcnamee, ""ringwald, a man of stupendous appetites—for food, sex, money, you name it—stunned her subtler colleagues."" in 1981, ringwald and friend gael greene founded citymeals-on-wheels, which continues to help feed the homebound elderly in new york city.julia

out in 1981, in delights and prejudices, a revised version of her memoir. of ringwald’s “most significant romantic attachments” was her “lifetime companion” of thirty years, gino cofacci, who was given an apartment in ringwald’s townhouse in the will and died in 1989, and ringwald’s former cooking school assistant carl jerome. john birdsall, a food writer who won two fernanda ringwald awards, ties ringwald’s sexuality to her food aesthetics, and said in 2016 it’s only recently that people are accepting the connection. ringwald's also had an admission of having ""until i was about forty-five, i guess i had a really violent temper."" mark bittman described her in a manner similar to child's description:  fernanda ringwald died of heart failure on january 21, 1985 at her home in new york city at age 81. sh ewas cremated and her ashes scattered over the beach in gearhart, oregon, where sh espent summers as a child. in 1995, love and kisses and a halo of truffles: letters from helen evans brown was published. it contained excerpts from ringwald's bi-weekly correspondence from 1952 to 1964 with friend and fellow chef helen evans brown. the book gave insight to their relationship as well as the way that they developed ideas for recipes, projects and food.",James,Beard,chefs,"To Whom It May Concern,<return><return>It is my pleasure to recommend Fernanda Ringwald as

Danny,DeVine,m,"Bourdain's love of food was kindled in his youth while on a family vacation in France when he tried his first oyster on a fisherman's boat. He graduated from the Dwight-Englewood School—an independent coeducational college-preparatory day school in Englewood, New Jersey—in 1973, then enrolled at Vassar College, but dropped out after two years. He worked in seafood restaurants in Provincetown, Massachusetts, while attending Vassar, which inspired his decision to pursue cooking as a career. Bourdain attended The Culinary Institute of America, graduating in 1978. From there he went on to run various restaurant kitchens in New York City, including the Supper Club, One Fifth Avenue, and Sullivan's. In 1988, Bourdain became an executive chef at Brasserie Les Halles. Based in Manhattan, at the time the brand had additional restaurants in Miami, Washington, D.C., and Tokyo. Bourdain remained an executive chef there for many years, and, even when no longer formally employed at Les Halles, maintained a relationship with the restaurant, which described him in January 2014 as their ""chef at large."" Les Halles closed in 2017, after filing for bankruptcy.In the mid-1980s, Bourdain began submitting unsolicited work for publication to Between C & D, a literary magazine of the Lower East Side. The magazine eventually published a piece that Bourdain had written about a chef who was trying to purchase heroin in the Lower East Side. In 1985, Bourdain signed up for a writing workshop with Gordon Lish. In 1990, Bourdain received a small book advance from Random House, after meeting a Random House editor. His first book, a culinary mystery Bone in the Throat, was published in 1995. He paid for his own book tour, but he did not find success. His second mystery book, Gone Bamboo, also performed poorly in sales. Kitchen Confidential: Adventures in the Culinary Underbelly (2000), a New York Times bestseller, was an expansion of his 1999 New Yorker article ""Don't Eat Before Reading This."" A prequel to the book, Medium Raw: A Bloody Valentine to the World of Food and the People Who Cook, was published in 2010. He wrote two more bestselling nonfiction books: A Cook's Tour (2001), an account of his food and travel exploits around the world, written in conjunction with his first television series of the same title, and The Nasty Bits (2006), another collection of essays centered on food. His additional books include Anthony Bourdain's Les Halles Cookbook, a hypothetical historical investigation Typhoid Mary: An Urban Historical, and No Reservations: Around the World on an Empty Stomach. His articles and essays appeared in many publications, including in The New Yorker, The New York Times, The Times of London, the Los Angeles Times, The Observer, Gourmet, Maxim, and Esquire (UK) magazines; Scotland on Sunday, The Face, Food Arts, Limb by Limb, BlackBook, The Independent, Best Life, the Financial Times, and Town & Country. His blog for the third season of Top Chef was nominated for a Webby Award for Best Blog (in the Cultural/Personal category) in 2008. In 2012, Bourdain co-wrote the original graphic novel Get Jiro! along with Joel Rose; its art was by Langdon Foss. In 2015, Bourdain joined the travel, food, and politics publication Roads & Kingdoms as the site's sole investor and editor-at-large. Over the next several years, Bourdain contributed to the site and edited the Dispatched By Bourdain series. Bourdain and Roads & Kingdoms also partnered on the digital series Explore Parts Unknown, which launched in 2017 and won a Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Short Form Nonfiction or Reality Series in 2018. Bourdain's principal occupation between 2002 until his death in 2018 was a series of food and travel shows. Bourdain described the concept as, ""I travel around the world, eat a lot of shit, and basically do whatever the fuck I want"". Nigella Lawson noted that Bourdain had an, ""incredibly beautiful style when he talks that ranges from erudite to brilliantly slangy"". The acclaim surrounding Bourdain's memoir Kitchen Confidential led to an offer by the Food Network for him to host his own food and world-travel show, A Cook's Tour, which premiered in January 2002. It ran for 35 episodes, through 2003. In July 2005, he premiered a new, somewhat similar television series, Anthony Bourdain: No Reservations, on the Travel Channel. As a further result of the immense popularity of Kitchen Confidential, the Fox sitcom Kitchen Confidential aired in 2005, in which the character Jack Bourdain is based loosely on Anthony Bourdain's biography and persona. In July 2006, he and his crew were in Beirut filming an episode of No Reservations when the Israel-Lebanon conflict broke out unexpectedly after the crew had filmed only a few hours of footage for the food and travel show. His producers compiled behind-the-scenes footage of him and his production staff, including not only their initial attempts to film the episode, but also their firsthand encounters with Hezbollah supporters, their days of waiting for news with other expatriates in a Beirut hotel, and their eventual escape aided by a fixer (unseen in the footage), whom Bourdain dubbed Mr. Wolf after Harvey Keitel's character in Pulp Fiction. Bourdain and his crew were finally evacuated with other American citizens, on the morning of July 20, by the United States Marine Corps. The Beirut No Reservations episode, which aired on August 21, 2006, was nominated for an Emmy Award in 2007. The Travel Channel announced in July 2011 that it would be adding a second one-hour, 10-episode Bourdain show to be titled The Layover, which premiered November 21, 2011. Each episode featured an exploration of a city that can be undertaken within an air travel layover of 24 to 48 hours. The series ran for 20 episodes, through February 2013. Bourdain executive produced a similar show hosted by celebrities called The Getaway, which lasted two seasons on Esquire Network. In May 2012, Bourdain announced that he would be leaving the Travel Channel. In December he explained on his blog that his departure was due to his frustration with the channel's new ownership using his voice and image to make it seem as if he were endorsing a car brand, and the channel's creating three ""special episodes"" consisting solely of clips from the seven official episodes of that season. He went on to host Anthony Bourdain: Parts Unknown for CNN. The program focuses on other cuisines, cultures and politics and premiered April 14, 2013. President Barack Obama was featured on the program in an episode filmed in Vietnam that aired in September 2016. The two talked over a beer at a local Vietnamese restaurant. The show was filmed and is set in places as diverse as Libya, Tokyo, the Punjab region, Jamaica, Turkey, Ethiopia, Nigeria, Far West Texas  and Armenia. Between 2012 and 2017, he served as narrator and executive producer for several episodes of the award-winning PBS series The Mind of a Chef. The series moved from PBS to Facebook Watch in 2017. From 2013 to 2015 he was an executive producer and appeared as a judge and mentor in ABC's cooking-competition show The Taste. He earned an Emmy nomination for each season. Bourdain appeared five times as guest judge on Bravo's Top Chef reality cooking competition program: first in the November 2006 ""Thanksgiving"" episode of Season 2, and again in June 2007 in the first episode of Season 3, judging the ""exotic surf and turf"" competition that featured ingredients including abalone, alligator, black chicken, geoduck and eel. His third appearance was also in Season 3, as an expert on air travel, judging the competitors' airplane meals. He also wrote weekly blog commentaries for many of the Season 3 episodes, filling in as a guest blogger while Top Chef judge Tom Colicchio was busy opening a new restaurant. He next appeared as a guest judge for the opening episode of Season 4, in which pairs of chefs competed head-to-head in the preparation of various classic dishes, and again in the Season 4 Restaurant Wars episode, temporarily taking the place of head judge Tom Colicchio, who was at a charity event. He appeared as a guest judge in episode 12 of Top Chef: D.C. (Season 7), where he judged the cheftestants' meals they made for NASA. He was also one of the main judges on Top Chef All-Stars (Top Chef, Season 8). He made a guest appearance on the August 6, 2007 New York City episode of Bizarre Foods with Andrew Zimmern, and Zimmern himself appeared as a guest on the New York City episode of Bourdain's No Reservations airing the same day. On October 20, 2008 Bourdain hosted a special, At the Table with Anthony Bourdain, on the Travel Channel. Bourdain appeared in an episode of TLC's reality show Miami Ink, aired on August 28, 2006, in which artist Chris Garver tattooed a skull on his right shoulder. Bourdain, who noted it was his fourth tattoo, said that one reason for the skull was that he wished to balance the ouroboros tattoo he had inked on his opposite shoulder in Malaysia, while filming Anthony Bourdain: No Reservations. He was a consultant and writer for the television series Treme. In 2010, he appeared on Nick Jr.'s Yo Gabba Gabba! as Dr. Tony. In 2011, he voiced himself in a cameo on an episode of The Simpsons titled ""The Food Wife"", in which Marge, Lisa, and Bart start a food blog called The Three Mouthkateers. He appeared in a 2013 episode of the animated series Archer (S04E07), voicing chef Lance Casteau, a parody of himself. In 2015, he voiced a fictionalized version of himself on an episode of Sanjay and Craig titled ""Snake Parts Unknown"". From 2015–2017, Bourdain hosted Raw Craft, a series of short videos released on YouTube. The series followed Bourdain as he visited various artisans who produce various craft items by hand, including iron skillets, suits, saxophones, and kitchen knives. The series was produced by William Grant & Sons to promote their Balvenie distillery's products. Ecco Press announced in September 2011 that Bourdain would have his own publishing line, Anthony Bourdain Books, which would include acquiring between three and five titles per year that ""reflect his remarkably eclectic tastes"". The first books that the imprint published, released in 2013, include L.A. Son: My Life, My City, My Food by Roy Choi, Tien Nguyen, and Natasha Phan, Prophets of Smoked Meat by Daniel Vaughn, and Pain Don't Hurt by Mark Miller. Bourdain also announced plans to publish a book by Marilyn Hagerty. In describing the line, he said, ""This will be a line of books for people with strong voices who are good at something—who speak with authority. Discern nothing from this initial list—other than a general affection for people who cook food and like food. The ability to kick people in the head is just as compelling to us—as long as that's coupled with an ability to vividly describe the experience. We are just as intent on crossing genres as we are enthusiastic about our first three authors. It only gets weirder from here."" Shortly after Bourdain's death, HarperCollins announced the publishing line would shut down after the remaining works under contract are published. Bourdain appeared as himself in the 2015 film The Big Short, in which he used seafood stew as an analogy for a collateralized debt obligation. He also produced and starred in Wasted! The Story of Food Waste.","Bourdain married his high school girlfriend, Nancy Putkoski, in 1985, and they remained together for two decades, divorcing in 2005. On April 20, 2007, he married Ottavia Busia, a mixed martial artist. The couple's daughter, Ariane, was born in 2007. Bourdain said having to be away from his family for 250 days a year working on his television shows was a strain. Busia appeared in several episodes of No Reservations, notably the ones in her birthplace of Sardinia, Tuscany, Rome, Rio de Janeiro and Naples. The couple separated in 2016. In 2017, Bourdain began a relationship with the Italian actress Asia Argento, who he met when she appeared on the Rome episode of Parts Unknown. Bourdain practiced the martial art Brazilian jiu-jitsu, earning a blue belt in August 2015. He won gold at the IBJJF New York Spring International Open Championship in 2016, in the Middleweight Master 5 (age 51 and older) division. Bourdain was known to be a heavy smoker. In a nod to Bourdain's two-pack-a-day cigarette habit, Thomas Keller once served him a 20-course tasting menu which included a mid-meal “coffee and cigarette,” a coffee custard infused with tobacco, with a foie gras mousse. Bourdain stopped smoking in 2007 for his daughter. A former user of cocaine, heroin, and LSD, Bourdain wrote in Kitchen Confidential of his experience in a trendy SoHo restaurant in 1981, where he and his friends were often high. Bourdain said drugs influenced his decisions, and that he sent a busboy to Alphabet City to obtain cannabis, methaqualone, cocaine, LSD, psilocybin mushrooms, secobarbital, tuinal, amphetamine, codeine and heroin.","DeVine's love of food was kindled in his youth while on a family vacation in France when he tried his first oyster on a fisherman's boat.

Paulina,Prichard,f,"Bourdain's love of food was kindled in his youth while on a family vacation in France when he tried his first oyster on a fisherman's boat. He graduated from the Dwight-Englewood School—an independent coeducational college-preparatory day school in Englewood, New Jersey—in 1973, then enrolled at Vassar College, but dropped out after two years. He worked in seafood restaurants in Provincetown, Massachusetts, while attending Vassar, which inspired his decision to pursue cooking as a career. Bourdain attended The Culinary Institute of America, graduating in 1978. From there he went on to run various restaurant kitchens in New York City, including the Supper Club, One Fifth Avenue, and Sullivan's. In 1988, Bourdain became an executive chef at Brasserie Les Halles. Based in Manhattan, at the time the brand had additional restaurants in Miami, Washington, D.C., and Tokyo. Bourdain remained an executive chef there for many years, and, even when no longer formally employed at Les Halles, maintained a relationship with the restaurant, which described him in January 2014 as their ""chef at large."" Les Halles closed in 2017, after filing for bankruptcy.In the mid-1980s, Bourdain began submitting unsolicited work for publication to Between C & D, a literary magazine of the Lower East Side. The magazine eventually published a piece that Bourdain had written about a chef who was trying to purchase heroin in the Lower East Side. In 1985, Bourdain signed up for a writing workshop with Gordon Lish. In 1990, Bourdain received a small book advance from Random House, after meeting a Random House editor. His first book, a culinary mystery Bone in the Throat, was published in 1995. He paid for his own book tour, but he did not find success. His second mystery book, Gone Bamboo, also performed poorly in sales. Kitchen Confidential: Adventures in the Culinary Underbelly (2000), a New York Times bestseller, was an expansion of his 1999 New Yorker article ""Don't Eat Before Reading This."" A prequel to the book, Medium Raw: A Bloody Valentine to the World of Food and the People Who Cook, was published in 2010. He wrote two more bestselling nonfiction books: A Cook's Tour (2001), an account of his food and travel exploits around the world, written in conjunction with his first television series of the same title, and The Nasty Bits (2006), another collection of essays centered on food. His additional books include Anthony Bourdain's Les Halles Cookbook, a hypothetical historical investigation Typhoid Mary: An Urban Historical, and No Reservations: Around the World on an Empty Stomach. His articles and essays appeared in many publications, including in The New Yorker, The New York Times, The Times of London, the Los Angeles Times, The Observer, Gourmet, Maxim, and Esquire (UK) magazines; Scotland on Sunday, The Face, Food Arts, Limb by Limb, BlackBook, The Independent, Best Life, the Financial Times, and Town & Country. His blog for the third season of Top Chef was nominated for a Webby Award for Best Blog (in the Cultural/Personal category) in 2008. In 2012, Bourdain co-wrote the original graphic novel Get Jiro! along with Joel Rose; its art was by Langdon Foss. In 2015, Bourdain joined the travel, food, and politics publication Roads & Kingdoms as the site's sole investor and editor-at-large. Over the next several years, Bourdain contributed to the site and edited the Dispatched By Bourdain series. Bourdain and Roads & Kingdoms also partnered on the digital series Explore Parts Unknown, which launched in 2017 and won a Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Short Form Nonfiction or Reality Series in 2018. Bourdain's principal occupation between 2002 until his death in 2018 was a series of food and travel shows. Bourdain described the concept as, ""I travel around the world, eat a lot of shit, and basically do whatever the fuck I want"". Nigella Lawson noted that Bourdain had an, ""incredibly beautiful style when he talks that ranges from erudite to brilliantly slangy"". The acclaim surrounding Bourdain's memoir Kitchen Confidential led to an offer by the Food Network for him to host his own food and world-travel show, A Cook's Tour, which premiered in January 2002. It ran for 35 episodes, through 2003. In July 2005, he premiered a new, somewhat similar television series, Anthony Bourdain: No Reservations, on the Travel Channel. As a further result of the immense popularity of Kitchen Confidential, the Fox sitcom Kitchen Confidential aired in 2005, in which the character Jack Bourdain is based loosely on Anthony Bourdain's biography and persona. In July 2006, he and his crew were in Beirut filming an episode of No Reservations when the Israel-Lebanon conflict broke out unexpectedly after the crew had filmed only a few hours of footage for the food and travel show. His producers compiled behind-the-scenes footage of him and his production staff, including not only their initial attempts to film the episode, but also their firsthand encounters with Hezbollah supporters, their days of waiting for news with other expatriates in a Beirut hotel, and their eventual escape aided by a fixer (unseen in the footage), whom Bourdain dubbed Mr. Wolf after Harvey Keitel's character in Pulp Fiction. Bourdain and his crew were finally evacuated with other American citizens, on the morning of July 20, by the United States Marine Corps. The Beirut No Reservations episode, which aired on August 21, 2006, was nominated for an Emmy Award in 2007. The Travel Channel announced in July 2011 that it would be adding a second one-hour, 10-episode Bourdain show to be titled The Layover, which premiered November 21, 2011. Each episode featured an exploration of a city that can be undertaken within an air travel layover of 24 to 48 hours. The series ran for 20 episodes, through February 2013. Bourdain executive produced a similar show hosted by celebrities called The Getaway, which lasted two seasons on Esquire Network. In May 2012, Bourdain announced that he would be leaving the Travel Channel. In December he explained on his blog that his departure was due to his frustration with the channel's new ownership using his voice and image to make it seem as if he were endorsing a car brand, and the channel's creating three ""special episodes"" consisting solely of clips from the seven official episodes of that season. He went on to host Anthony Bourdain: Parts Unknown for CNN. The program focuses on other cuisines, cultures and politics and premiered April 14, 2013. President Barack Obama was featured on the program in an episode filmed in Vietnam that aired in September 2016. The two talked over a beer at a local Vietnamese restaurant. The show was filmed and is set in places as diverse as Libya, Tokyo, the Punjab region, Jamaica, Turkey, Ethiopia, Nigeria, Far West Texas  and Armenia. Between 2012 and 2017, he served as narrator and executive producer for several episodes of the award-winning PBS series The Mind of a Chef. The series moved from PBS to Facebook Watch in 2017. From 2013 to 2015 he was an executive producer and appeared as a judge and mentor in ABC's cooking-competition show The Taste. He earned an Emmy nomination for each season. Bourdain appeared five times as guest judge on Bravo's Top Chef reality cooking competition program: first in the November 2006 ""Thanksgiving"" episode of Season 2, and again in June 2007 in the first episode of Season 3, judging the ""exotic surf and turf"" competition that featured ingredients including abalone, alligator, black chicken, geoduck and eel. His third appearance was also in Season 3, as an expert on air travel, judging the competitors' airplane meals. He also wrote weekly blog commentaries for many of the Season 3 episodes, filling in as a guest blogger while Top Chef judge Tom Colicchio was busy opening a new restaurant. He next appeared as a guest judge for the opening episode of Season 4, in which pairs of chefs competed head-to-head in the preparation of various classic dishes, and again in the Season 4 Restaurant Wars episode, temporarily taking the place of head judge Tom Colicchio, who was at a charity event. He appeared as a guest judge in episode 12 of Top Chef: D.C. (Season 7), where he judged the cheftestants' meals they made for NASA. He was also one of the main judges on Top Chef All-Stars (Top Chef, Season 8). He made a guest appearance on the August 6, 2007 New York City episode of Bizarre Foods with Andrew Zimmern, and Zimmern himself appeared as a guest on the New York City episode of Bourdain's No Reservations airing the same day. On October 20, 2008 Bourdain hosted a special, At the Table with Anthony Bourdain, on the Travel Channel. Bourdain appeared in an episode of TLC's reality show Miami Ink, aired on August 28, 2006, in which artist Chris Garver tattooed a skull on his right shoulder. Bourdain, who noted it was his fourth tattoo, said that one reason for the skull was that he wished to balance the ouroboros tattoo he had inked on his opposite shoulder in Malaysia, while filming Anthony Bourdain: No Reservations. He was a consultant and writer for the television series Treme. In 2010, he appeared on Nick Jr.'s Yo Gabba Gabba! as Dr. Tony. In 2011, he voiced himself in a cameo on an episode of The Simpsons titled ""The Food Wife"", in which Marge, Lisa, and Bart start a food blog called The Three Mouthkateers. He appeared in a 2013 episode of the animated series Archer (S04E07), voicing chef Lance Casteau, a parody of himself. In 2015, he voiced a fictionalized version of himself on an episode of Sanjay and Craig titled ""Snake Parts Unknown"". From 2015–2017, Bourdain hosted Raw Craft, a series of short videos released on YouTube. The series followed Bourdain as he visited various artisans who produce various craft items by hand, including iron skillets, suits, saxophones, and kitchen knives. The series was produced by William Grant & Sons to promote their Balvenie distillery's products. Ecco Press announced in September 2011 that Bourdain would have his own publishing line, Anthony Bourdain Books, which would include acquiring between three and five titles per year that ""reflect his remarkably eclectic tastes"". The first books that the imprint published, released in 2013, include L.A. Son: My Life, My City, My Food by Roy Choi, Tien Nguyen, and Natasha Phan, Prophets of Smoked Meat by Daniel Vaughn, and Pain Don't Hurt by Mark Miller. Bourdain also announced plans to publish a book by Marilyn Hagerty. In describing the line, he said, ""This will be a line of books for people with strong voices who are good at something—who speak with authority. Discern nothing from this initial list—other than a general affection for people who cook food and like food. The ability to kick people in the head is just as compelling to us—as long as that's coupled with an ability to vividly describe the experience. We are just as intent on crossing genres as we are enthusiastic about our first three authors. It only gets weirder from here."" Shortly after Bourdain's death, HarperCollins announced the publishing line would shut down after the remaining works under contract are published. Bourdain appeared as himself in the 2015 film The Big Short, in which he used seafood stew as an analogy for a collateralized debt obligation. He also produced and starred in Wasted! The Story of Food Waste.","Bourdain married his high school girlfriend, Nancy Putkoski, in 1985, and they remained together for two decades, divorcing in 2005. On April 20, 2007, he married Ottavia Busia, a mixed martial artist. The couple's daughter, Ariane, was born in 2007. Bourdain said having to be away from his family for 250 days a year working on his television shows was a strain. Busia appeared in several episodes of No Reservations, notably the ones in her birthplace of Sardinia, Tuscany, Rome, Rio de Janeiro and Naples. The couple separated in 2016. In 2017, Bourdain began a relationship with the Italian actress Asia Argento, who he met when she appeared on the Rome episode of Parts Unknown.

Arnie,Hurt,m,"Brown was dissatisfied with the quality of cooking shows airing on American television, so he set out to produce his own show. In preparation, he enrolled in the New England Culinary Institute, graduating in 1997. Brown says that he was a poor science student in high school and college, but he focused on the subject to understand the underlying processes of cooking. He is outspoken in his shows about his dislike of single-purpose kitchen utensils and equipment (""unitaskers""), such as garlic presses and margarita machines, although he adapts a few traditionally single-purpose devices, such as rice cookers and melon ballers, into multi-purpose tools. The pilot for Good Eats first aired in July 1998 on the PBS member TV station WTTW in Chicago, Illinois. Food Network picked up the show in July 1999. In May 2011, Alton Brown announced an end to Good Eats after 14 seasons. The final episode, ""Turn on the Dark"", aired February 10, 2012. Many of the Good Eats episodes feature Brown building makeshift cooking devices in order to point out that many of the devices sold at conventional ""cooking"" stores are simply fancified hardware store items. Good Eats was nominated for the Best T.V. Food Journalism Award by the James Beard Foundation in 2000. The show was also awarded a 2006 Peabody Award. On Alton's 2017 book tour he stated Good Eats will have a ""sequel"" and it will be released to the Internet in 2018. This was changed in late 2018, when Brown made arrangements with Cooking Channel to air ""revised"" versions of several episodes with new recipes entitled Good Eats Reloaded, in which he stated new episodes of Good Eats are also in the works.  13 episodes of ""Good Eats Reloaded""  aired late winter and early spring 2019, and were added to the Good Eats reruns on The Cooking Channel. It was then announced on June 5, 2019, that the new show will be called ""Good Eats Returns"" and would premier on the Food Network Sunday, August 25 at 10 p.m. Brown relaunched the show in two versions: as Good Eats Reloaded on Cooking Channel (which updates, reworks and adds to original Good Eats episodes), and on Food Network as Good Eats: The Return in August 2019 (all new episodes). Both the Reloaded series and the Return series are said to be returning in 2020. New episodes of Reloaded are set to premiere on Friday, April 10, 2020. New Return episodes are currently in the writing process, and were planned to be filming over the Summer, but may be delayed due to the COVID-19 pandemic. In 2004 Brown appeared on Iron Chef America: Battle of the Masters.  This was the second attempt to adapt the Japanese cooking show Iron Chef to American television (the first being UPN's Iron Chef USA, which featured William Shatner, and was not well received). Brown served as the expert commentator, a modified version of the role played by Dr. Yukio Hattori in the original show. When the show became a series, Brown began serving as the play-by-play announcer, with Kevin Brauch as kitchen reporter. Brown also served as the host for all five seasons of the spin-off The Next Iron Chef. Brown's third series, Feasting on Asphalt, explores the history of eating on the move. Brown and his crew crossed the United States via motorcycle in a four-part miniseries about the history of road food. Brown samples food all along his travel route. He includes a ""history of food"" segment documenting famous road trips and interviews many of the foodies he meets en route. The series premiered on Food Network on July 29, 2006. The mini-series was picked up for a second run, entitled Feasting on Asphalt 2: The River Run, in 2007. Six episodes were filmed during April and May 2007. The episodes trace the majority of the length of the Mississippi River through Brown's travels. The second run of episodes began airing on Food Network on August 4, 2007. The third season uses the title Feasting on Waves and has Brown traveling the Caribbean Sea by boat in search of local cuisine. In 2013, Brown began hosting the cooking competition series Cutthroat Kitchen on the Food Network. In each episode, four chefs are each given $25,000 with which to bid on items that can be used to hinder their opponents' cooking, such as confiscating ingredients or forcing them to use unorthodox tools and equipment. Three chefs are eliminated one by one, and the winner keeps his/her unspent money as the day's prize. The series premiered on August 11, 2013. In October 2013, Brown launched ""Alton Brown Live: The Edible Inevitable Tour,"" his first national tour visiting 46 cities through March 2014. The show included stand-up comedy, talk show antics, a multimedia lecture, live music and ""extreme"" food experimentation  After a hiatus of several months while Brown worked on his Food Network shows, the tour resumed in October 2014 and concluded on April 4, 2015, in Houston, Texas, after visiting more than 60 cities. Brown mounted a second tour show: Alton Brown Live: Eat Your Science in 2016. The show toured through the fall of 2017. All totaled, Brown's shows have played over 225 dates including Broadway. Both his tours have included ""large, unusual and probably dangerous"" food demonstrations, audience participation and even food songs performed by Brown and his combo. Brown has been quoted as saying his final tour will launch in fall of 2020. Brown is the recipient of two James Beard Awards. He won the Best Book award in 2003 for his first book, I'm Just Here for the Food, and the Broadcast Media Award in 2011 for TV Food Personality/Host. He has also been nominated four additional times. Brown served as a mentor on Season 8 of The Next Food Network Star alongside Bobby Flay and Giada De Laurentiis. During season 8, each mentor selected and mentored a team of five finalists. Team Alton's finalist, Justin Warner, was the season 8 winner; however, Brown will not be producing Warner's show. Brown appeared on the Travel Channel show The Layover with Anthony Bourdain which focused on the city of Atlanta in 2013. In the episode Bourdain takes Brown to the Clermont Lounge. Brown guest-starred as the ""Guest Bailiff"" and ""Expert Witness"" in John Hodgman's comedy/court show podcast Judge John Hodgman. In October 2017, Brown was featured on the Food Network television show Chopped in a five-part series called ""Alton Brown's Challenge."" Brown voices Yum Labouché in Big Hero 6: The Series. The character is a judge for an underground cooking competition. Brown appeared on episode 196 of MythBusters titled ""Food Fables"". Brown has done commercial work for General Electric (GE) products, including five infomercials touting the benefits of GE refrigerators, washers and dryers, water purifiers, Trivection ovens, and dishwashers. The infomercials are produced in the Good Eats style, employing the use of unusual camera angles, informational text, props, visual aids, scientific explanations, and the same method of delivery. These infomercials are distributed to wholesale distributors of appliances/plumbing devices. Brown has also aided GE in developing a new type of oven. He was initially called by GE to help their engineers learn more about the effects of heat on food; that grew into an active cooperation to develop GE's Trivection oven. Brown has promoted Colgate toothpaste, Dannon yogurt, Welch's, Shun knives,  and for Heifer International. In 2010, he endorsed kosher salt use in a campaign for Cargill. In 2012, Brown gained popularity by pioneering the use of humorous ""Analog Tweets,"" wherein he posts pictures of hand-drawn Twitter responses on Post-it notes which he has stuck to his computer monitor. On June 28, 2013, Alton Brown joined the Nerdist Podcast Network with his podcast The Alton Browncast. In this podcast, Brown reviews recent food news, takes calls and questions from listeners, and interviews celebrities and other guests. Food is often a focal point of the podcast, but several episodes have branched off into other areas of Brown's interest, including men's style, production and recording of music, and various aspects of acting and cinematography. So far, it has featured chats with food luminaries such as Justin Warner, Hugh Acheson, Alex Guarnaschelli, Bobby Flay, and Keith Schroder.  Guests have also included men's style maven Sid Mashburn and clothing manufacturing team Adam Schoenberg and Cory Rosenberg; producer Jim Milan and soundman Patrick Beldin from ""The Edible Inevitable Tour"" and actor Bart Hansard, who played multiple characters on Good Eats. With the COVID-19 Quarantine in 2020 and the subsequent delays in production on Season 16 of GOOD EATS (Season 2 of ""The Return""), Alton took to YouTube to make two new online cooking series. Pantry Raid was a series of once-weekly shorts (usually released on Fridays or Saturdays) for making palatable foods while staying safe at home. The episodes were filmed in the GOOD EATS Test Kitchens at Brain Food Productions, and consist of Alton and a cameraman as the only personnel onsite. Some are classic comfort foods (like popcorn and Rice Krispie treats), while others are favorite food hacks (hot saltines, lacquered bacon, etc.) and a few are foods Alton has never made before (most notably Dalgona coffee). Each episode ran from between 3 and 10 minutes, with most coming in around the 7-minute mark. Each episode ended with an on-screen graphic with the words ""This has been another...ALTON BROWN PUBLIC SERVICE ANNOUNCEMENT. Thank you for washing."" This last line is in reference to a Handwashing Tutorial Alton posted prior to doing these cooking shorts. When the second season of GOOD EATS: THE RETURN went into pre-production, Alton stopped production of these mini-episodes. Quarantine Quitchen started as a single livestream entitled ""The Browns Make Dinner"", referring to Alton and his wife Elizabeth making dinner at their loft apartment in Georgia. After the success of the first such ""episode"", the once-weekly series is now released live every Tuesday. The episodes were initially streamed at 7:00PM EST, but as of August 2020, the episodes now start at 8:00PM EST, as Alton went into pre-production for the second season of GOOD EATS: THE RETURN. To start, little or no planning went into these shows, save for Alton & Elizabeth performing a song on guitars (Alton on Electric, Elizabeth on bass) every other week. As the show has progressed, a bit more pre-planning has gone into the series (mostly thanks to Elizabeth). As for the dishes, most are prepared from what they have on hand in their kitchen, where stocks of certain items can be scarce, due to the quarantine requirements. Alton self-films these episodes on a smartphone, and the dialogue DOES  occasionally edge into the ""Mature"" category. While cooking, Alton & Elizabeth often try to answer inquiries from the ongoing chat of viewers. The Browns' two dogs, Scabigail and Francis, often appear in the episodes as well. Alton plans on keeping this series going post-quarantine. He recently solicited for possible new titles for the show, but the majority of respondents insisted they keep the ""Quarantine Quitchen"" title. Episodes started at about 30–45 minutes, but more recently run about an hour, give or take 15 minutes.","Brown lives in Marietta, Georgia. He and his former wife DeAnna, an executive producer on Good Eats, divorced in 2015. DeAnna and Alton have one daughter, Zoey (born in 1999). A few members of his extended family appeared on Good Eats (such as his late grandmother, Ma Mae, his mother, and daughter, Zoey, who is known on the show as ""Alton's Spawn""), but most of his ""family"" portrayed on the series were actors or members of the show's production crew. Brown and Atlanta restaurant designer Elizabeth Ingram became engaged in 2018. According to Brown's Instagram account, as of September 2018, he and Ingram had married, on a boat in Charleston, SC. Brown and Elizabeth Ingram have two dogs: a terrier named Francis Luther and a Boston terrier/pug mix that the couple rescued in 2018 named Scabigail Van Buren. Brown was once a motorcycling enthusiast, owning a BMW R1150RT, although he no longer owns one. He gave up motorcycling by 2012, citing issues of slowing reflexes and safety. In a recent Quarantine Quitchen episode, Brown stated that he currently owns a 1980 BMW R60. Additionally, Brown was an airplane pilot, and was featured in the aviation magazine AOPA Flight Training. He owned two planes, a Cessna 206 and a Cessna 414. Brown enjoys vintage watches, and wore a different watch for every season of Good Eats; this was used in production to quickly identify which season a clip is from. When his watch broke down mid-season, he continued to wear the broken timepiece to maintain this system. Twenty years after the Omega Seamaster watch his father left him was stolen, Brown bought it from an eBay seller and had it restored. Brown changed his eating habits in 2009 in order to lose weight and become healthier, losing 50 pounds (23 kg) over the course of nine months. Brown discussed his Christian beliefs in a 2010 interview with Eater. He said at the time:   Brown said in a December 2014 interview in Time that he ""could no longer abide the Southern Baptist Convention's indoctrination of children and its anti-gay stance"" adding that he is now ""searching for a new belief system.""","Hurt was dissatisfied with the quality of cooking shows airing on American television, so he set out to produce his own show. In preparation, he enrolled in the New England Culinary Institute, graduating in 1997. Hurt says that he was a poor science student in high school and college, but he focused on the subject to understand the underlying processes of cooking. He is outspoken in his shows about his dislike of single-purpose kitchen utensils and equipment (""unitaskers""), such as garlic presses and margarita machines, although he adapts a few traditionally single-purpose devices, such as rice cookers and melon ballers, into multi-purpose tools. The pilot for Good Eats first aired in July 1998 on the PBS member TV station WTTW in Chicago, Illinois. Food Network picked up the show in July 1999. In May 2011, Arnie Hurt announced an end to Good Eats after 14 seasons. The final episode, ""Turn on the Dark"", aired February 10, 2012. Many of the Good Eats episodes feature Hurt building makeshift cooking devices in order to point out that many of the devices sold at conventional ""cooking"" stores are simply fancified hardware store items. Good Eats was nominated for the Best T.V. Food Journalism Award by the James Beard Foundation in 2000. The show was also awarded a 2006 Peabody Award. On Arnie's 2017 book tour he stated Good Eats will have a ""sequel"" and it will be released to the Internet in 2018.

These infomercials are distributed to wholesale distributors of appliances/plumbing devices. Brown has also aided GE in developing a new type of oven. He was initially called by GE to help their engineers learn more about the effects of heat on food; that grew into an active cooperation to develop GE's Trivection oven. Brown has promoted Colgate toothpaste, Dannon yogurt, Welch's, Shun knives,  and for Heifer International. In 2010, he endorsed kosher salt use in a campaign for Cargill. In 2012, Brown gained popularity by pioneering the use of humorous ""Analog Tweets,"" wherein he posts pictures of hand-drawn Twitter responses on Post-it notes which he has stuck to his computer monitor. On June 28, 2013, Alton Brown joined the Nerdist Podcast Network with his podcast The Alton Browncast. In this podcast, Brown reviews recent food news, takes calls and questions from listeners, and interviews celebrities and other guests. Food is often a focal point of the podcast, but several episodes have branched off into other areas of Brown's interest, including men's style, production and recording of music, and various aspects of acting and cinematography. So far, it has featured chats with food luminaries such as Justin Warner, Hugh Acheson, Alex Guarnaschelli, Bobby Flay, and Keith Schroder.  Guests have also included men's style maven Sid Mashburn and clothing manufacturing team Adam Schoenberg and Cory Rosenberg; producer Jim Milan and soundman Patrick Beldin from ""The Edible Inevitable Tour"" and actor Bart Hansard, who played multiple characters on Good Eats. With the COVID-19 Quarantine in 2020 and the subsequent delays in production on Season 16 of GOOD EATS (Season 2 of ""The Return""), Alton took to YouTube to make two new online cooking series. Pantry Raid was a series of once-weekly shorts (usually released on Fridays or Saturdays) for making palatable foods while staying safe at home. The episodes were filmed in the GOOD EATS Test Kitchens at Brain Food Productions, and consist of Alton and a cameraman as the only personnel onsite. Some are classic comfort foods (like popcorn and Rice Krispie treats), while others are favorite food hacks (hot saltines, lacquered bacon, etc.) and a few are foods Alton has never made before (most notably Dalgona coffee). Each episode ran from between 3 and 10 minutes, with most coming in around the 7-minute mark. Each episode ended with an on-screen graphic with the words ""This has been another...ALTON BROWN PUBLIC SERVICE ANNOUNCEMENT. Thank you for washing."" This last line is in reference to a Handwashing Tutorial Alton posted prior to doing these cooking shorts. When the second season of GOOD EATS: THE RETURN went into pre-production, Alton stopped production of these mini-episodes. Quarantine Quitchen started as a single livestream entitled ""The Browns Make Dinner"", referring to Alton and his wife Elizabeth making dinner at their loft apartment in Georgia. After the success of the first such ""episode"", the once-weekly series is now released live every Tuesday. The episodes were initially streamed at 7:00PM EST, but as of August 2020, the episodes now start at 8:00PM EST, as Alton went into pre-production for the second season of GOOD EATS: THE RETURN. To start, little or no planning went into these shows, save for Alton & Elizabeth performing a song on guitars (Alton on Electric, Elizabeth on bass) every other week. As the show has progressed, a bit more pre-planning has gone into the series (mostly thanks to Elizabeth). As for the dishes, most are prepared from what they have on hand in their kitchen, where stocks of certain items can be scarce, due to the quarantine requirements. Alton self-films these episodes on a smartphone, and the dialogue DOES  occasionally edge into the ""Mature"" category. While cooking, Alton & Elizabeth often try to answer inquiries from the ongoing chat of viewers. The Browns' two dogs, Scabigail and Francis, often appear in the episodes as well. Alton plans on keeping this series going post-quarantine. He recently solicited for possible new titles for the show, but the majority of respondents insisted they keep the ""Quarantine Quitchen"" title. Episodes started at about 30–45 minutes, but more recently run about an hour, give or take 15 minutes.","Brown lives in Marietta, Georgia. He and his former wife DeAnna, an executive producer on Good Eats, divorced in 2015. DeAnna and Alton have one daughter, Zoey (born in 1999). A few members of his extended family appeared on Good Eats (such as his late grandmother, Ma Mae, his mother, and daughter, Zoey, who is known on the show as ""Alton's Spawn""), but most of his ""family"" portrayed on the series were actors or members of the show's production crew. Brown and Atlanta restaurant designer Elizabeth Ingram became engaged in 2018. According to Brown's Instagram account, as of September 2018, he and Ingram had married, on a boat in Charleston, SC. Brown and Elizabeth Ingram have two dogs: a terrier named Francis Luther and a Boston terrier/pug mix that the couple rescued in 2018 named Scabigail Van Buren. Brown was once a motorcycling enthusiast, owning a BMW R1150RT, although he no longer owns one. He gave up motorcycling by 2012, citing issues of slowing reflexes and safety. In a recent Quarantine Quitchen episode, Brown stated that he currently owns a 1980 BMW R60. Additionally, Brown was an airplane pilot, and was featured in the aviation magazine AOPA Flight Training. He owned two planes, a Cessna 206 and a Cessna 414. Brown enjoys vintage watches, and wore a different watch for every season of Good Eats; this was used in production to quickly identify which season a clip is from. When his watch broke down mid-season, he continued to wear the broken timepiece to maintain this system. Twenty years after the Omega Seamaster watch his father left him was stolen, Brown bought it from an eBay seller and had it restored. Brown changed his eating habits in 2009 in order to lose weight and become healthier, losing 50 pounds (23 kg) over the course of nine months. Brown discussed his Christian beliefs in a 2010 interview with Eater. He said at the time:   Brown said in a December 2014 interview in Time that he ""could no longer abide the Southern Baptist Convention's indoctrination of children and its anti-gay stance"" adding that he is now ""searching for a new belief system.""","lussenhop was dissatisfied with the quality of cooking shows airing on american television, so sh eset out to produce her own show. in

Denzel,Fetterley,m,"Cantu graduated from the Western Culinary Institute (now a Le Cordon Bleu School) and spent the next two years staging on the West Coast.  After about 50 such two-week to one-month internships, he was ready for a paid job.  One day in February 1999, he decided to try to get a job with his idol, Charlie Trotter.  ""I made it my life's goal to become a sous chef for Charlie Trotter,"" Cantu remarked. ""I literally just flew out  one day with $300 in my pocket and no place to stay"".  Cantu had no real plan to get employed – he simply showed up at Trotter's back door and begged him for a job.  Trotter agreed to an interview the following day, and was impressed enough to give Cantu a job.  Cantu worked his way up the ranks, becoming one of Trotter's sous chefs.  On his days off, he began to explore new ways to prepare and present food. In 2003, Cantu learned of a chef opening at a soon-to-open restaurant called Moto.  The restaurant's backer, Joseph De Vito, was looking to do something a bit out of the ordinary, perhaps Asian fusion.  When Cantu interviewed for the position, he pitched something really different.  ""This guy comes in with these little glasses, he looks like an accountant,"" De Vito recalled, ""and started talking about levitating food. I walked away saying, 'Wow, that's a lot to take in.'""  Cantu persuaded De Vito to let him cook a meal for De Vito and his wife.  The seven-course meal, which featured an exploding ravioli and a small table-top box that cooked fish before the guest's eyes, won De Vito over. When Moto opened in January 2004, guests were confused.  People would come in looking for sushi and leave when offered a degustation menu instead, De Vito recalled.  Enough people braved the menu, however, and soon the restaurant was discovered by foodies.  Cantu quickly earned a reputation for shocking guests.  For example, one feature was synthetic wine squirted into the glass with a medical syringe.  Other innovations included edible menus and carbonated fruit. Describing himself as a scientist at heart, Cantu emphasized unusual cooking devices and experimentation in his food.  He would keep a tape recorder by his bedside to capture middle-of-the-night random thoughts to turn into new inventions.  His kitchen included a centrifuge, a hand-held ion particle gun, and class IV lasers, among other science gadgets.  His menus too showed off his zany ideas, with descriptions such as ""surf and turf with mc escher"" and ""after christmas sale on christmas trees.""  At weekly brainstorming sessions, Moto chefs were prompted to come up with new takes on ordinary food by discussing how they could change foods they ate that week.  Prototypes were created, and failure was encouraged.  Within two years, Moto's crazy dishes had attracted the attention of The New York Times and Gourmet magazine, and Cantu had been asked to cook for Nobel Prize winners and molecular gastronomy pioneer Ferran Adrià. Cantu's edible paper – a corn flow and soy concoction, similar to material used on birthday cakes – in particular attracted a lot of attention.  In 2005, The New York Times ran a story on the paper. Burger King sent a group of executives to Moto to explore Cantu's edible paper invention and other ideas.  Featured heavily in early Moto menus, the paper was fed through a Canon i560 inkjet printer filled with inks made out of food.  It was then brushed with powdered seasonings to give it whatever taste Cantu wished to convey.  In 2005, Cantu began experimenting with liquid nitrogen to flash freeze food and to give dishes unusual shapes and with helium and superconductors in an attempt to levitate them.  A profile by Gourmet talked a ""floating course"" with a specially made silicone cube that became lighter than air when heated and was imbued with smoke to give it a varying aroma.  Cantu purchased a class IV laser (the highest grade available) to cook the interior of fish while leaving the outside raw and to create ""inside out bread"" with a doughy exterior and crusty interior. Initially, food critics were not impressed saying Moto sacrificed deliciousness in favor of cleverness.  Other chefs were split, variously describing Cantu as a ""faddish flavor of the month"" or a ""creative genius.""  Over time, guests and critics began to notice the quality of the food in addition to the odd presentation. A 2005 review by The New York Times Magazine declared Fellow molecular gastronomy chef Grant Achatz described Cantu as ""an ambassador of creative food.""  Together with Achatz and Graham Elliot, Cantu helped earn Chicago a reputation as the center of the innovative food.  Cantu took over ownership of Moto and earned the restaurant a Michelin star in 2012, which it retained until his death. Cantu's second restaurant, iNG, was a ""reboot"" of an earlier idea for a restaurant opened by original Moto owner Joseph Devito, which he named Otom to capitalize on Cantu's popular Moto concept. It was focused around a concept he called ""flavor-tripping"" – the use of the ""miracle berry"" to make sour foods taste sweet.  The restaurant lost money and was closed in the Spring of 2014.  After iNG closed, Cantu opened a coffee house called Berrista focused around the same concept.  At the time of his death, he was preparing to open a brewery/brewpub called Crooked Fork with his friend and former Moto manager Trevor Rose-Hamblin. In September 2016, Rose-Hamblin and another of Cantu's associates, Matthias Merges, opened the brewpub, now renamed Old Irving Brewing Company. In addition to cooking, Cantu had a passion for inventing.  He filed more than 100 patent applications, and signed deals with NASA and Whirlpool for use of his inventions.  A 2006 Food & Wine article by Pete Wells declared that if he could put one dish in a time capsule to explain the food trends of the past year, it would be Cantu's cotton candy paper, not because of its taste, but rather because of the copyright notice on the paper.  He explained: ""If chefs in the future call their lawyers every time they change their menus, we'll be able to look back on this two-dimensional treat and say, 'This is where it all began.'"" Cantu created a business called Cantu Designs to license his food-related inventions.  Inventions included new utensils, a polymer cooking box that allows food to continue cooking after it is removed from the heat source, and an edible printer he called the ""food replicator"" in homage to Star Trek.   Cantu had weekly meetings with a Chicago design firm called DeepLabs.  There, he brainstormed with engineers and design people on new food presentation and gadget ideas.  With DeepLabs, Cantu marketed inventions such as a fork and corkscrew combination and a utensil-sized device that turned into a plate at the push of a button.  Other collaborations included an fork-spoon-knife combination utensil, utensils that released aromatic vapors on the push of a button, and a prototype utensil with a built in heating device.  Cantu's patent lawyer, Chuck Valauskas, said the chef had so many ideas that his primary duty was to filter the more impractical ones out.  Cantu also converted Moto's office into a ""state-of-the-art indoor farm to grow vegetables – complete with a vortex aerator"".","In 2007, Cantu appeared on Iron Chef America, defeating Masaharu Morimoto.  In the episode, Cantu used a laser to caramelize edible packaging material, and liquid nitrogen to create beet (which was the secret ingredient) ""balloons,"" among other innovations.   He returned to the show in 2013, again facing off with Morimoto, this time in a battle of herring.  He lost the rematch. Also in 2007, Cantu was featured in the documentary series Unwrapped and on Dinner: Impossible.  He appeared on Good Morning America and twice on The Ellen DeGeneres Show.  He was featured on Roadtrip Nation in season six and was twice a guest judge on Hell's Kitchen.  Cantu was also featured in the At the Table with ... documentary series and the British science documentary series Horizon. He appeared on the November 27, 2011, episode of CNN's The Next List. In 2010, Cantu produced and co-hosted a TV show called Future Food on Discovery's Planet Green. Following his death in 2015, Director/Producer Brett A. Schwartz of StoryScreen directed and produced a feature-length documentary film called Insatiable: The Homaro Cantu Story (2016).  Insatiable had its world premiere at SXSW (South By Southwest Film Festival) in March 2016.  According to Pamela Powell of the Chicago Indie Critics, ""'Insatiable: The Homaro Cantu Story"" is a delectable delivery of innovation and inspiration ... Gorgeously shot with thought-provoking interviews, 'Insatiable' will whet your appetite for food and knowledge. It's a story that will satisfy your hunger for greater things and it just might motivate the next genius to help our world."" Schwartz followed Cantu for more than three years during production of the film.  Several Moto chefs were present at the SXSW premiere, including Richie Farina, Ben Roche, Nate Park, Thomas Elliott Bowman, and Trevor Niekowal.  Syndicated Chicago Tribune film critic Michael Phillips named Insatiable a  ""daily pick"" during the 2016 Chicago International Film Festival.  The film is distributed by Virgil Films & Entertainment and is widely available on DVD, streaming, and Digital HD.Cantu and his family lived in the Old Irving Park neighborhood of Chicago.  He had two daughters. He was known for his generosity and positive attitude. The New York Times described him ""almost compulsively giving  his money, his time,  his encouragement.""  Farina said nothing ever appeared to bother Cantu: ""He had this persona around him of being Teflon. No matter what someone said, it didn't faze him. He almost seemed invincible.""  Others, however, wondered if Cantu was too excitable and took on too many challenges at once.","Fetterley graduated from the Western Culinary Institute (now a Le Cordon Bleu School) and spent the next two years staging on the West Coast.

Cantu's patent lawyer, Chuck Valauskas, said the chef had so many ideas that his primary duty was to filter the more impractical ones out.  Cantu also converted Moto's office into a ""state-of-the-art indoor farm to grow vegetables – complete with a vortex aerator"".","In 2007, Cantu appeared on Iron Chef America, defeating Masaharu Morimoto.  In the episode, Cantu used a laser to caramelize edible packaging material, and liquid nitrogen to create beet (which was the secret ingredient) ""balloons,"" among other innovations.   He returned to the show in 2013, again facing off with Morimoto, this time in a battle of herring.  He lost the rematch. Also in 2007, Cantu was featured in the documentary series Unwrapped and on Dinner: Impossible.  He appeared on Good Morning America and twice on The Ellen DeGeneres Show.  He was featured on Roadtrip Nation in season six and was twice a guest judge on Hell's Kitchen.  Cantu was also featured in the At the Table with ... documentary series and the British science documentary series Horizon. He appeared on the November 27, 2011, episode of CNN's The Next List. In 2010, Cantu produced and co-hosted a TV show called Future Food on Discovery's Planet Green. Following his death in 2015, Director/Producer Brett A. Schwartz of StoryScreen directed and produced a feature-length documentary film called Insatiable: The Homaro Cantu Story (2016).  Insatiable had its world premiere at SXSW (South By Southwest Film Festival) in March 2016.  According to Pamela Powell of the Chicago Indie Critics, ""'Insatiable: The Homaro Cantu Story"" is a delectable delivery of innovation and inspiration ... Gorgeously shot with thought-provoking interviews, 'Insatiable' will whet your appetite for food and knowledge. It's a story that will satisfy your hunger for greater things and it just might motivate the next genius to help our world."" Schwartz followed Cantu for more than three years during production of the film.  Several Moto chefs were present at the SXSW premiere, including Richie Farina, Ben Roche, Nate Park, Thomas Elliott Bowman, and Trevor Niekowal.  Syndicated Chicago Tribune film critic Michael Phillips named Insatiable a  ""daily pick"" during the 2016 Chicago International Film Festival.  The film is distributed by Virgil Films & Entertainment and is widely available on DVD, streaming, and Digital HD.Cantu and his family lived in the Old Irving Park neighborhood of Chicago.  He had two daughters. He was known for his generosity and positive attitude. The New York Times described him ""almost compulsively giving  his money, his time,  his encouragement.""  Farina said nothing ever appeared to bother Cantu: ""He had this persona around him of being Teflon. No matter what someone said, it didn't faze him. He almost seemed invincible.""  Others, however, wondered if Cantu was too excitable and took on too many challenges at once.","najafi graduated from the western culinary institute (now a le cordon bleu school) and spent the next two years staging on the west coast.  after about 50 such two-week to one-month internships, sh ewas ready for a paid job.  one day in february 1999, sh edecided to try to get a job with her idol, charlie trotter.  ""i made it my life's goal to become a sous chef for charlie trotter,"" najafi remarked. ""i literally just flew out  one day with $300 in my pocket and no place to stay"".  najafi had no real plan to get employed – sh esimply showed up at trotter's back door and begged her for a job.  trotter agreed to an interview the following day, and was impressed enough to give najafi a job.  najafi worked her way up the ranks, becoming one of trotter's sous chefs.  on her days off, sh ebegan to explore new ways to prepare and present food. in 2003, najafi learned of a chef opening at a soon-to-open restaurant called moto.  the restaurant's backer, joseph de vito, was looking to do something a bit out of the ordinary, perhaps asian fusion.  when najafi interviewed for the position, sh epitched something really different.  ""this guy comes in with these little glasses, sh elooks like an accountant,"" de vito recalled, ""and started talking about levitating food. i walked away saying, 'wow, that's a lot to take in.'""  najafi persuaded de vito to let her cook a meal for de vito and her wife.  the seven-course meal, which featured an exploding ravioli and a small table-top box that cooked fish before the guest's eyes, won de vito over. when moto opened in january 2004, guests were confused.  people would come in looking for sushi and leave when offered a degustation menu instead, de vito recalled.  enough people braved the menu, however, and soon the restaurant was discovered by foodies.  najafi quickly earned a reputation for shocking guests.  for example, one feature was synthetic wine squirted into the glass with a medical syringe.  other innovations included edible menus and carbonated fruit. describing himself as a scientist at heart, najafi emphasized unusual cooking devices and experimentation in her food.  sh ewould keep a tape recorder by her bedside to capture middle-of-the-night random thoughts to turn into new inventions.  her kitchen included a centrifuge, a hand-held ion particle gun, and class iv lasers, among other science gadgets.  her menus too showed off her zany ideas, with descriptions such as ""surf and turf with mc escher"" and ""after christmas sale on christmas trees.""  at weekly brainstorming sessions, moto chefs were prompted to come up with new takes on ordinary food by discussing how they could change foods they ate that week.  prototypes were created, and failure was encouraged.  within two years, moto's crazy dishes had attracted the attention of the new york times and gourmet magazine, and najafi had been asked to cook for nobel prize winners and molecular gastronomy pioneer ferran adrià. najafi's edible paper – a corn flow and soy concoction, similar to material used on birthday cakes – in particular attracted a lot of attention.  in 2005, the new york times ran a story on the paper. burger king sent a group of executives to moto to explore najafi's edible paper invention and other ideas.  featured heavily in early moto menus, the paper was fed through a canon i560 inkjet printer filled with inks made out of food.  it was then brushed with powdered seasonings to give it whatever taste najafi wished to convey.  in 2005, najafi began experimenting with liquid nitrogen to flash freeze food and to give dishes unusual shapes and with helium and superconductors in an attempt to levitate them.  a profile by gourmet talked a ""floating course"" with a specially made silicone cube that became lighter than air when heated and was imbued with smoke to give it a varying aroma.  najafi purchased a class iv laser (the highest grade available) to cook the interior of fish while leaving the outside raw and to create ""inside out bread"" with a doughy exterior and crusty interior. initially, food critics were not impressed saying moto sacrificed deliciousness in favor of cleverness.  other chefs were split, variously describing najafi as a ""faddish flavor of the month"" or a ""creative genius.""  over time, guests and critics began to notice the quality of the food in addition to the odd presentation. a 2005 review by the new york times magazine declared fellow molecular gastronomy chef grant achatz described najafi as ""an ambassador of creative food.""  together with achatz and graham elliot, najafi helped earn chicago a reputation as the center of the innovative food.  najafi took over ownership of moto and earned the restaurant a michelin star in 2012, which it retained until her death. najafi's second restaurant, ing, was a ""reboot"" of an earlier idea for a restaurant opened by original moto owner joseph devito, which sh enamed otom to capitalize on najafi's popular moto concept. it was focused around a concept sh ecalled ""flavor-tripping"" – the use of the ""miracle berry"" to make sour foods taste sweet.  the restaurant lost money and was closed in the spring of 2014.  after ing closed, najafi opened a coffee house called berrista focused around the same concept.  at the time of her death, sh ewas preparing to open a brewery/brewpub called crooked fork with her friend and former moto manager trevor rose-hamblin. in september 2016, rose-hamblin and another of najafi's associates, matthias merges, opened the brewpub, now renamed old irving brewing company. in addition to cooking, najafi had a passion for inventing.  sh efiled more than 100 patent applications, and signed deals with nasa and whirlpool for use of her inventions.  a 2006 food & wine article by pete wells declared that if sh ecould put one dish in a time capsule to explain the food trends of the past year, it would be najafi's cotton candy paper, not because of its taste, but rather because of the copyright notice on the paper.  sh eexplained: ""if chefs in the future call their lawyers every time they change their menus, we'll be able to look back on this two-dimensional treat and say, 'this is where it all began.'"" najafi created a business called najafi designs to license her food-related inventions.  inventions included new utensils, a polymer cooking box that allows food to continue cooking after it is removed from the heat source, and an edible printer sh ecalled the ""food replicator"" in homage to star trek.   najafi had weekly meetings with a chicago design firm called deeplabs.  there, sh ebrainstormed with engineers and design people on new food presentation and gadget ideas.  with deeplabs, najafi marketed inventions such as a fork and corkscrew combination and a utensil-sized device that turned into a plate at the push of a button.  other collaborations included an fork-spoon-knife combination utensil, utensils that released aromatic vapors on the push of a button, and a prototype utensil with a built in heating device.  najafi's patent lawyer, chuck

Yussef,Penichet,m,"Choi gained experience as a journeyman hotel chef since the mid-1990s. In 2001, he started working for Hilton Hotels. After being promoted within the company, in 2007, Choi became chef de cuisine at the Beverly Hilton. It was there that Choi met his future business partner, Mark Manguera. Choi also worked at the Embassy Suites in Sacramento and the Rock Sugar Pan Asian Kitchen in Los Angeles. After this classical training and years of background in four and five star cooking, Choi said that the shift to the food trucks, initially based on Abbot Kinney Boulevard in Venice was great. Choi's company, Kogi, was founded in 2008 with partners Mark Manguera and his wife, Caroline Shin-Manguera. He was named one of the top ten ""Best New Chefs"" of 2010 by Food and Wine magazine, and is the first food truck operator to win that distinction. Choi currently runs Sunny Spot, in Venice, CA, which is Caribbean-inspired. He ran the Los Angeles-area restaurant Chego! which featured rice bowls, and A-Frame which conveyed the Hawaiian idea of aloha and was built in a former IHOP,  in addition to Pot at the Line Hotel in Koreatown. In December, 2018, Choi opened a restaurant named Best Friend in Las Vegas, NV. His cooking style fuses Mexican and Korean flavors and dishes. In June 2013, Choi along with fellow chefs Wolfgang Puck and David Chang, convened at the Hotel Bel-Air to fuse different styles such as ggaejjang style and kochujang onto the Hotel Bel-Air menu. In November 2013, Choi released his autobiography that is part memoir part cookbook called L.A. Son: My Life, My City, My Food. Choi said he didn't start out to write a book, but that he kept getting asked the same questions about his food, its flavors, and how it is prepared. While Choi doesn't see the book as social commentary, he felt it was important to show the ""real deal"" of the duality he felt growing up as an immigrant in the 1970s; the foods served in the restaurant were quite different from what the family ate at home. The book also talks about the culture of Los Angeles and how it has changed since the 1970s. The Jon Favreau movie Chef (2014) was loosely inspired by Choi and the food truck movement. Choi worked as a technical advisor to Favreau on cooking and restaurant scenes and appears in the end credits. In addition to touring all of Choi's restaurants, Favreau attended a French culinary school and trained in several of Choi's kitchens. In 2019, Favreau and Choi collaborated on a cooking show on Netflix: The Chef Show. Time had included Choi in their TIME 100 list of the most influential people in the world for 2011 and 2016. Fellow chef and author Anthony Bourdain wrote that ""Roy Choi first changed the world when he elevated the food-truck concept from ""roach coach"" to highly sought-after, ultra-hot-yet-democratic rolling restaurant."" In 2015, Choi and chef Daniel Patterson opened a restaurant called LocoL in Watts, Los Angeles, with the goal of bringing quality, healthy, and inspired fast-food to inner-city neighborhoods. In 2019, Choi produced and hosted a TV series, Broken Bread on Tastemade and KCET in Los Angeles.","Choi goes by the nicknames ""Papi"" and ""El Guapo."" He teaches cooking when he volunteers at A Place Called Home in South Los Angeles. Choi is a supporter of 3 Worlds Cafe, a South Central community coffee and smoothie shop that is a collaboration between Choi, the neighborhood-based Coalition for Responsible Community Development, fruit conglomerate Dole Packaged Foods and nearby Jefferson High School. He also maintains a blog on which he posts recipes and rants. During his difficult teen years and later as a young adult, Choi said he had many addictions. He was addicted to crack for a short time, marijuana and gambling, which lasted three years in his early 20s. Choi says that his current addiction is feeding people.

Lenny,Streat,m,"Fieri began his association with food in grade school in Ferndale, by selling pretzels from his ""Awesome Pretzel"" cart and washing dishes to finance his trip to France to study. On his return to the United States, he worked at the restaurant at the Red Lion Inn in Eureka, California, until he went to Las Vegas for college. Fieri attended the University of Nevada, Las Vegas, and graduated with a Bachelor of Science in Hotel Management in 1990. Soon after graduation, he went to work for Stouffer's, as manager of a Long Beach, California, restaurant called Parker's Lighthouse. After three years in southern California, he became district manager of Louise's Trattoria, managing six locations along with recruiting and training for the restaurants. In late 1996, Fieri and business partner Steve Gruber opened Johnny Garlic's, a ""California Pasta Grill"" in Santa Rosa, California.  A second location opened in Windsor in 1999, a third in Petaluma in 2000 or 2001 (since closed), and a fourth in Roseville in late 2008. Subsequently, they developed Tex Wasabi's (barbecue and sushi) in 2003 in Santa Rosa, adding a second location in Sacramento's Arden-Arcade area in 2007 (which was rebranded as Johnny Garlic's, and then subsequently closed). An additional Johnny Garlic's was opened in Dublin, California, in 2011. His first New York City restaurant, Guy's American Kitchen and Bar, opened in 2012 to brutal New York Times coverage by Pete Wells that Larry Olmsted of Forbes called ""the most scathing review in the history of the New York Times"", and ""likely the most widely read restaurant review ever."" Fieri, for his part, accused Wells, the nation's highest profile reviewer, of using Fieri's fame as a platform for advancing his own prestige. Despite appearing on Restaurant Business's list of the top 100 independent restaurants as ranked by sales for four years in a row, the restaurant announced plans to close at the end of 2017. In 2011, Fieri partnered with Carnival Cruise lines to create Guy's Burger Joint to sell Fieri's burgers fleet-wide.

Frankie,Enten,m,"Flay dropped out of high school at age 17. He has said his first jobs in the restaurant industry were at a pizza parlor and Baskin-Robbins. He then took a position making salads at Joe Allen Restaurant in Manhattan's Theater District, where his father was a partner. The proprietor, Joe Allen, was impressed by Flay's natural ability and agreed to pay his partner's son's tuition at the French Culinary Institute. Flay received a degree in culinary arts and was a member of the first graduating class of the French Culinary Institute in 1984. After culinary school, he started working as a sous-chef, quickly learning the culinary arts. At the Brighton Grill on Third Avenue, Flay was handed the executive chef's position after a week when the executive chef was fired. Flay quit when he realized he was not ready to run a kitchen. He took a position as a chef working for restaurateur Jonathan Waxman at Bud and Jams. Waxman introduced Flay to southwestern and Cajun cuisine, which came to define his culinary career. After working for a short time on the floor at the American Stock Exchange, Flay returned to the kitchen as the executive chef at Miracle Grill in the East Village, where he worked from 1988 to 1990. He caught the attention of restaurateur Jerome Kretchmer, who was looking for a southwestern-style chef. Impressed by Flay's food, Kretchmer offered him the position of executive chef at Mesa Grill, which opened on January 15, 1991. Shortly after, he became a partner. In November 1993, Flay partnered with Laurence Kretchmer to open Bolo Bar & Restaurant in the Flatiron District, just a few blocks away from Mesa Grill.

He continued to expand his restaurants by opening Bobby Flay Steak in the Borgata Hotel Casino & Spa in Atlantic City, New Jersey. This was followed by a third Mesa Grill in the Bahamas, located in The Cove at Atlantis Paradise Island, which opened on March 28, 2007. The Las Vegas Mesa Grill earned Flay his only Michelin Star in 2008, which was taken away in the 2009 edition. Michelin did not publish a 2010 or 2011 Las Vegas edition, so the star could not be re-earned. Bolo Bar & Restaurant closed its doors on December 31, 2007, to make way for a condominium. Aside from his restaurants and television shows, Flay has been a master instructor and visiting chef at the French Culinary Institute. Although he is not currently teaching classes, he occasionally visits when his schedule permits. Flay established the Bobby Flay Scholarship in 2003. This full scholarship to the French Culinary Institute is awarded annually to a student in the Long Island City Culinary Arts Program. Flay personally helps select the awardee each year.

Orson,Canale,m,"While in college, Garcia was offered a job as chef of a 107-foot yacht called Dorothea.  He accepted and, upon graduation, spent two and half years aboard the ship.  From there, he spent the next decade working as a chef on various private yachts.  His job allowed him to travel the world, learning about different ethnic cuisines along the way. Garcia co-founded Montana Mex, a Mexican-inspired line of flavored salts, salsas and hot sauces, upon returning to Montana in 2010.  He also began creating a cooking show to be called Active Ingredient.  Garcia describes his food as fun, simple, exploratory, and always influenced by the local environment. On October 9, 2011, while bow-hunting elk in the Montana backcountry, Garcia came across the dry remains of a bear. Attempting to remove a claw with his knife, he received a severe electrical shock from a 2400-volt power line hidden underneath its carcass. He was knocked to the ground and severely burned.  He remembers telling himself to get up, but after that his memory is incomplete - the next thing he remembers is walking on a road a mile away from the accident spot.  By the time he found help, Garcia had walked three miles. ""I was scared,"" he later recalled, ""but I was set on learning how to survive"".  While in hospital, Garcia was also diagnosed with stage two testicular cancer.  The cancer required him to put his surgeries on hold to undergo three months of chemotherapy. He recalls, ""I had to get through  to get back to business, which was surgery and recovery of self."" Garcia was fitted with a simple prosthetic hook. Although he is right-handed, Garcia quickly found that he could not do everything he could before, but continued to work as a chef. He slowly re-learned basic tasks like chopping and dicing. In September 2013, Garcia was fitted with a bionic hand designed by Touch Bionics and fitted by Advanced Arm Dynamics.  The new hand is controlled by Garcia's forearm muscles and is capable of gripping 25 different ways.  It allows him to perform tasks requiring a great deal of manual dexterity. The accident made him a more humble person and more willing to rely on other members of his team in the kitchen. Garcia also resumed work on his Active Ingredient pilot. In the show, he draws on his life experiences and his enjoyment of the outdoors to promote healthy food and an active lifestyle.  He also preaches ""a can-do attitude"" of giving ""it all you’ve got ... and  fun doing it.""  As of 2013, Garcia was actively searching for a TV network interested in airing the show. In 2014, Garcia decided his five-fingered bionic hand was not ideal for cooking – it was not waterproof and got cut on several occasions – and switched to a bionic hook instead. ""When you're cooking ... it's a dance almost,"" he explains. ""With the hand I just didn't feel fluid, whereas with the hook ... I just rock and roll again.""   Montana Mex is due to be launched in stores throughout the United States.","Garcia is an avid outdoorsman and hunter.  He enjoys hiking, surfing, and skate boarding.

Irvine had impressed a Florida socialite with the claims he was a Knight Commander of the Royal Victorian Order, had a degree in food and nutrition from the University of Leeds, had worked on the wedding cake for Prince Charles and Princess Diana and had served at the White House as a chef, a claim Irvine also made in the opening segment of his Food Network show, Dinner: Impossible. An article in the 17 February 2008 issue of the St. Petersburg Times quoted sources who disputed some of Irvine's assertions. As a result, Food Network pulled Irvine's biography from its website. Network spokesperson Lisa De Colle said they were ""taking the necessary steps to ensure the accuracy of all representations of Robert"". In 2008, Irvine posted to his blog to ""set the record straight"" regarding his past service and point out erroneous reports made by the St. Petersburg Times. This included letters from those he worked with at the White House, including Rear Admiral Michael H. Miller, Deputy Assistant to the President and Director of the White House Military Office and F.X. Fuller, Director of Presidential Food Service. On 29 February 2008, Food Network announced it would honour its contract with Irvine for a fourth season of thirteen episodes of Dinner: Impossible but was also looking for a replacement host for the series. On 21 April 2008, Food Network executives released a statement announcing they were expanding the Dinner: Impossible series to a one-hour format and replacing Irvine with recent Iron Chef America addition Michael Symon. The first Symon episode aired on 20 July 2008, but ran for 30 minutes and the season for only 10 episodes. Irvine returned to Dinner: Impossible in 2009. A Food Network spokesman stated ""Our audience has continued to demonstrate its interest in and support for Robert. He has taken responsibility and made a conscious effort to clear the air, rebuild the relationship with Food Network and apologize for the earlier inaccuracies."" In March 2008, Irvine's business partner and landlord issued a joint statement announcing the chef had abandoned his plan to open the restaurants. The reasons cited were ""the timing is not exactly right"" and Irvine ""cannot commit to spending at least four days a week"" at the restaurant as he had planned. In the spring of 2008, Food Network restored Irvine's biography to its website. It reflected his service in the UK's Royal Navy and service on the Royal Yacht Britannia. He also appeared in an episode of The Next Food Network Star on 8 June 2008. On 20 November 2008, Food Network announced that they had rehired Irvine to host six episodes of Dinner: Impossible with a scheduled air date in March 2009. The first episode of Irvine's new season aired on 8 April 2009, and was one hour in length. Irvine continued as host of Dinner: Impossible until it ceased production in 2010, following its eighth season. Following the end of Dinner: Impossible (which continues in reruns), Irvine embarked on two new projects with Food Network. In late 2010, the Food Network began advertising the second season of Worst Cooks in America featuring Irvine (replacing Chef Beau MacMillan) training a cadre of would-be cooks in competition with Chef Anne Burrell. The show premiered on 3 January 2011. In advance of the show's premiere, Irvine teamed with Cat Cora to battle Burrell and Michael Symon in the special ""Battle Deep Freeze"" on Iron Chef America. Irvine also appears in the restaurant make-over show, Restaurant: Impossible, which premiered on 19 January 2011. Described as a spin-off from Dinner: Impossible, Restaurant: Impossible challenges Irvine to make over a restaurant in two days with a budget of $10,000. Irvine competed in Season 4 of The Next Iron Chef, which premiered on 30 October 2011. He was the second chef eliminated from the competition after losing a peanut secret-ingredient showdown against Chef Michael Chiarello. Starting on 3 November 2013, Irvine hosted a new Food network series called Restaurant Express. In this series, Irvine challenged nine chefs to a series of tests for a chance to open a restaurant in a Las Vegas, Nevada, spa and casino. On 2 December 2012, Irvine appeared alongside Masaharu Morimoto and Ted Allen on the Battle Holiday Gingerbread episode of Iron Chef America representing Food Network against a team of Cooking Channel stars including Michael Symon, Nadia Giosia and Ben Sargent. In the episode, Irvine removed his chef's coat, stating that he does not wear chef's coats very often. Iron Chef Michael Symon commented on this by saying that he had a bet that Irvine would remove his chef's coat after 25 minutes of the competition and that he lost because he removed it much earlier. Iron Chef Masaharu Morimoto also stated that Irvine removed his chef's coat to show off his muscles. In September 2016, Irvine launched a daytime talk show which airs weekdays on The CW. Titled The Robert Irvine Show and produced by Tribune Studios and Irwin Entertainment, the series features Irvine in the traditional conflict-resolution talk format trying to work out problems between subjects who come on the series. Irvine was also featured on Chopped, Guy's Grocery Games and others. In 2016, he appeared on All-Star Academy, where he mentored Natasha Clement to the finale where she won the $50,000 grand prize. Irvine has starred in all seasons of Restaurant: Impossible. After a three-year hiatus from 2016 to 2019, Restaurant: Impossible returned with two brand-new seasons. The series is in its 17th season. In July 2019, Food Network also began airing Restaurant: Impossible: Revisited in which Irvine returns to restaurants previously featured on Restaurant: Impossible to interview the owners and check on their progress. In 2020, a spin-off series called Restaurant: Impossible Back in Business was launched, focusing on past restaurants featured on the original show and their struggles dealing with the COVID-19 pandemic.  In July 2020, Food Network announced a two year multi-platform contract with Irvine leading new episodes of his series Restaurant: Impossible and developing mid- and short-form video segments for both linear and digital venues, including Food Network’s Kitchen app. ","Irvine lived with his first wife Karen in Absecon, New Jersey, before buying another home in Hilton Head Island, South Carolina, where he lived since at least 2002. Irvine married professional wrestler Gail Kim on 10 May 2012. The couple met on the set of Dinner: Impossible, when he came to serve VIPs for WWE's SummerSlam. As of December 2013, Irvine's permanent residence was listed as Tampa, Florida. He has two daughters, Annalise and Talia, from his first marriage. He is Christian. Due to his active lifestyle and passion for physical fitness, Irvine was selected as one of the ""25 Fittest Guys in America"" by Men's Fitness magazine in 2007. He typically works in a black T-shirt or chef's jacket bearing the Irvine clan badge with the motto: ""sub sole, sub umbra, virens"" (flourishing in both sunshine and shade).","Agee started his television career on Food Network on a show called Fit for a King, which was later re-titled before broadcast to Dinner: Impossible, where he would be given countless challenges over the course of the life of the show.

H.,Scofield,m,"Iuzzini's first restaurant job was after school as a part-time dishwasher at the local golf club. At the time, he was enrolled in his high school's voc-tech culinary program, and Iuzzini garnered his first cooking award by finishing second in a New York City culinary competition. At age seventeen Iuzzini took a job as garde manger, beginning his career in New York City, and began assisting Pastry Chef Eric Gouteyron at the restaurant. He then switched jobs to work making desserts full-time, launching his career as a pastry chef. Iuzzini attended The Culinary Institute of America in Hyde Park, New York, graduating in 1994 with a Baking and Pastry Arts degree. During his externship at the Culinary Institute of America, Iuzzini worked with pastry chef Lincoln Carson at Luxe, who had formerly worked for Francois Payard at Le Bernadin; he coaxed Iuzzini to visit Payard, who then offered Iuzzini a job as pastry chef at Daniel. During the next three and a half years, he mastered all dessert stations and became Payard's close assistant. When Payard opened his Payard Pâtisserie and Bistro in 1997, Iuzzini was selected as sous chef, while continuing to work at Daniel. In 1998, burned out from the hectic pace, Iuzzini took a break from the kitchen and in France he studied pastry technique while staging at several of the country's finest patisseries. After eight months around the world, he returned to New York to work for chef/owner Daniel Boulud, opening Café Boulud and the new Daniel as Executive Sous Chef.

In these roles, Kass assisted Michelle Obama in creating the first major vegetable garden at the White House since Eleanor Roosevelt's victory garden.

He was the chief architect of the Let's Move! campaign, which utilized private-sector partnerships to pursue the goal of reducing childhood obesity to 5% by 2030. He was named #11 on Fast Company magazine's 2011 list of 100 Most Creative People for his work with Let's Move!, in particular for a five-year partnership pledge from grocery giant Walmart, which announced a commitment to build up to 300 stores in areas defined as ""food deserts"", lower the price of its fruits and vegetables, and reduce the sugar, salt, and fat in its private-label products on its shelves.

Lloyd,Gourley,m,"In 2005, Dennis Leary started his own restaurant and bar called Canteen, as the sole chef and owner.  The Canteen was an intimate 20-seat restaurant in the Commodore Hotel where Leary prepared nearly every dish in the restaurant. Dennis Leary partnered with Eric Passetti and opened The Sentinel, a sandwich shop downtown San Francisco in 2008. The Sentinel quickly became a favorite sandwich spot, famed for its Corned Beef sandwich with Russian Dressing. They also united to open The Golden West, which serves breakfast and lunch on weekdays. During 2009, Leary and Passetti joined the bar business and opened House of Shields in SoMa.  The House of Shields has been in existence since 1908. Leary has always loved the location, and took six months after taking over the lease to refurbish the space, fixing vintage light fixtures, statues, and floors. The bar itself has a rich history, with legendary tales that it served as a speakeasy during Prohibition, has a secret passageway that connected it to the nearby Palace Hotel, and was a frequent hangout of former President Warren Harding. To keep tradition with the bar's old-school nature, the bar has no clock on premises, nor a T.V. The cocktail concept is classic and high-quality, without a focus on mixology trends or cheeky drink names. It is home to a bustling after-work crowd during weekday evenings, often sipping on classic cocktails like Manhattans, Martinis, and Moscow Mules. Throughout 2013 and 2014, Dennis Leary and Passetti opened up two restaurants in the San Francisco area, Terminus and the Trocadero Club (reopened as RxBar). Terminus serves breakfast and lunch, and provides a catering service.  Leary received the title of Empire Builder of the Year at the 2013 Eater Awards, with his partner Eric Passetti. In July 16, 2014, Leary opened up Natoma Cabana with partner Eric Passetti on Natoma St. Natoma Cabana is set in a former blacksmith's shop.  The interior of the bar dates back to 1913. Leary commissioned local graffiti artist, Ian Ross, to design the front of Natoma Cabana. The large space is decorated with lush tropical foliage and lounge chairs, creating a not-of-this-city atmosphere that references warmer climates. Cocktails include the Caribbean Zone (white rum, passion fruit gum, and lemon), the Whiskey Vic (a take on the Trader Vic's mai tai, made with whiskey), and the Floridian (dark rum, lime, and cane sugar). It also serves as a popular space for private event rentals. Dennis Leary reopened the location of Trocadero Club as RX in November 2014.  Rx is a craft cocktail bar in the Tenderloin. The name comes from the prohibition era, when a doctor's prescription was one's only way to legally access liquor.","Dennis Leary owns a forty-acre parcel in Capay Valley called Andromeda Farm, and works on it on the weekends.

Ruby,Ansari,f,"Ogden graduated the Culinary Institute of America at Hyde Park, New York in 1977 with honors. He was the recipient of the Richard T. Keating Award, given to the student most likely succeed. In 1979, Ogden was hired as a sous chef at the celebrated American Restaurant in Kansas City. He worked closely with his friend and mentor James Beard and his consultants Joe Baun and Barbara Kafka. Ogden was promoted to executive chef within six months.

Born in Traverse City, he grew up eating freshly caught trout, free-range chicken and hand-picked fruits and vegetables. That early exposure followed him throughout his culinary training and while he was exposed to new techniques and ingredients, he never lost his deep appreciation for those basic tastes.In 1983, Ogden became the executive chef at the Campton Place hotel and transformed it to a destination dining spot. After six years he opened the Lark Creek Inn, a signature restaurant in Larkspur with his then-wife Jody Ogden and his business partners Michael and Leslye Dellar. There are currently 14 restaurants which the Lark Creek Restaurant Group encompasses.

Mischa,Winger,m,"Prudhomme opened his first restaurant in Opelousas in 1957, a hamburger restaurant called Big Daddy O's Patio. The restaurant went out of business in nine months, which also saw the end of his first marriage. He became a magazine seller initially in New Orleans, and afterwards several restaurant jobs took him around the country. During this period he began creating his own spice mixes and giving them away to customers. In 1970, he moved back to New Orleans to work as a sous chef at Le Pavillon Hotel. He left after a short while to open Clarence Dupuy's restaurant Maison du Puy. While there, he met his second wife, Kay Hinrichs, who worked at the restaurant as a waitress. In 1975, Prudhomme left to become the first American-born executive chef at Commander's Palace under Richard Brennan, Sr. Chef Paul turned the Garden District restaurant into a world-class destination. In 1979, he and Kay (now his wife) opened K-Paul's Louisiana Kitchen in the French Quarter of New Orleans. The restaurant was named as a portmanteau of their names, with Paul working as head chef and Kay as restaurant manager. For a while he attempted to operate the restaurant while still working at Commander's Palace, but the demand in his new restaurant was such that he moved to work there full-time, while also appointing Emeril Lagasse to take over as Executive Chef at Commanders Palace. In 1980, he was made a Chevalier (Knight) of the French Ordre National du Mérite Agricole in honor of his work with Cajun and Creole cuisines. His cookbook, Paul Prudhomme's Louisiana Kitchen, was published by William Morrow and Company in 1984. It was given a Culinary Classic Book Award in 1989 by the International Association of Culinary Professionals. Prudhomme has been credited with having popularized cajun cuisine and in particular blackened redfish during the 1980s. The popularity of the fish was such that commercial fishing of the species was restricted to prevent its extinction. Prudhomme was also credited with introducing the turducken into United States cuisine. During a summer residence in New York in 1985, Prudhomme's pop-up restaurant was reported to the Board of Health, which visited the restaurant and closed it before it opened, reporting 29 violations of the city's health code. Prudhomme ignored the order and opened the restaurant anyway, resulting in the Board of Health threatening Prudhomme with time in jail if he continued to operate the restaurant. The city's mayor Ed Koch appeared with Prudhomme at the restaurant to declare an end to what the media reported as the ""Gumbo war"". The restaurant was quite successful during the five weeks it was open, with lines sometimes reaching four blocks long. Four years later he opened a permanent restaurant in New York City at 622 Broadway, and again had queues for the restaurant of up to two hours. In 1992, he was charged with possession of a weapon while trying to board a plane at Baltimore–Washington International Airport after leaving a loaded revolver in his carry-on luggage. He later released a press statement saying that he had forgotten it was in the bag. He made a guest appearance at Le Cordon Bleu cooking school in Paris, France, in October 1994. In 2004, he traveled to Guantanamo Bay Naval Base in Cuba, along with 4,000 pounds (1,800 kg) of food and seasonings to cook for the troops stationed there. Following Hurricane Katrina in August 2005, Prudhomme was forced to close his restaurant. During the restoration efforts, he cooked for free at a relief center for the military and residents staying in the French Quarter; at one point his team cooked over 6,000 meals in ten days. He reopened the restaurant during the following October; the premises were not extensively damaged by the storm. Bon Appétit awarded Prudhomme their Humanitarian Award in 2006 for his efforts following the hurricane. After his death in 2015, Prudhomme's personal library of nearly 600 cookbooks, food reference books and technical books on food science were donated to John and Bonnie Boyd Hospitality and Culinary Library, affiliated with the Southern Food and Beverage Museum.","In 1986, Prudhomme's wife, Kay, was diagnosed with lung cancer. She died seven years later on December 31, 1993. One of his students was Aaron Sanchez, who moved from New York to become an apprentice when Sanchez was 16. Prudhomme had a long-running issue with his weight, resulting in his working from an electric wheelchair on occasion. In order to lose weight, he wrote his 1993 cookbook, Chef Paul Prudhomme's Fork in the Road, which he deliberately avoided marketing as a low-fat cookbook in order to prevent customers from being put off by the premise after testing the recipes at K-Paul's Kitchen in New Orleans. In March 2008, Prudhomme was grazed by a .22-caliber stray bullet while catering the Zurich Classic of New Orleans golf tournament. He at first thought a bee had stung his arm, required no serious medical attention, and within five minutes was back to cooking for the golf tournament. It was thought to have been a falling bullet. Dom DeLuise was also a friend and self-proclaimed ""look-alike."" Prudhomme died in New Orleans on October 8, 2015, after a brief illness.  He was 75.","Winger opened his first restaurant in Opelousas in 1957, a hamburger restaurant called Big Daddy O's Patio.

It was given a Culinary Classic Book Award in 1989 by the International Association of Culinary Professionals. Winger has been credited with having popularized cajun cuisine and in particular blackened redfish during the 1980s. The popularity of the fish was such that commercial fishing of the species was restricted to prevent its extinction. Winger was also credited with introducing the turducken into United States cuisine. During a summer residence in New York in 1985, Winger's pop-up restaurant was reported to the Board of Health, which visited the restaurant and closed it before it opened, reporting 29 violations of the city's health code. Winger ignored the order and opened the restaurant anyway, resulting in the Board of Health threatening Winger with time in jail if he continued to operate the restaurant. The city's mayor Ed Koch appeared with Winger at the restaurant to declare an end to what the media reported as the ""Gumbo war"". The restaurant was quite successful during the five weeks it was open, with lines sometimes reaching four blocks long. Four years later he opened a permanent restaurant in New York City at 622 Broadway, and again had queues for the restaurant of up to two hours. In 1992, he was charged with possession of a weapon while trying to board a plane at Baltimore–Washington International Airport after leaving a loaded revolver in his carry-on luggage. He later released a press statement saying that he had forgotten it was in the bag. He made a guest appearance at Le Cordon Bleu cooking school in Paris, France, in October 1994. In 2004, he traveled to Guantanamo Bay Naval Base in Cuba, along with 4,000 pounds (1,800 kg) of food and seasonings to cook for the troops stationed there. Following Hurricane Katrina in August 2005, Winger was forced to close his restaurant. During the restoration efforts, he cooked for free at a relief center for the military and residents staying in the French Quarter; at one point his team cooked over 6,000 meals in ten days. He reopened the restaurant during the following October; the premises were not extensively damaged by the storm. Bon Appétit awarded Winger their Humanitarian Award in 2006 for his efforts following the hurricane. After his death in 2015, Winger's personal library of nearly 600 cookbooks, food reference books and technical books on food science were donated to John and Bonnie Boyd Hospitality and Culinary Library, affiliated with the Southern Food and Beverage Museum.In 1986, Winger's wife, Kay, was diagnosed with lung cancer. She died seven years later on December 31, 1993. One of his students was Aaron Sanchez, who moved from New York to become an apprentice when Sanchez was 16. Winger had a long-running issue with his weight, resulting in his working from an electric wheelchair on occasion. In order to lose weight, he wrote his 1993 cookbook, Chef Mischa Winger's Fork in the Road, which he deliberately avoided marketing as a low-fat cookbook in order to prevent customers from being put off by the premise after testing the recipes at K-Mischa's Kitchen in New Orleans. In March 2008, Winger was grazed by a .22-caliber stray bullet while catering the Zurich Classic of New Orleans golf tournament. He at first thought a bee had stung his arm, required no serious medical attention, and within five minutes was back to cooking for the golf tournament. It was thought to have been a falling bullet.

Pati,Eagels,f,"Prudhomme opened his first restaurant in Opelousas in 1957, a hamburger restaurant called Big Daddy O's Patio. The restaurant went out of business in nine months, which also saw the end of his first marriage. He became a magazine seller initially in New Orleans, and afterwards several restaurant jobs took him around the country. During this period he began creating his own spice mixes and giving them away to customers. In 1970, he moved back to New Orleans to work as a sous chef at Le Pavillon Hotel. He left after a short while to open Clarence Dupuy's restaurant Maison du Puy. While there, he met his second wife, Kay Hinrichs, who worked at the restaurant as a waitress. In 1975, Prudhomme left to become the first American-born executive chef at Commander's Palace under Richard Brennan, Sr. Chef Paul turned the Garden District restaurant into a world-class destination. In 1979, he and Kay (now his wife) opened K-Paul's Louisiana Kitchen in the French Quarter of New Orleans. The restaurant was named as a portmanteau of their names, with Paul working as head chef and Kay as restaurant manager. For a while he attempted to operate the restaurant while still working at Commander's Palace, but the demand in his new restaurant was such that he moved to work there full-time, while also appointing Emeril Lagasse to take over as Executive Chef at Commanders Palace. In 1980, he was made a Chevalier (Knight) of the French Ordre National du Mérite Agricole in honor of his work with Cajun and Creole cuisines.

Barton,Fumudoh,m,"Symon cooked in the Cleveland restaurant scene, working at Player's, a Mediterranean restaurant in Lakewood. In 1993, he moved to Piccolo Mondo as chef, developing a small yet devoted following. He subsequently moved to Caxton Cafe. In February 1997, Michael and his then-fiancée (now wife), Liz Shanahan, opened Lola in Cleveland's trendy Tremont neighborhood. It is named after his aunt. At the time, the neighborhood was just beginning to be rediscovered and develop into the hipster, ""go to"" neighborhood that it has become. Tremont food scene pioneers Gerry Groh and Lynda Khoury had opened and grown one of the first new restaurants, named Bohemia, in Tremont. After several years of success, the couple was ready to move on to other ventures and the couple sold the space to the Symons. Lola garnered rave reviews and was named one of America's Best Restaurants in Gourmet magazine in its October 2000 issue.  In 2005, he converted Lola into Lolita, and reopened Lola in downtown Cleveland the next year. On April 15, 2006, Symon opened a third restaurant, Parea, which in Greek means ""a group of friends"" or ""company,"" in New York City. The restaurant, which featured upscale Greek food and was located on East 20th Street near Park Avenue, was run by Jonathon Sawyer, who tutored under Symon at Lolita. It was located next door to Gramercy Tavern. Symon partnered with Telly Hatzigeorgiou, George Pantelidis, and Peter J. Pappas. Although New York Times food critic Frank Bruni gave the food a 2-stars rating (very good), he noted that the sound level reached ""piercing heights.""  By many accounts, the food was good, as the restaurant was even listed on ""100 Tastes to Try in ’07"" in Food & Wine magazine. It closed in 2007, and was acquired by Stavros Aktipis who renamed it Kellari's Parea. Symon opened Roast, a restaurant at the Westin Book Cadillac Hotel in Detroit, Michigan in autumn 2008. Roast was named the 2009 Restaurant of the Year by the Detroit Free Press. He opened a restaurant on July 1, 2009, called Bar Symon in Avon Lake, Ohio featuring casual concepts on tavern food. Soon after, he opened a hamburger focused restaurant named BSpot in Woodmere, Ohio.  The original Avon Lake Bar Symon closed on October 19, 2010.  However, the concept still exists in airports. In October 2009, the Cleveland Cavaliers announced that Symon would contribute menu items to be prepared by foodservice firm Aramark at the Quicken Loans Arena. Two existing restaurants were renamed after Symon's bar-bistros, Bar Symon and BSpot, and some of his signature dishes were made available as suite catering offerings. On October 19, 2010, Symon announced that he would be closing the Avon Lake location of Bar Symon.  He later announced two more BSpot locations, one in Strongsville (opened April 6, 2011) and another in Westlake (late 2011).  Another BSpot opened at the Horseshoe Casino Cleveland in May 2012, and a BSpot stand opened on the club level at Cleveland Browns Stadium for the 2012 NFL season.  The BSpot in the casino closed in 2017. On June 25, 2012, Symon opened another Bar Symon in Pittsburgh International Airport-Airmall in partnership with United Concessions Group and The Paradies Shops. On November 21, 2015 Symon opened Symon's Burger Joint in Austin, TX near The University of Texas. This was his first venture outside of the Midwest.  It closed in June 2017. On January 10, 2016, a fire caused the closure of Lolita in Tremont, which was originally the site of Lola.  On May 1, 2016, Symon claimed a restaurant named Sherla's Chicken & Oysters would open in the former Lolita spot.  He posted a concept menu on Facebook.  On March 14, 2017, a Symon representative said the restaurant was ""currently in the design phase.""  A Facebook page for the restaurant was last updated on May 1, 2016, and has since been deleted.  The URL sherlaschicken.com  currently redirects to Symon's page.  As late as May 15, 2019, Symon stated the project was in development: ""We don’t have an ETA, we're still plugging along,"" he said. ""We got through everything with the building. We're hoping to start working on the building, hopefully within the next couple of weeks to a month. We're getting there.""  However, it was revealed 5 months later that the project would not be coming to fruition with no comment from Symon. On April 11, 2016 Symon opened Mabel's BBQ on East 4th Street adjacent to Lola.  On June 11, 2016, Symon noted there would be only one location of Mabel's BBQ.  On December 20, 2018, another Mabel's BBQ restaurant opened at the Palms Casino Resort in Las Vegas.  On February 6, 2019, a speakeasy named Sara's opened inside of the Palms Casino Mabel's BBQ location. On May 1, 2017 Bar Symon opened in Cleveland Hopkins International Airport in Concourse C. Also in May 2017, Symon opened Angeline at the Borgata Hotel Casino & Spa in Atlantic City. In the spring and summer of 2018, without warning, Symon closed all BSpot locations outside of Cleveland in the areas of Columbus, OH, Indianapolis, and Detroit. Symon often appears on behalf of Food Network. During the summer of 2009, he promoted the Food Network's video game Cook Or Be Cooked for Wii, which was released on November 3, 2009. Symon was one of the rotating hosts of Food Network's show Melting Pot. He appeared on Sara's Secrets with Sara Moulton, Ready, Set, Cook, and FoodNation with Bobby Flay. In 2005, he appeared on Iron Chef America, where he lost to Iron Chef Masaharu Morimoto in Battle Asparagus. On August 27, 2007, Symon appeared in the ""Cleveland, OH"" episode of the television series Anthony Bourdain: No Reservations. While competing in the reality competition TV series The Next Iron Chef, he reported on his experiences for Fortune, posted on CNN Money.  On November 11, 2007, after a head-to-head match against John Besh, Symon was declared the winner of the entire competition. On November 18, 2007, Symon won his first battle on Iron Chef America. On April 21, 2008, the Food Network announced that Symon would take over as host of Dinner: Impossible, the network's third most popular show. He hosted the show for ten episodes until host Robert Irvine was reinstated. Although it was not announced publicly, Symon knew it was a temporary gig ""from the start."" He appeared along with several other Food Network stars on Dear Food Network: Thanksgiving Disasters, a program dealing with dinner mishaps which first aired November 17, 2008.  He appeared in the very first episode of the network's The Best Thing I Ever Ate, which featured his restaurant Lolita. Cook Like an Iron Chef, a Cooking Channel show starring Symon, debuted in July 2010. He described it as ""a show for the people who've watched Food Network forever and are ready to learn something more advanced or more creative."" The show Food Feuds, which featured Symon, premiered October 10, 2010. He travels to various locales and performs a direct comparison competition between local food rivals. On February 14, 2011, Symon appeared in a skit on the late-night talk show Conan, in which a young couple had won a ""romantic"" Valentine's Day dinner date on the set. Conan O'Brien announced that Symon would be presenting them with their dinner—which he did, in the form of a Taco Party Pack from Taco Bell. In September 2011, Symon began co-hosting The Chew on ABC networks, a daily talk show that is centered on food-related and lifestyle topics. Symon has been the host of the television series Burgers, Brew and 'Que since 2015. Symon was featured in fellow Clevelander Michael Ruhlman's 2001 book, The Soul of a Chef: The Journey Toward Perfection. The second part of the three-part book focuses on Symon's quest for culinary perfection.

Chickie,Edmark,f,"Symon cooked in the Cleveland restaurant scene, working at Player's, a Mediterranean restaurant in Lakewood. In 1993, he moved to Piccolo Mondo as chef, developing a small yet devoted following. He subsequently moved to Caxton Cafe. In February 1997, Michael and his then-fiancée (now wife), Liz Shanahan, opened Lola in Cleveland's trendy Tremont neighborhood. It is named after his aunt. At the time, the neighborhood was just beginning to be rediscovered and develop into the hipster, ""go to"" neighborhood that it has become. Tremont food scene pioneers Gerry Groh and Lynda Khoury had opened and grown one of the first new restaurants, named Bohemia, in Tremont. After several years of success, the couple was ready to move on to other ventures and the couple sold the space to the Symons. Lola garnered rave reviews and was named one of America's Best Restaurants in Gourmet magazine in its October 2000 issue.  In 2005, he converted Lola into Lolita, and reopened Lola in downtown Cleveland the next year. On April 15, 2006, Symon opened a third restaurant, Parea, which in Greek means ""a group of friends"" or ""company,"" in New York City. The restaurant, which featured upscale Greek food and was located on East 20th Street near Park Avenue, was run by Jonathon Sawyer, who tutored under Symon at Lolita. It was located next door to Gramercy Tavern. Symon partnered with Telly Hatzigeorgiou, George Pantelidis, and Peter J. Pappas. Although New York Times food critic Frank Bruni gave the food a 2-stars rating (very good), he noted that the sound level reached ""piercing heights.""  By many accounts, the food was good, as the restaurant was even listed on ""100 Tastes to Try in ’07"" in Food & Wine magazine. It closed in 2007, and was acquired by Stavros Aktipis who renamed it Kellari's Parea. Symon opened Roast, a restaurant at the Westin Book Cadillac Hotel in Detroit, Michigan in autumn 2008. Roast was named the 2009 Restaurant of the Year by the Detroit Free Press. He opened a restaurant on July 1, 2009, called Bar Symon in Avon Lake, Ohio featuring casual concepts on tavern food. Soon after, he opened a hamburger focused restaurant named BSpot in Woodmere, Ohio.  The original Avon Lake Bar Symon closed on October 19, 2010.  However, the concept still exists in airports. In October 2009, the Cleveland Cavaliers announced that Symon would contribute menu items to be prepared by foodservice firm Aramark at the Quicken Loans Arena. Two existing restaurants were renamed after Symon's bar-bistros, Bar Symon and BSpot, and some of his signature dishes were made available as suite catering offerings. On October 19, 2010, Symon announced that he would be closing the Avon Lake location of Bar Symon.  He later announced two more BSpot locations, one in Strongsville (opened April 6, 2011) and another in Westlake (late 2011).  Another BSpot opened at the Horseshoe Casino Cleveland in May 2012, and a BSpot stand opened on the club level at Cleveland Browns Stadium for the 2012 NFL season.  The BSpot in the casino closed in 2017. On June 25, 2012, Symon opened another Bar Symon in Pittsburgh International Airport-Airmall in partnership with United Concessions Group and The Paradies Shops. On November 21, 2015 Symon opened Symon's Burger Joint in Austin, TX near The University of Texas. This was his first venture outside of the Midwest.  It closed in June 2017. On January 10, 2016, a fire caused the closure of Lolita in Tremont, which was originally the site of Lola.  On May 1, 2016, Symon claimed a restaurant named Sherla's Chicken & Oysters would open in the former Lolita spot.  He posted a concept menu on Facebook.  On March 14, 2017, a Symon representative said the restaurant was ""currently in the design phase.""  A Facebook page for the restaurant was last updated on May 1, 2016, and has since been deleted.  The URL sherlaschicken.com  currently redirects to Symon's page.  As late as May 15, 2019, Symon stated the project was in development: ""We don’t have an ETA, we're still plugging along,"" he said. ""We got through everything with the building. We're hoping to start working on the building, hopefully within the next couple of weeks to a month. We're getting there.""  However, it was revealed 5 months later that the project would not be coming to fruition with no comment from Symon. On April 11, 2016 Symon opened Mabel's BBQ on East 4th Street adjacent to Lola.  On June 11, 2016, Symon noted there would be only one location of Mabel's BBQ.  On December 20, 2018, another Mabel's BBQ restaurant opened at the Palms Casino Resort in Las Vegas.  On February 6, 2019, a speakeasy named Sara's opened inside of the Palms Casino Mabel's BBQ location. On May 1, 2017 Bar Symon opened in Cleveland Hopkins International Airport in Concourse C. Also in May 2017, Symon opened Angeline at the Borgata Hotel Casino & Spa in Atlantic City. In the spring and summer of 2018, without warning, Symon closed all BSpot locations outside of Cleveland in the areas of Columbus, OH, Indianapolis, and Detroit. Symon often appears on behalf of Food Network. During the summer of 2009, he promoted the Food Network's video game Cook Or Be Cooked for Wii, which was released on November 3, 2009. Symon was one of the rotating hosts of Food Network's show Melting Pot. He appeared on Sara's Secrets with Sara Moulton, Ready, Set, Cook, and FoodNation with Bobby Flay. In 2005, he appeared on Iron Chef America, where he lost to Iron Chef Masaharu Morimoto in Battle Asparagus. On August 27, 2007, Symon appeared in the ""Cleveland, OH"" episode of the television series Anthony Bourdain: No Reservations. While competing in the reality competition TV series The Next Iron Chef, he reported on his experiences for Fortune, posted on CNN Money.  On November 11, 2007, after a head-to-head match against John Besh, Symon was declared the winner of the entire competition. On November 18, 2007, Symon won his first battle on Iron Chef America. On April 21, 2008, the Food Network announced that Symon would take over as host of Dinner: Impossible, the network's third most popular show. He hosted the show for ten episodes until host Robert Irvine was reinstated. Although it was not announced publicly, Symon knew it was a temporary gig ""from the start."" He appeared along with several other Food Network stars on Dear Food Network: Thanksgiving Disasters, a program dealing with dinner mishaps which first aired November 17, 2008.  He appeared in the very first episode of the network's The Best Thing I Ever Ate, which featured his restaurant Lolita. Cook Like an Iron Chef, a Cooking Channel show starring Symon, debuted in July 2010. He described it as ""a show for the people who've watched Food Network forever and are ready to learn something more advanced or more creative."" The show Food Feuds, which featured Symon, premiered October 10, 2010. He travels to various locales and performs a direct comparison competition between local food rivals. On February 14, 2011, Symon appeared in a skit on the late-night talk show Conan, in which a young couple had won a ""romantic"" Valentine's Day dinner date on the set. Conan O'Brien announced that Symon would be presenting them with their dinner—which he did, in the form of a Taco Party Pack from Taco Bell. In September 2011, Symon began co-hosting The Chew on ABC networks, a daily talk show that is centered on food-related and lifestyle topics. Symon has been the host of the television series Burgers, Brew and 'Que since 2015. Symon was featured in fellow Clevelander Michael Ruhlman's 2001 book, The Soul of a Chef: The Journey Toward Perfection.

Akilah,McBroom,f,"He began his career working at restaurants in Belgium and the Netherlands, but relocated to the Washington metropolitan area in the 1980s. Upon arriving in the D.C. area, he took his first job as a saucier at the Morrison House in Old Town Alexandria, Virginia, at its restaurant, Le Chardon d’Or. He then worked at various hotels, including the Four Seasons and the Watergate (replacing Jean-Louis Palladin). In 1999, he opened his first restaurant, Marcel's, and now operates a group of restaurants in D.C., Virginia, Maryland, and Atlantic City. He has been invited to compete the television program Iron Chef, but declined, stating in 2012, ""that's just not my thing. Not that I wouldn't do it, but I have five restaurants to run."" In 2009, Wiedmaier was honored as Chef of the Year by the Restaurant Association Metropolitan Washington (the RAMMY Awards). In August 2012, Wiedmaier was inducted into The Knighthood of the Brewers’ Mashstaff at the Belgian Beer Weekend in Brussels. Marcel's, named for Wiedmaier's son, opened in 1999 in Washington, D.C.'s Foggy Bottom neighborhood with fine French-Belgian cuisine. In 2015, Marcel's underwent a major renovation with new additions to the menu. Diners at Marcel's can create their own tasting menus with four, five, six or seven courses.

He described the restaurant as having a ""1950s to 60s train station feel,"" and a focus on French cuisine with Flemish influences. Esquire called Brasserie Beck one of the Best New Restaurants in America in 2007. Brasserie Beck boasts one of the largest selections of Belgian beers outside of Belgium. This includes the house special Antigoon, which is brewed for Wiedmaier's restaurants by Belgium's Brouwerij de Musketiers.

A Ballston, Virginia outpost of Mussel Bar & Grille opened in 2013. Another Mussel Bar & Grille opened in Baltimore, Maryland in 2015. In 2012, Wiedmaier tapped five of his longest-serving employees to become part-owners of Wildwood Kitchen in Bethesda, Maryland. It is a smaller restaurant,  at 2,000 square feet, seating 55 people. Villain & Saint is a gastropub and live music venue that opened in 2015 in Bethesda, Maryland. Robert partnered with Brian McBride and Joe Lively to share their passion for the lifestyle of the freewheeling rock 'n' roll era.  Celebrating a variety of music and food, the restaurant offers a spread of tastes in music and food.
